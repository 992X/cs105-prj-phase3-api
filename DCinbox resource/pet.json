Every time I step on the House floor, I&#8217;m focused on legislation that will help our district - whether that&#8217;s lowering out of pocket health care costs or making sure every student gets a quality education. No matter what is happening in Washington, I won&#8217;t lose sight of the issues we face back home.&nbsp; I was especially lucky to introduce Kathy Zeman to the House Agriculture Committee earlier this week. Kathy farms in Rice County and she came to Washington to testify in support of the Local Agricultural Markets Program which promotes farmers&#8217; markets around the country.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Expanding Higher Ed Opportunities  On Tuesday, I spoke with Minnesota State about how we can expand higher ed opportunities for our students. If education isn&#8217;t affordable, it&#8217;s not accessible.   &nbsp;     Improving Rural Health CareRight now, there are insufficient health care resources in our rural communities. Wednesday, I met with folks from the Minnesota Department of Health to talk about the unique healthcare challenges facing rural patients and providers.       Advocating for Minnesota River Funding&nbsp;This week, I sat down with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and the Waterways Council to discuss the importance of the Minnesota River Dredging project in keeping the river fully operational. The river transports about 4 million tons annually, worth more than $362 Million in economic value.   &nbsp;     Pushing for Ratification of the ERA:&nbsp;Equal rights for women should not have a deadline. In fact, it&#8217;s long past time. That&#8217;s why I voted to remove the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment on Thursday.  Protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social SecurityThe President&#8217;s budget proposes cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I&#8217;ll never stand for that. Watch my video about these cuts here.&nbsp;  Supporting the Special OlympicsThis week was Special Olympics Hill Day! It was great meeting with our Minnesota delegation about empowering folks with different abilities.       Meeting Rescue PuppiesThursday, I stopped by the ASPCA Paws for Love pet adoption event to give out some belly rubs.   &nbsp;     Funding Recreational TrailsThis week, I introduced the Recreational Trails Full Funding Act of 2020 with Rep. Welch to make sure folks have quality trails to enjoy Minnesota&#8217;s four seasons for hiking, cross country skiing and taking their ATV&#8217;s out. Not only will this bill invest in these opportunities right now, but it also makes sure future generations of Minnesotans and visitors can experience the beauty of the Minnesota River Valley and our well-traveled trails from Zumbrota to Cottage Grove.&nbsp;  Upcoming Event:Excited to announce my February town hall! I hope you can join me on Feb. 19th in Savage      &nbsp;   Sincerely,&nbsp;  Angie CraigMember of Congress  &nbsp;        Washington, DC Office 1523 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC Phone: (202) 225-2271   Burnsville, MN Office 12940 Harriet Avenue South Suite 238 Burnsville, MN Phone: (651) 846-2120      &nbsp;  Open in browser window&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open plain text version    Unsubscribe        ","district":"2","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"MN","party":"Democrat","score":5.852267},{"name":"Senator Maggie Hassan","address":"Donotreply@hassan.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-12-13","subject":"Fighting Back Against Efforts to Undermine Our Health Care System","body":" ends on December 15, I urge all Granite Staters to look at health insurance plans offered under the marketplace and make sure your friends and neighbors do, too.  This week, I went to the Senate floor to emphasize the stakes of protecting our health care system from partisan attacks by sharing the story of Cassandra Van Kuren of Manchester who has struggled with the costs of treating her type 1 diabetes.  Cassandra, 26, is passionate about fitness and staying healthy. That&#8217;s why it was so devastating that a week before she turned 25, she got the news that she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Cassandra&#8217;s life had been turned upside down.  And after her diagnosis, she was immediately hit with another shocking blow: the costs associated with her condition. Within the first week of her diagnosis, she was forced to max out her credit card. And to this day she is still paying back all of the bills she accumulated within her first month of being diagnosed.    To watch WMUR&#8217;s coverage of Cassandra&#8217;s story and my floor speech click here.  Families in New Hampshire and all across the country cannot afford these reckless attacks on their health care. And they want us to work together on constructive, bipartisan solutions that improve their lives and lower their costs, not this constant uncertainty and sabotage. That is why this week I called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for blocking critical legislation that passed the House on Thursday that would lower prescription drugs costs for hardworking families.  I&#8217;ll continue to share stories like Cassandra&#8217;s and work with anyone who is serious about actually improving our health care system &#150; not undermining it. With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On This week, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee reauthorized the bipartisan Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which includes measures that Senator Hassan fought to include to ensure that family members caring for children who have been exposed to substance misuse or other trauma are eligible for necessary child support services. Learn more here. The Senate also voted to send to the President&#8217;s desk the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act, bipartisan legislation Senator Hassan cosponsored that is aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans. Learn more here.  Additionally, House and Senate leadership this week announced an agreement on this year&#8217;s national defense bill, including key priorities championed by Senator Hassan to support New Hampshire and strengthen our national security. It also includes landmark legislation Senator Hassan cosponsored to provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for more than 2 million federal workers across the country. Learn more here.  Photo of the Week&nbsp; Senator Hassan asked Granite Staters to share their snow day photos with her. Photos were sent from across the state and she selected several to share on her Instagram. This photo is of Lyndeborough, NH and was taken by Michele Gagnon. To see more photos submissions (including a few Granite State pets enjoying the snow), check out this post from Senator Hassan.

H.R. 5141 is an important step towards reducing unnecessary animal testing and promoting animal-free testing alternatives that are safer, more cost effective, and are already being adopted by the cosmetics industry.  This bill demonstrates American leadership in fighting animal cruelty while supporting our cosmetics businesses. There is no reason to inflict painful, cruel tests to animals when better, more cost effective tests exist to ensure the safety of cosmetic products.&nbsp;  H.R. 5141 is supported by the Humane Society Legislative Fund and the Personal Care Products Council which represents over 600 cosmetics businesses. I look forward to partnering with the cosmetics industry and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this important legislation.&nbsp;  Sincerely,  KEN CALVERTMember of Congress           &nbsp;  Join Me On...&nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;                     Washington Office:2205 Rayburn BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-1986Fax: (202) 225-2004 District Office:400 S.

We understand that the price of freedom is not free, but rather is paid by the men and women who have and continue to defend our country and the sacred ideals we cherish. Some of these heroes never return and others live with wounds, both visible and invisible, &#133;that they carry with them throughout their lives. Their families also pay a high price so that all of us may enjoy the blanket of security that is too often taken for granted. It&#8217;s not enough to recognize their service one day out of the year, but rather we must continuously seek ways to honor their service and sacrifice. This is what I have tried to do throughout my tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives. As we recognize Veteran&#8217;s Day tomorrow, I&#8217;d like to give a special thank you to everyone who has honorably served our nation. We owe you a debt that is impossible to repay. However, we can be mindful of President Kennedy&#8217;s words, &#8220;As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.&#8221; I renew my pledge to continue serving as the voice of the Veteran community in Washington and to always ensure that my actions and record of service reflects my heartfelt gratitude for their service.  Last week, I enjoyed the opportunity to participate in many community events, meet with many stakeholders and learn from our neighbors about the issues that matter most to them. Continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts during this district work period.  Honoring Service and Sacrifice  Last week, I once again partnered with the West Pasco Dental Association and Pasco Hernando State College to provide free dental care to Veterans in our community at our Stars, Stripes and Smiles event. Through this partnership, local dentists generously volunteer their time and provide free dental care to Veterans in our community. The Pasco-Hernando State College Dental Assistant/Hygienist students also gain valuable experience with patients. I'm working to expand dental care through the VA, because I believe oral health is an essential part of overall wellness. In the interim, these dentists are making sure that Veterans in need of immediate help get the care they deserve. I am very grateful for everyone who helped make this event possible.  I also recently enjoyed the opportunity to salute Vietnam-era Veterans in Land O' Lakes. Sadly, these Veterans did not receive the heroes' welcome they deserved when they returned from war. On behalf of a grateful nation, I was honored to have the privilege of letting them know how much I appreciate their service and sacrifice. You can read more about the celebration in this story.&nbsp;  I had the privilege of honoring several of our nation's heroes during the Veterans' Day celebration at Market Street Memory Care Residence in Tarpon Springs. It was refreshing to listen to their stories and share my gratitude for their service and sacrifice.  I also had the honor of recognizing one of my constituents, Nick Costidis, for his heroic service to our country. He fought bravely during WWII and is a Purple Heart recipient. It was especially nice that his family was able to participate in this special celebration. This local news&nbsp;story highlighted our encounter.&nbsp;  Additionally, I'm proud that Tampa Bay has just been&nbsp;ranked as the top place in the nation for Veterans to live. I am confident that we will continue to make this an even more supportive environment for them.&nbsp; Advocating for Seniors and Medically Fragile Populations  I recently filed bipartisan measure to improve seniors&#8217; access to audiology services. As someone who lives with a significant hearing impairment, I understand the value of receiving proper audiology care, and I want to be sure that everyone who participates in Medicare has access to these critical services. You can learn more about my legislation here.  I also recently filed important bipartisan legislation to help vulnerable patients. Our&nbsp;bill is about making sure that bureaucratic changes don&#8217;t jeopardize the health of medically fragile patients who rely on ventilators, such as many living with ALS. We want to be sure that these patients, who are already grappling with complex medical issues, don&#8217;t experience delays accessing care, as lapses could prove fatal. I will continue to fight to ensure all Medicare patients receive access to the life-saving care they need.&nbsp; Saving our Four-Legged Friends  Last week was National Animal Shelter Appreciation Week, and I enjoyed the opportunity to visit a local shelter in Land O' Lakes. It was a pleasure to meet the staff and volunteers who have helped transform and support Pasco County Animal Services (PCAS). Before November 2012, 83% of the animals brought to PCAS were euthanized. Many advocates and new leadership fought for a \"Save 90\" policy, and now the PCAS saves over 90% of impounded animals. They've utilized innovative practices and forged many community partnerships in order to realize this goal.  Animal shelters are vital resources for communities. A shelter is a safe haven for animals, and a great place to adopt a new family pet. Shelters also provide critical services such as investigating cruelty and neglect, reuniting lost pets with their families, teaching kids to care about animals, and providing spay/neuter services to help reduce pet overpopulation. While 63 percent of American households include pets, fewer than 20 percent of them were adopted from shelters. National Animal Shelter Appreciation Week is a perfect opportunity for you, your family, and our community to become acquainted with local shelters. Together, we can help these four-legged friends find a good home.  Working Together to Get Things Done  Government works best when leaders at all levels work together to meet the needs of the people they serve. Last week, I had the privilege of speaking with Dunedin officials about the city's federal legislative priorities. Specifically, we discussed the need for affordable flood insurance, cybersecurity concerns and local infrastructure priorities. I look forward to continuing to work with these local partners to better meet the needs of our mutual constituents.  Appreciating the Arts  For more than four decades, the Dunedin Fine Arts Center has brought art to the community through studio classes for all ages, contemporary art exhibitions, a children&#8217;s hands-on museum, summer art camps, and special events. It is truly one of Dunedin&#8217;s hidden treasures, and I enjoyed my visit last week.  Protecting our Children   I am proud to help ensure local communities receive our fair share of federal funding, and I will keep fighting to ensure every child has a safe learning environment. Read&nbsp;this local story to learn more about how I am trying to achieve this moral imperative.&nbsp;  Learning From You  Thank you to everyone who participated in my tele-town hall last week. Thousands of constituents listened in, and many people shared their thoughts about issues which matter most to them including:  &#149; Support for legislation that helps rare disease patients, &#149; The need for term limits,&#149; Opposition to impeachment proceedings and support for President Trump, &#149; The need to denounce anti-Semitic rhetoric, &#149; The importance of getting a permit for the Ridge Road extension project, &#149; Concerns with the VA MISSION Act implementation,&#149; The need to expand dental care and improve wait times for Veterans, &#149; Support for protecting the sanctity of life, &#149; The high cost of medication, health, auto, home and flood insurance, &#149; The importance of preserving Social Security and Medicare, and &#149; Problems with the VA, FEMA and other federal agencies I truly appreciate the chance to share information about the work I am doing and believe that understanding your needs and concerns makes me a better representative.&nbsp; With several thousand people participating in the call, it wasn&#8217;t possible for everyone to ask a question or share their ideas. If you did not get the chance to speak, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 727-232-2921. Your input is appreciated.  Constituent Corner  Last week, a member of my staff received the following email from a constituent who participated in my Stars, Stripes and Smiles event: &#8220;Thanks to you and your office for the assistance with the Pasco Dental experience. Please let Gus know I appreciate all his efforts for Veterans. This broken tooth has been of concern to me over the last couple years and they were able to fix it and clean my teeth. Takes a load of worry off my shoulders.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. While we don&#8217;t hold the Stars, Stripes and Smiles event every week, we do constantly look for ways to help constituents with the problems they are facing. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team had the pleasure of participating in the Metropolitan Ministries Blessing of the Tent in Lutz. This event kicks off the charitable work this organization will be doing in our community to provide assistance to families in need during the holiday season. A special thank you to everyone who is helping with this worthwhile cause.   My team enjoyed celebrating the Grand Opening of the Elite Soccer Academy International Competitive Development facility in Zephyrhills last week. It is exciting to see our community to grow. Welcome to the neighborhood!   It was an absolute honor for my team to participate in the New Port Richey Rotary's annual celebration of Veterans last week. It is always wonderful to see our community united in support of those heroes who have sacrificed so much to defend our freedom.   My team attended the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit&#8217;s Veterans' Treatment Court Regional Training Workshop. During the training, my team had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how some Veterans struggle with service-related mental health and substance use issues. I was pleased to learn how the 13th Judicial Circuit Veterans' Treatment Court is sharing its experience as a problem-solving court with other jurisdictions throughout the state. Programs within the court, such as the mentor program, keep the court on the cutting edge as a rehabilitative body in the criminal justice system. I&#8217;m proud that our local advocates are setting the standard for the state and nation when it comes to supporting Veterans.   My team was able to visit the Regency Palms Apartment complex located in New Port Richey. During the visit, they discussed recent renovations and the need for additional quality, affordable housing options in our community. I will continue to support federal initiatives, such as the Community Development Block grant, that help local communities meet this need for affordable housing.   My team had the privilege to help coordinate the first meeting of the Reentry Coalition of Pasco County. The group's mission is to help end recidivism. The meeting was held at Journey Church in downtown New Port Richey and the focus was on how key stakeholders (mental health and substance use treatment providers, faith based organization, employment services, etc.) could improve collaboration and help prior offenders maximize existing resources. I look forward to this partnership growing as we work to end recidivism.   My team enjoyed participating in last week's North Tampa Bay Chamber business breakfast. During the meeting, Colonel Al Carter, Deputy Director of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs (FDVA), spoke about the agency's current functions and new initiatives to better support our nation's heroes.   Additionally, my team was proud to participate in an event hosted by Other Side of the Dunes, a local non-profit that helps wheelchair bound Veterans obtain vehicles that they can use to navigate sandy terrain, such as at the beach. We want to make sure that our most severely injured heroes can enjoy a full life, and this initiative is part of that effort.     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update.

Here are my top 5 tips for selecting a Medicare Advantage Plan: 1. Consider a plan&#8217;s Star Rating. This measures how well Medicare Advantage and Part D plans perform based on customer service and quality of care. 2. If you rely on any prescription drug, check the drug plan to see if your drugs are on that list. 3. Make sure the plan covers nearby hospitals and other health care providers you rely on. 4. Look at the costs as a whole. Make sure you consider total drug costs, premiums, deductibles, and other costs to see if it fits in your budget. 5. If you have a chronic condition, look at how well the plan manages that condition by reviewing their coverage rules like prior authorization and step therapy. Also, a reminder my office&#8217;s next Medicare tele-town hall will be Wednesday, November 13th at 10:00 a.m. Medicare beneficiaries can speak directly with Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services officials about their Medicare plans and questions. The call-in phone number will be:Dial-in Number: 877-229-8493PIN: 116489  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;      BUILD Grants coming to Hays Infrastructure is vital to the economic prosperity of so many communities in Kansas. From roads to bridges, broadband and water, all systems must function for communities to thrive. This week, Ellis County was notified they've received a $6.5 million BUILD grant from the United States Department of Transportation for the reconstruction of four miles of road north of Hays and an extension of the existing US 183 Bypass around the City of Hays. Earlier this year, I toured the&nbsp;businesses impacted by this investment and saw first-hand the need for improvements in the city's roadways.&nbsp; This project received local, state, and federal support and will have a positive impact on Ellis County, Hays, and multiple employers.    Financial Services Summit Earlier this week, I had the pleasure to be part of a panel discussion on the growth and competitiveness of Kansas over the next decade at the Kansas Financial Services Summit hosted by&nbsp;Security Benefit. I joined Kansas Secretary of Commerce David Toland and Kansas Chamber of Commerce President Alan Cobb to highlight both what is working and what we all can do to improve the future of the state.  Kansas has so many unique and valuable assets and opportunities and it&#8217;s my job to remove regulatory burdens, keep taxes low, and improve the economic environment to make education and good-paying jobs attainable for all Kansans.    Animal Health HEALTH WEEK isn't just about human health, Kansas has become a leader in animal health and nutrition, and&nbsp;Merck Animal Health&nbsp;is one of the many companies working to develop more animal health products for livestock and household pets. Merck, located in DeSoto, Kansas, sits in the heart of the Animal Health Corridor and manufactures vaccines for livestock that are used both in the U.S. and in 47 countries around the world. Protecting the health of our animals is vital to creating a safe, secure, and affordable food system.   Fixing Hours of Service Regulations Hours of Service regulations continue to impact livestock haulers across the country, including right here in Kansas. These regulations lack the flexibility needed to address the unique challenges posed by transporting agricultural commodities, and are often misunderstood or inconsistently enforced.&nbsp; To help our Kansas producers ensure animal health and welfare during transport while also ensuring motorist safety, I recently co-sponsored H.R. 4919, The Responsible and Efficient Agriculture Destination (TREAD) Act. This bill provides for an additional 150 air-mile exemption from these regulations on the back-end of agricultural commodity hauls, and would allow for year-round use of these exemptions. It&#8217;s a commonsense step providing the flexibility needed for producers and haulers alike. &nbsp;   President's Award for Distinguished Service I was proud to receive the&nbsp;American College of Cardiology&#8217;s (ACC) 2019 President&#8217;s Award for Distinguished Public Service. ACC represents over 52,000 cardiovascular health care professionals across the country and they advocate on policies that improve patient access to care, promote heart health, and decrease administrative burdens in the health system. ACC selected me for this award because of my efforts on advocating for innovation and transparency in the health system and my successfully led regulatory initiatives with the Trump Administration. They also highlighted my contribution in advancing legislation that would streamline prior authorization in the Medicare Advantage program. I&#8217;m humbled to receive this award. Every health care initiative I take on, I put patients first, and strive to deliver fair and meaningful solutions.    Improving Rural Infrastructure Last Friday, the&nbsp;U.S. Department of Agriculture&nbsp;announced a $1.4 billion investment in projects to build and improve rural electric infrastructure that will benefit 1.5 million residents and businesses across the country. Specifically, in the First District,&nbsp;Western Cooperative Electric Assn., Inc.&nbsp;in Wakeeney will receive $19 million to build and improve 135 miles of line that will enhance system resilience and reliability for over 500 customers. Additionally,&nbsp;Ark Valley Electric Cooperative&nbsp;in South Hutchinson will receive $5.7 million to build and improve miles of line that support hundreds of Kansans.

[image = OH-14 is proud to have a portion of the Buckeye State's only national park, and now with this new visitor center, we can help people better understand the park's resources and encourage them to visit Northeast Ohio and enjoy all it has to offer. Learn more about the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, its new visitor center and the opening ceremony here [link 1]. Supporting Women in Business* This week, I was proud to vote for the Women's Business Centers Improvements Act [link 2], which would increase access to resources and opportunities for female business owners and entrepreneurs. Specifically, this bill would increase funding for the Women's Business Center Program from $18 million to $31.5 million annually. Women Business Centers operate across the country and provide a full range of technical training services for small businesses primarily owned by women. There are currently 9.8 million women-owned businesses in the United States and they continue to grow at a faster rate than any other demographic. Combined, these businesses employ more than 7.8 million people and generate over $1.4 billion in revenue. This legislation unanimously passed the House. *Providing Life-Saving Tools to Emergency R*esponders Battling the Opioid Crisis* On Wednesday, I joined my colleague Congressman David Trone and the employees of Emergent Biosolutions, which manufactures Narcan and naloxone, to talk about the life-saving resources needed to combat the opioid crisis. Last year alone, Ohio EMS providers administered 36,944 doses of naloxone. That number is more than just a statistic. It represents the lives of mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and friends and loved ones whose lives were saved. Unfortunately, the process for law enforcement agencies to establish a naloxone program is difficult and time-consuming due to regulatory requirements. That's why I cosponsored the HEROES Act [link 3], which ensures state and local agencies will face fewer obstacles in equipping their first responders with naloxone. [image = Every time I participate in a discussion like the one Congressman Trone and I had with these workers, I learn more about how we can better battle the opioid crisis and protect our communities from this epidemic. Wednesday's important conversation was no exception, and I sincerely thank everyone who participated. *Reducing the National Backlog of Sexual Assault Kits* I am pleased to report that earlier this week, I voted for and the House passed the Debbie Smith Act Reauthorization Act of 2019. Named after a survivor of sexual violence who eventually found justice through DNA evidence, this important legislation will provide funding for crime labs to process sexual assault kits, require states to create plans for the reduction of the backlog of these kits and help strengthen the national DNA database used to help solve crimes. As of July 2019, the FBI DNA database system has produced over 475,803 hits, assisting in more than 465,270 investigations. According to the National Institute of Justice, 42% of those hits are a direct result of funding provided by the Debbie Smith Act. You can learn more about the bill, which I am a cosponsor of, here [link 4]. *Protecting Our Nation's Animals* As a pet owner who considers our golden retriever to be a member of our family and as a member of the Animal Protection Caucus, I was happy to see the House pass the PACT Act this week. As a cosponsor of this bill, I applaud my colleagues in recognizing that it's past time for federal animal cruelty legislation. [image = Any form of of animal abuse or ill-treatment has no place in our society and I look forward to seeing it get signed into law as soon as possible.

We are working to ensure there are not any cures lost in our drug pricing proposals, working to help combat the youth vaping epidemic, and working to ensure Arizona's trade is continuing to thrive while fighting for passage of the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement.&nbsp;  Below you will find a review of the work I did while in Washington, D.C. this past week.&nbsp;  Protecting our Pets   I am proud to have been a co-sponsor of the Protecting Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, or the PACT Act. This legislation passed the House and will protect animals from inhumane treatment and punish those who choose to exhibit such repulsive acts.&nbsp; During my time in Congress I have worked to ensure animals are protected from inhumane treatment, and I am pleased to see this legislation take a previous law one step further to protect our animals.&nbsp;  Working to Prevent Youth Vaping&nbsp;  This week the Ways and Means Committee held a hearing to discuss legislation focused on taxing vaping products, such as electronic cigarettes, at the same rate as tobacco cigarettes. This legislation would not tax the vape itself, but the nicotine.  After several hours in committee on this legislation, I shared my concerns that only taxing the nicotine is a very limited solution to a much broader problem of youths vaping. More comprehensive efforts are needed to limit youth vaping and to address the risks of other dangerous drugs being substituted in the place of nicotine in these pods. The Wall Street Journal found that \"Majority of Vaping-Related Illnesses Involve THC Products.\" Adding a tax to the nicotine will not prevent other dangerous drugs from being used in vapes.&nbsp;  I think we should be focusing our policy to help provide resources for teens to learn how avoid these dangerous substances and to quit vaping, instead of adding a tax to these products. We found this website&nbsp;associated with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Smokefree initiative. which provides resources for teens looking to quit vaping and stay vape-free.&nbsp;  We also found a free text-message program, made from input from teens, college students, and young adults who have attempted to, or successfully, quit vaping. I look forward to continue to work with my colleagues to help combat the youth vaping epidemic. To watch the hearing we had in the Ways and Means Committee, click here.&nbsp;  Securing Cross-Border Trade I sent a letter with Members of the Arizona Delegation to the International Trade Commission highlighting the importance of cross-border trade for tomatoes to the economy of Arizona.  Arizona&#8217;s relationship with neighbor Mexico supports thousands of jobs across the state and is a driver of our economic growth. I am pleased to see the Arizona delegation stay consistent in working together to protect our cross-border trading relationships and Arizona jobs from harmful trade restrictions The full letter sent to the International Trade Commission can be found here.&nbsp;    We all know that trade largely benefits Arizona. The Arizona-Mexico Commission put together district specific graphics to show the number of jobs benefited by trade with Canada and Mexico in each Congressional District.&nbsp;  Passage of the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement is long overdue. We all know the importance of trade with our neighbors and this agreement will bring to our economy.&nbsp;  For more information about the benefits passage of the USMCA will bring, click here.&nbsp;  Safeguarding Innovation to Protect Cures   The Ways and Means Committee met this week to make final adjustments to H.R. 3, Speaker Pelosi's Drug Pricing Plan. I offered amendments during the markup which seek to improve medication adherence and to examine alternative payment models for disruptive healthcare therapies and innovation.&nbsp; Republicans on the Committee offered twenty-six bipartisan amendments to ensure H.R. 3 does not create fewer cures or stifle innovation. None of these bipartisan amendments were adopted by the Committee.&nbsp;  The Government should not be deciding to support some cures for illnesses over others. The positive health benefits and cost savings for families by curing a disease is extremely powerful. I urge my colleagues to reconsider working to include the amendments offered by my Republican colleagues and ensure while we are working to lower drug costs we are financing innovative healthcare policy.&nbsp; Constituent Casework Spotlight Our office helped a Scottsdale family by requesting expedited processing of a constituent's application for a travel document.

Bolstering Small Business Success Small businesses are the bedrock of our economy. More than 2 million small businesses make up 99 percent of all businesses in New York,employing nearly 4 million people. * This week I was proud to vote for the Small Business Development Centers Improvement Act of 2019, the Women?s Business Centers Improvements Act of 2019, the SCORE for Small Business Act of 2019, and H.R. 4387, which would establish a Growth Accelerator Fund Competition within the Small Business Administration. * Together, these House-passed bills would modernize and improve support for small businesses across the country, ensuring new small business owners, including women, are equipped with the resources and tools to succeed. Highlighting the Importance of Foreign Aid ? This week, I had the pleasure of joining my Republican counterpart on the House Appropriations Committee, Ranking Member Kay Granger, at theSmart Women, Smart Power discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. * Only 1 percent of federal spending is for foreign aid, but the programs we fund abroad change lives and have an outsized impact. * Our national security is strongest when defense, development, and diplomacy areequally prioritized and supported. Assisting a Nanuet Woman with her Medicare Benefits ? A Nanuet woman contacted me after she was denied coverage by Medicare for diabetic testing strips because, it said, she had a continuous glucose monitor.? However, she did not have that monitor. * I sent an inquiry to Medicare asking for the denial to be overturned. * Soon after, she received a call from her pharmacy informing her the test strips were covered.

While Democrats have been working to lower health care costs and improve access to quality care, the Trump Administration continues to work to undermine our health care system and take us back to a time when Americans could be charged more or denied coverage because of their medical history. More than half of Granite Staters live with a preexisting condition, leaving them vulnerable to this administration&#8217;s relentless attacks. I will continue to hold the administration accountable as we work to find solutions to protect those with preexisting conditions and lower health care costs.       Questioning CMS Administrator&nbsp;Seema Verma. Watch here.    Drug Take Back Day  Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. From 10 AM -2 PM, you will be able to safely dispose of old or unused prescription drugs at your local police department. Responsibly disposing of these medications can help prevent substance misuse. For more information and to find your local collection site, click here.&nbsp;  Preventing Future Tragedies and Keeping Our Roads Safe  I was proud to voice my support on Wednesday for the SAFE DRIVERS Act to prevent tragedies like the one we experienced in Randolph this summer when seven members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club lost their lives and three others were injured after a truck collided with their group.&nbsp; The driver responsible for the accident should never have been behind the wheel that day &#150; the individual still had a license due to a loophole where state DMVs often do not process out-of-state infractions. This commonsense legislation would help states implement electronic systems to keep dangerous drivers off our roads and keep our communities safe.       Speaking on the Floor about the SAFE DRIVERS Act. Watch here.    Securing our elections from foreign interference  As a member of Congress, it is my duty to protect and defend the Constitution and the rights therein. As foreign adversaries continue to attack our democratic process, I am proud to support the SHIELD Act to counter foreign interference and protect our national security.&nbsp;  This legislation would increase campaign finance transparency, crack down on online disinformation campaigns, keep foreign money out of our elections, prevent foreign influence in our elections, and curb voter suppression and intimidation. It's critical that we act to protect the integrity of our democratic institutions.&nbsp; Protecting Animals from Cruelty&nbsp;  I was proud the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act&nbsp;passed the house unanimously on Tuesday. My sons grew up with our beloved cats, Petey and Pel&#233;, and this legislation will protect pets like them by making animal cruelty a federal offense. I&#8217;m glad that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle agree: cruelty against animals has no place in our society.&nbsp;  Helping Sexual Assault Survivors Move Forward  The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act passed the House on Wednesday with strong support from both Republicans and Democrats. I was proud to support this legislation because no survivor of sexual assault should be denied justice because their local police department can&#8217;t afford to test their rape kit. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act&nbsp;provides funding to process DNA evidence, put rapists behind bars, and help survivors move forward. Now it&#8217;s time for&nbsp;the Senate&nbsp;to&nbsp;reauthorize this much-needed, commonsense legislation.&nbsp;  Here for You&nbsp;  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Charles, a constituent&nbsp;from Bow who had an issue of concern regarding the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS). My staff worked with CMS and helped resolve Charles&#8217;s&nbsp;issue. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.

I encourage you to review what PG&amp;E is recommending that its customers do:   Update your contact information at /mywildfirealerts or by calling 1-866-743-6589 during normal business hours. PG&amp;E will use this information to alert customers through automated calls, texts, and emails, when possible, prior to, and during, a Public Safety Power Shutoff.   Plan for medical needs like medications that require refrigeration or devices that need power.   Identify backup charging methods for phones and keep hard copies of emergency numbers.   Build or restock your emergency kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, first aid supplies and cash.   Keep in mind family members who are elderly, younger children and pets. Information and tips including a safety plan checklist are available at /wildfiresafety.  Sincerely, Anna G.

Supporting the Completion of NBAF, Relocation of USDA to Kansas City On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the&nbsp;FY2020 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies&nbsp;appropriations bill. From farmers and ranchers to researchers and veterinarians, this appropriations bill includes a number of measures to support agriculture across our state during an extremely tough time for the ag community. Many of my Kansas priorities are included in this legislation. The legislation includes measures to fully-fund the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan and provides the necessary resources for the USDA to relocate the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to Kansas City.  In addition, this bill includes measures to support the expansion of rural broadband and assist veterans in agriculture. I appreciate the Senate coming together in a bipartisan fashion to show our care, appreciation and support for our nation&#8217;s producers and all those who support this noble work. To read more on my priorities included in this bill, click&nbsp;here.  Hosting my Annual Service Academy Day On Saturday I hosted the annual U.S. Service Academy Day in Hutchinson. Throughout the day, prospective candidates interviewed with members of my Service Academy Selection Board, who submitted recommendations to me on who I should nominate to the United States Service Academies. These include the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  Service Academy Interview Day has consistently been one of my favorites, and the responsibility of nominating young men and women to our nation&#8217;s service academies is a task I take very seriously. The individuals we interview represent some of the best, brightest and most dedicated young people our state has to offer. Their willingness and desire to serve our country and attend such rigorous institutions is inspiring and makes me optimistic for the future of our country.  Thank you to the Cosmosphere Museum in Hutchinson for hosting us and to members of my 2019 Service Academy Selection Board who helped me make these challenging decisions. The 2019 Selection Board includes Bob Brock of Topeka; Myca Bunch of Garden City; Larry Burks, Sr., and Sean Ritchie of Wichita; Dennis Butler and Katrina Lewison of Manhattan; John Cluck of Wathena; Ardith Dunn of Satanta; Michael Farris of Altamont; Sue Givens of El Dorado; Robin Jackson of Hutchinson; Cheryl Kerns and Brian Kessens of Overland Park; Jayne Humphrey Pearce of Wallace; Rachael Pitchford of Dodge City; Halley Roberson of Oberlin; Mike Souder of Prairie Village; Sam Turner of Leawood; Ron Whitney of Emporia and Beth Wilson of Girard.  If nominated, applicants must then meet the individual admission requirements of each academy. The academies will make the final decision on who will receive an appointment of admission in early 2020. Those selected will enter the academies in June 2020.   A Pay Raise for our Troops This week, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense approved the&nbsp;FY2020 Department of Defense Appropriations Act.&nbsp;As a member of this committee, I was proud to have a number of Kansas priorities included in the legislation.  Specifically, the legislation includes plans to leverage the ability of Kansans to design and manufacture the future of our defense strategy, and support our men and women in uniform. I&#8217;m pleased to see our appropriations committee provide stability to those who protect our nation, and I look forward to supporting these provisions when we vote in the full Senate.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Meeting with Kansan and Best-Selling Author Candice Millard This week, Kansan Candice Millard was the guest of honor at the Library of Congress&#8217; Congressional Dialogue Series. Before a full room of Members of Congress and special guests in the library&#8217;s Great Hall, she discussed at length her book on the death of President James Garfield, which she compellingly argues was the result of medical malpractice. Candace also touched upon her works on Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill before fielding questions from the audience. Candice&#8217;s love of history and passion for our country were evident during her presentation. Following her time at the Library of Congress, I met with Candice and we discussed her work, her travels throughout the world and her home state of Kansas.    Working to Increase Housing Accessibility for our Veterans On Wednesday, I met with members representing the Wounded Warrior Project, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Blinded Veterans of America to discuss my bill, S. 2022,&nbsp;The Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019. This bill will expand the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) program and allow veterans to use this vital grant in a way that best fits their needs. My bill is named after Spring Hill, Kansas-native Colonel (Ret.) Paul Benne, who served 23 years in the Army before developing a medical condition that led to his retirement. Col. Benne has been confined to a wheelchair and used an SAH grant to renovate his home to accommodate for his disability. Ryan Kules, Tom Zampieri, and Shaun Castle are veterans I met with this week who benefit from an expanded SAH program. Thank you to these American heroes for their decades of selfless service to our nation and for their advocacy, resiliency and willingness to share their stories for the benefit of others. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to see more on this legislation.    Meeting with the National Bison Association On Thursday, it was great to meet with with the National Bison Association (NBA). The NBA represents members in all 50 states and from each segment of the bison industry. During the meeting, we discussed meat labeling, bison management and livestock hauling issues that are impacting bison producers. Each year, I cosponsor a Senate resolution marking National Bison Day to celebrate the important role bison play in our nation. I look forward to the Senate passing this resolution again this year and working with my colleagues on other efforts to support bison producers in Kansas.  &nbsp;  Discussing Rural Prosperity with Land O&#8217;Lakes CEO Beth Ford This week, I met with Land O&#8217; Lakes CEO Beth Ford to discuss issues facing farmer cooperatives and rural America. During the meeting, we discussed the importance of investing in rural broadband to make certain farmers and ranchers, as well as hospitals, schools and businesses in our rural communities, have access to the technology available today and in the future. I look forward to working with Land O&#8217;Lakes and other farmer cooperatives in assisting producers during these challenging times in agriculture.    Honoring 100 Years of the Aerospace Industries Association On Tuesday, my resolution with Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) to recognize the centennial celebration of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) unanimously passed the Senate. Congratulations to AIA on 100 years of advocating for the aerospace industry. Communities across Kansas understand the enormous impact this industry has on our state, and we&#8217;re proud of the countless contributions we make to advance this sector of our economy.  Speaking to the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police On Friday, I was honored to attend the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police annual meeting in McPherson. The annual meeting includes law enforcement leaders from across Kansas to discuss important public safety topics. Together, we are increasing partnerships between local, state and federal law enforcement officials to support our men and women in uniform and keep our communities safe. Thank you to the many men and women in uniform who attended the meeting and for all they do to serve our state. And, a special thanks to Garden City Police Chief Michael Utz for the kind introduction and invitation and to State Senator Rick Wilborn for attending.    Walking in Wichita to End Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease The Alzheimer&#8217;s Association is an incredible advocate for those living with Alzheimer&#8217;s, and a steadfast partner in our work to end Alzheimer&#8217;s. Thanks to hundreds of Wichitans for participating on Saturday in the 2019 Wichita Walk to End Alzheimer&#8217;s. It was great to be with this group that is committed to seeing a day where no one suffers from this tragic disease. A special thanks Susan Peters and Greg \"The Hitman\" Williams for emceeing the event and for all those who helped organize Saturday&#8217;s event.

Celebrating the Career of K-State&#8217;s John Pence On Friday, I joined folks from across Manhattan and Kansas State University to celebrate the career and work of John Pence as he begins his retirement. Since joining Kansas State&#8217;s Division of Housing and Dining in 1963, Pence has served the university and its students in a variety of capacities. At nearly every turn, Pence has had a positive impact on those he worked with and the students in which he mentored. One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan &#150; JP&#8217;s &#150; is named after Pence. This is a sign of the legacy he&#8217;ll leave and his innovative spirit that has bolstered the entire university. Thanks, John, for your friendship. Robba and I are wishing you and Karen all the best in this new chapter.    Hosting a Harvey County Listening Tour Stop On Friday, I held another stop on my Kansas Listening Tour in Hesston. Folks from across Harvey County joined me to discuss a number of issues including veterans&#8217; healthcare, the recently-implemented VA MISSION Act, my work to get USMCA across the finish line, climate change, rural broadband deployment, access to healthcare in our communities, immigration and gun violence. Thank you to the State Representative Stephen Owens and former American Legion State Commander Paul Sanford for attending.    Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications  My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for the spring 2020 session are due October 25.

Human trafficking is an emergency across the United States, and Kansas is unfortunately no exception. The event was focused on joining legislators, health care providers, and other leaders on this issue, with the goal of getting every hospital emergency room in the country to establish protocol for identifying and stopping human trafficking. I want to thank everyone who came to the event and a special thanks to those who participated on our panel. I am committed to continuing to fight for the victims of these heinous crimes and bringing an end to human trafficking in the United States and around the world. &nbsp;    &nbsp;      Pet Night on Capitol Hill Pet food manufacturers in the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor account for more than half of all pet-industry sales in the U.S., and these companies provide more than 2,000 jobs in the area. Many of Kansas&#8217; finest commodities go into our domestic pet food production network. Wednesday, I spoke at Pet Night on Capitol Hill, which convenes elected officials, industry leaders, veterinary professionals, animal welfare advocates, and research organizations to learn about the importance of pet ownership for human health. As someone who represents one of the largest agriculture producing districts in the country, there&#8217;s a direct link between the bottom line of our farmers, producers, and pet food companies and their employees.&nbsp;   American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists This week I was proud to receive an updated certificate of my Lifetime Membership with the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists (AAPLOG). AAPLOG is a prolife group made up of OBGYNS across the country that focus on maternal health and protecting the unborn. We discussed ongoing efforts in the House of Representatives to work with the Food and Drug Administration to swiftly put an end to the illegal sale of mail-order abortion drugs to the US. These illegal websites were purporting to sell these drugs without the involvement of a trained and certified healthcare provider to screen for complications, determine pregnancy term, or monitor the patient for possible adverse events like severe hemorrhaging. As a physician, and now Member of Congress, I'm proud to be able to continue my work on issues such as these to ensure the health of mothers, children, and patients everywhere.   Securing Trade Agreements On Wednesday, I joined members of Taiwan's Council of Agriculture for a Letter of Intent signing ceremony to commemorate Taiwan's commitment to buy $3.6 billion in U.S. corn, wheat, soybeans, beef, and other products over the next two years.  Thanks to the Trump Administration, the United States is securing fair and free trade deals for our great American workers and producers. Commitments from foreign partners to buy U.S. goods are critical to retaining good customers abroad, and growing existing markets and demand for American agriculture products.   Andrew Wheeler EPA EPA Administrator Wheeler came before the House Science Committee on Thursday to discuss ongoing initiatives at the agency. Members had the opportunity to hear about ways that Administrator Wheeler is modernizing the agency and taking steps to roll back burdensome regulations, while encouraging innovation and the adoption of new technologies to reduce global emissions and address environmental concerns. We discussed the recent rollback of the Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which represented a massive federal overreach and had a dramatically negative impact on our farmers, ranchers, and landowners across Kansas. I also had the opportunity to ask about policies impacting ethanol production across the state.   Welcoming Prime Minister&nbsp;Morrison to America I had the opportunity to spend this morning on the South Lawn of the White House and welcome the Prime Minister of Australia to the United States. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife&nbsp;Jennifer arrived to a 19 gun salute and full military band this morning. Prime Minister Morrison is the second world leader to be hosted for a state dinner by President Trump and I was honored to be there for his arrival.&nbsp; Australia is an important strategic ally and have historically proven that they are partners that the United States can count on. The strong relationship between Prime Minister Morrison and President Trump is great for both countries and will only strengthen our countries ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Raising Awareness on Childhood Cancer This week I had the honor to meet with Pottawatomie County patient advocates representing the Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) Foundation. DIPG is the second most common form of pediatric brain cancer and is the leading cause of childhood death due to brain tumors. Sadly, the survival rate after diagnosis is less than 1% and there is not currently a consistent standard of care for those diagnosed. I am working to change that. As a supporter of House Resolution 114, I am advocating to raise awareness and encourage research into cures for this and other rare forms of pediatric cancer.   Talking with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai My office hosted FCC Chairman Ajit Pai at Emporia State University on Thursday for a conversation on broadband and economic development. We brought together community leaders, telecommunications providers, and regional partnerships working to build out broadband to discuss the challenges and opportunities that come with achieving this goal, and to learn a bit more about how the FCC is working to close the digital divide. Chairman Pai discussed the new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund at the FCC, which was announced earlier this year and will provide $20 billion over 10 years to help with deployment in rural areas. As we move deeper into the digital age, an internet connection is becoming a critical component to the health and growth of our communities. It can help businesses reach new customers, connect rural hospitals with the tools to provide better care for patients, and expand learning opportunities for students. One of our local farmers was able to share about the new precision agriculture technologies available that help her increase efficiency on her farm. Unfortunately challenges with her current internet connection can keep her from utilizing those tools to grow and modernize her farm. Ensuring that our rural communities have access to these strong internet connections is vital for their continued success and economic growth.  In the News: KWCH:&nbsp;Rep.

I'd encourage everyone in the South Georgia region to keep an eye on weather forecasts, heed all watches and warnings, and plan ahead for any potential severe weather. &nbsp;  You can also download the&nbsp;FEMA mobile app to stay up-to-date on Dorian's impact to Georgia.   Please continue to monitor Hurricane Dorian&#8217;s path keeping in mind that hazardous conditions can also occur outside the storm&#8217;s projected track area.  &nbsp;  SOME VETERANS HEALTH SYSTEM FACILITIES TO&nbsp;TEMPORARILY CLOSE  Due to the uncertainty of Hurricane Dorian&#8217;s track, the North Florida/South Georgia Veteran Health System has announced that they have made the decision to&nbsp;reschedule all outpatient clinic appointments at facilities on Tuesday, September 3, 2019, including at the&nbsp;Valdosta Community Based Outpatient Clinic.  Additionally, specialty and mental health appointments at the Lake City and Gainesville&nbsp;VA Medical Centers will be cancelled on Tuesday, September 3, 2019.  Below are additional resources that may be helpful. Life-Threatening Medical or Mental Health Emergencies:   Veterans who are experiencing medical or mental health emergencies are asked to visit the nearest emergency room or dial 9-1-1.  VISN 8 Clinical Contact Center:   Veterans who require immediate urgent care services can call the VISN 8 Clinical Contact Center at 1-877-741-3400 for 24/7 support.&nbsp; This service is not to be confused with emergency services.

Pharmacy/Medications:   VA has activated the Pharmacy Disaster Relief Plan through Heritage Health. During Emergency Activation a patient can take an active, last filled within 180 days VA prescription bottle with remaining refills to any retail pharmacy and receive a 14-day supply under this emergency activation excluding controlled substances. Patient must present a valid ID. To contact pharmacy, call 1-800-324-8387 ext. 106526.  VA-Issued Medical Equipment:   If you have a health condition that requires life-saving equipment such as a ventilator, please ensure your back-up power (generator) is in working order. If you are a ventilator patient and do not have a generator or back-up power source, please contact your VA health care provider to discuss options that may be available to you. If you are on home oxygen, the home oxygen company should have an emergency plan in place. Check with them for requirements to receive back-up tanks.  &nbsp;  PREPARATION TIPS  The Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency recommends the following preparation tips:  Make an evacuation plan for your family. Secure your home and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors. Turn off propane tanks. If you have a car, fill the gas tank in case you must evacuate. Learn how to keep food safe in an emergency. Turn the refrigerator thermostat to its coldest setting and keep its doors closed. Have a supply of water for sanitary purposes such as cleaning and flushing toilets. Fill the bathtub and other larger containers with water. Plan ahead for your pets.   Please be sure to prepare in advance in the event of several weather threats.  &nbsp;  COMBATING PRICE GOUGING  In addition to an emergency declaration, Governor Kemp has signed an executive order prohibiting price gouging of necessary goods or services. Fines for price gouging can range from $2,000 to $15,000 per violation.  If you think you may have been the victim of a scam or price gouging, please contact the Office of the Attorney General&#8217;s Consumer Protection Division at 1-800-869-1123.

Sincerely,   Darren Soto  &nbsp;     What We Know:   State of Emergency: Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for counties in the path of Hurricane Dorian, urging all Floridians on the East Coast to prepare for impacts. According to FEMA, the best steps to take between now and this weekend are to remain calm, ensure you are signed up to receive emergency notifications and follow the steps (and on Ready.Gov) to prepare. Storm Information: While the exact path of the storm remains unclear, forecasters are predicting that Hurricane Dorian is likely to make landfall in Southeast Florida over the weekend. Review the National Hurricane Center website for up-to-date information.   What Actions To Take According To FEMA:   Know where to go: If you are ordered to evacuate, know the local hurricane evacuation routes to take and have a plan for where you can stay. Update your disaster kit: Make sure to have a seven-day supply of non-perishable food and bottled water, a battery-operated radio, a flashlight, extra batteries, cash, medicines, a first aid kit, pet foods, and important family documents. If you are not in an area that is advised to evacuate and you decide to stay in your home, plan for adequate supplies in case you lose power and water for several days and you are not able to leave due to flooding or blocked roads. Make a family emergency communication plan: This plan should include the telephone number of a family member or friend outside the area - a point of contact in the event of separation when a storm hits. Sign up for emergency and weather alerts: Download the FEMA mobile app for weather alerts and maps of open shelters, among other important resources.   Other Tips From The American Red Cross:   Get your home ready: Cover windows with storm shutters or plywood and store outside items like lawn furniture and trash cans to prevent them from being moved by high winds. Fill your gas tank: Make sure your car has a full tank of gas in the event that you are ordered to evacuate to safety. Don&#8217;t forget your pets: Bring them indoors and maintain direct control of them. Prepare an emergency kit for your pets with leashes or carriers, food, water, bowls and photos of you with your pet in case you are separated.

Our hearts ache for the victims and their families as they grieve their loved ones. Violence is never the answer. Thank you to our law enforcement and first responders who ran into danger, saving lives. This week, we focused on creating tax incentives for Hurricane Michael victims to ease the current housing crisis in the Panhandle and I broke down the controversy surrounding the recent National Defense Authorization Act in an editorial for the Panama City News Herald. Read more below:  Residential Recovery Zones&nbsp;Recently, I introduced legislation to address the lack of housing in the wake of Hurricane Michael.&nbsp;H.R. 3790, the Residential Recovery Zone Act, creates new &#8220;Residential Recovery Zones&#8221; to incentivize both residential development and home ownership in affected disaster areas. The Panhandle faced unprecedented losses after Hurricane Michael destroyed or damaged a large percentage of the houses and businesses in its path. While we are working hard to rebuild, many Hurricane Michael victims are facing a housing crisis. These people are having to make tough decisions and some have even moved away because of lack of affordable housing. While not a complete solution, this bill will help home buyers and spur investors in disaster areas. By incentivizing home-buying we can stimulate the local economy and make it clear to all that the Panhandle is open for business.Click here to learn more.  Educating Local VA Staff and VeteransMy staff was honored to attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Medical Center Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) Education Mobile Unit at the Lake City Veterans Affairs Medical Center recently.

A focus will be placed on reaching veterans and their caregivers in rural areas. If you would like more information on GRECC, you can visit >.  Political Theater and our National DefenseLast month, Democrats in the House passed a partisan version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). For 58 years the NDAA has been a bipartisan bill that focused on providing the necessary resources to our men and women in uniform. Unfortunately this year Speaker Pelosi politicized this important defense bill. I recently wrote a piece in the Panama City News Herald discussing the need for a bipartisan NDAA.

I would like to update you on the economic news and some of the work I did in Arizona this past week.&nbsp;  More Jobs &amp; Record Labor Force Participation  Each month of 2019 has shown a positive jobs report and record breaking data proving our U.S. economy remains a strong global leader. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data on Friday showing 164,000 jobs were added into our economy in July, unemployment stayed low at 3.7%, and we reached a record high for labor force participation which hit 163.4 million jobs filled.&nbsp;  If we want to pay for our promises like Social Security and Medicare, we must continue&nbsp; to grow our economy. To read the full jobs report, click here.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing how we can fill the newly added jobs from this past month to keep our economy on top.&nbsp;  Great Read&nbsp;&#11015;&#65039;   The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board released an article this past week that highlighted the new income inequality revisions made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This update is extremely important, as it showed that wages are going up much faster than we originally thought, and we are also seeing savings rates are on the rise.&nbsp;  For too long, economists said we could never reach the statistics we are seeing in our current economy. However, we have now proven that pro-growth policies work, and we must continue to highlight the success and prosperity of all Americans, not just the 1%, who are experiencing the benefits of a strong economy.&nbsp;  To read the full article, click the headline above.&nbsp;  Small Business Spotlights   Thank you Foothills Animal Rescue for your work across communities in Arizona to foster animals in need of a home. We gave them a Small Business Spotlight award for their commitment to saving animals and for their new location in memory of Brynne Smith, a 25-year old who died in a tragic helicopter accident.&nbsp;  This organization, started in 1995 as a foster based organization, has built other locations in Arizona to help more Arizonans foster and adopt. They have helped other pet rescue locations in Arizona too, including recently helping rescue 9 kittens from a local shelter who had no space. Their work is inspiring and Olivia and I had a great time learning more about what they do.&nbsp;  To learn more about how to foster an animal, visit their website here!&nbsp;   We gave Jennifer from Fountain Hills an award for earning accreditation from the National Home Watch Association and for the awesome work her business, Allhouse Home Watch Services, does for our community. Earning accreditation is a huge milestone, congrats to Jennifer!

Other bases included in the initial integration are Seymour Johnson AFB in North Carolina, Joint Base Charleston in South Carolina, Shaw AFB in South Carolina, McEntire Joint National Guard Base in South Carolina, Tyndall AFB in Florida, Arnold AFB in Tennessee, and Grissom ARB in Indiana. Integration of 5G technology at Robins, Moody, and Dobbins is big news for Georgia and has the potential to spur greater high-speed internet network investment and economic growth in our communities.  You can read more on this program by .  &nbsp;  BEING PREPARED FOR THE NEXT BIG STORM  Hurricane season runs from June to November, and as we all know, being prepared for the next big storm is the greatest deterrent to damage to our homes, businesses, and families.&nbsp; We all need to take the appropriate steps now to ensure that our families are ready to face any severe weather threats.  The National Hurricane Center recommends that you create a plan for your family, locate a safe room or the safest areas in your home for each severe weather event, make a plan for your pets, and take first aid, CPR or disaster preparedness classes. Taking even these few steps can make all the difference in the world when severe weather strikes.  As we were reminded last year with Hurricane Michael, hurricanes and severe weather are a part of life in Georgia.&nbsp;I urge you to take severe watches and warnings seriously and please plan ahead for your family&#8217;s safety and encourage your neighbors to do the same. Click here&nbsp;to watch a special message from the Weather Channel&#8217;s Jim Cantore and myself on the importance of being prepared before the next big storm.    Dangerous weather can strike anytime, anywhere. Be sure to make an emergency&nbsp;plan for you and your family.  &nbsp;  OUR OFFICES ARE SEEKING INTERNS  Our offices are proud to offer internships to college-aged students and those who have recently graduated from college.

During days with extreme heat, the Health Department&nbsp;recommends that you:   Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol and caffeine Reduce outside activities and stay inside in air-conditioned locations Never leave children or pets alone in closed vehicles, even for short periods Check on older, sick, or frail neighbors who may need help responding to the heat  You should also watch out for signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Their symptoms include:   Confusion Hot, dry, flushed skin or cool and clammy skin Lightheadedness Nausea  If any of these symptoms occur, you should call 911 immediately.    In the District   Congressman Elijah E. Cummings with participants&nbsp;in the University of Maryland Baltimore Summer Bioscience Internship Program and the Youthworks Program. Earlier this week, I had an amazing time meeting with students of the University of Maryland Baltimore Summer Bioscience Internship Program and the Youthworks Program. Upon my urging 11 years ago, the University of Maryland Baltimore started the Internship Program to give students in my district hands-on experience in the health and science fields. Because of this program, high school and undergraduate students are working in research labs, Shock Trauma, and several other units at the University of Maryland Medical Center, learning invaluable lessons and earning pay. The hard work and dedication of these energized young people fuel me. &nbsp;    Congressman Elijah E. Cummings joins Senator Ben Cardin, Senator Chris Van Hollen, and Congressman John Sarbanes to announce $125 million in federal funding for the Howard Street Tunnel expansion project. On July 23, the Maryland Congressional Delegation announced $125 million in federal funding for the Howard Street Tunnel expansion. The project, which aims to improve freight movement out of the Port of Baltimore, is central to the success of the region's economy. This is one of the top 10 largest projects ever funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Infrastructure For Rebuilding America grant program. The project has been a priority for me and the entire delegation for many years, and despite the many challenges we have faced, we have worked closely with the State of Maryland and CSX to support an effective public-private partnership that will be able to modernize this critical piece of infrastructure.    Congressman Elijah E. Cummings speaks&nbsp;to representatives from Wells Fargo, NeighborWorks America, and Neighborhood Housing Services of Baltimore at the launch of the NeighborhoodLIFT program in Baltimore. On July 19, I had the pleasure of speaking to representatives from Wells Fargo, NeighborWorks America, and Neighborhood Housing Services of Baltimore before they launched the NeighborhoodLIFT program in Baltimore. The program provides $15,000 down payment assistance grants and face-to-face homeownership counseling for eligible Baltimore homebuyers. You can learn more and find out if you qualify here.    In Washington   Congressman Elijah E. Cummings joins Senator Ben Cardin, Senator Chris Van Hollen, and Congressman Jamie Raskin to award the Congressional Badge of Bravery to United States Capitol Police Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey. On July 16, I had the immense honor to award the Congressional Badge of Bravery to United States Capitol Police Special Agents Crystal Griner, a constituent of mine from Gwynn Oak, and David Bailey of Silver Spring for their heroic actions during the shooting at a Congressional baseball game practice in 2017. Their quick actions and bravery saved lives that day.    Congressman Cummings questions the National Transportation Safety Board about Bus Safety. Click here to watch the question line.  Last week, I participated in a Subcommittee on Highways and Transit hearing &#8220;Examining the Federal Role in Improving School Bus Safety.&#8221; At the hearing, I asked Dr. Kristin Poland, the Deputy Director of the Office of Highway Safety at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), questions about NTSB&#8217;s report and recommendations regarding a November 1, 2016 school bus accident in Baltimore in which six people were killed. We have to ensure that this cannot happen again.    Community Spotlight&nbsp;   Ms. Gloria Cai of Howard County was selected to be part of the 2019 National Youth Orchestra. Earlier this month, I was delighted to learn that Ms. Gloria Cai of Howard County was named to be a part of the 2019 National Youth Orchestra program this summer. Ms. Cai will tour internationally with the orchestra to promote intercultural dialogue through music by playing her cello. The recognition of Ms. Cai&#8217;s talent is inspiring, and I expect that she will create great work in the future.    Legislative Update The Safeguarding Student Veterans Act:On July 26, &nbsp;Congressman Ted Yoho (FL-03) and I introduced the Safeguarding Student Veterans Act to protect student veterans using the Post 9/11 GI Bill. In recent years, we have seen a wave of abrupt closures of colleges in Maryland and around the country, particularly those operating for-profit. These sudden closings have disproportionately impacted student veterans, leaving these student veterans bearing a major burden and asking &#8216;what&#8217;s next?&#8217;&nbsp;The Safeguarding Student Veterans Act increases coordination between the Department of Education and the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to empower veterans to make the best decision when choosing their school. Our veterans have served our country, and we must honor the sacrifices they made as they transition back into civilian life and seek to better themselves through education. The Opportunity Zone Lead Remediation Impact Act of 2019:&nbsp;This month, I also introduced the Opportunity Zone Lead Remediation Impact Act of 2019 with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to eradicate lead poisoning in Census tracks designated as Opportunity Zones. Opportunity Zones were created as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to provide tax incentives for investment in underserved areas and brought a wonderful chance for many disinvested communities to receive the economic support needed to lift their poorest residents out of poverty and into the middle class. However, the program did not provide any guidelines to ensure investments made within Opportunity Zones provided for better health outcomes for their residents. &nbsp;This legislation changes that and would ensure a positive impact on the overall health of residents by eradicating lead poisoning in Opportunity Zones.                &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington, DC 2163 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515202-225-4741 Baltimore Office 1010 Park Av. # 105Baltimore, MD 21201410-685-9199 Catonsville Office 754 Frederick RoadCatonsville, MD 21228410-719-8777 Ellicott City Office 8267 Main St. # 102Ellicott, MD 21043410-465-8259 &nbsp;            | Privacy Policy     ","district":"7","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"MD","party":"Democrat","score":4.302782},{"name":"Senator John Kennedy","address":"Senator_Kennedy@Kennedy.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-07-11","subject":"Preparing for Barry","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }        Click here to open a plain text version of this email Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window &nbsp;                                                 Dear friends:  Tropical Storm Barry is heading for Louisiana, and there&#8217;s a strong possibility that it will turn into a hurricane. &nbsp;I&#8217;m praying that the storm will pass us by, but I&#8217;m preparing for the worst.&nbsp; Now is the time to make sure you are hurricane-ready.&nbsp; If your area is under mandatory evacuation, please leave and find somewhere safe to ride out the storm.&nbsp; Bring your pets with you.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t leave them behind.&nbsp; Make sure you have bottled water, non-perishable food, flashlights, a radio, gas in your car, refills of necessary medication and an evacuation strategy.

Members spend time working in their local offices, meeting with constituents, visiting local businesses, or speaking with community groups about local issues of importance. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to reconnect with and report back to the voters who we represent in Washington and who we fight for each and every day.  What we normally don't do during District Work Periods is consider legislation. That&#8217;s because almost no one is there to cast a vote on the bills. It&#8217;s understood that the Speaker will not try to push legislation through when a bill's opponents are all back home in their districts. Normally, the Speaker shows respect to other Members by waiting for them to return to Washington. Respect for the institution of Congress and respect for debate is critical for the government envisioned by our founding fathers to function.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, decided to toss aside the the historic courtesies that have been shown to Members for centuries. Without calling Members back to vote, the Democrat leadership tried to pass H.R. 2157, a spending bill to address several natural disasters that occurred in the past few years. While I support efforts to provide assistance to communities who have been impacted by natural disasters, this brazen attempt to ram this bill through without any debate is symptomatic of just how broken Washington has become.  After several Republicans drove back to Washington to object to efforts to move the bill, it became clear why they didn&#8217;t want debate about what was in it. Amazingly, less than 30 percent of the $19.188 billion package has anything to do with actual disaster assistance. The rest of the bill was full of pork-barrel spending for pet projects and other non-emergency functions. Debating the bill also would have given Members the chance to understand that 86 percent of the funding in this bill was not even requested by the Trump Administration. Members should have also been aware that the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was funded at $29 billion at the end of April, with projections of $18.2 billion in the fund at the end of the fiscal year.  While H.R. 2157 eventually did pass by a vote of 354-58, House Democrats failed to identify a way to pay for it without adding to our national debt. I will continue to vote against wasteful spending and demand fiscal responsibility in Washington in all areas. If we can find ways to balance our state budgets and our family budgets, I believe it is time for the federal government to follow suit.  In other action last week, the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties held a hearing to promote increased access to abortion. During the hearing, we heard from witnesses on both sides of the ideological spectrum.&nbsp;Amazing testimony came from Melissa Odhen, who survived an abortion procedure. As an adult, Melissa has made it her life&#8217;s mission to prevent abortions and stand up for the right to life. As a co-sponsor of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, I am grateful to Melissa for sharing her story, and I will continue to advocate for the protection of life.  I also took to the House floor Tuesday to introduce language into H.R. 6, the DREAM Act, which would have prevented known criminals, gang members, terrorists, and other public safety threats from gaining legal status through this legislation. The perverse effect of H.R. 6 is that these public safety threats who could be denied a green card will still be free to stay in the country &#150; as if the U.S. is a sanctuary nation. I made a motion that would have made it easier for Department of Homeland Security to deny gang members&#8217; applications by making it an eligibility requirement that an alien not be a gang member, and by explicitly permitting DHS to consider the information found in gang databases. It would have ensured that criminals, gang members, and those who are terrorists and other public safety threats are referred for a determination of removal from the United States. I am disappointed that most Democrats in the House rejected this necessary change to the bill.  Finally, this week ended with quiet contemplation. On June 6, 1944, more than 150,000 allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, in the largest seaborne invasion in history. The success of D-Day laid the foundations for the liberation of Western Europe, the defeat of Nazi Germany, and ultimate victory in World War II. On Thursday, I participated in a solemn ceremony at the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford commemorating the 75th&nbsp;anniversary of the D-Day invasion.  I thank all veterans for their service, but I especially want to thank the men of Bedford for their courage and sacrifice on that day 75 years ago. Twenty-two men from Bedford were killed during the invasion and subsequent fighting. It was the largest loss of life on a proportional basis of any town in the United States. Their bravery and sacrifice continue to secure the freedoms we enjoy today. May we never forget the men of Bedford and the courage of all those who have fought for the greatest Nation on Earth, the United States of America.                 Washington D.C.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates hurricane winds and storm related flooding will cost the U.S. economy $54 billion this year. The toll on our communities will continue to worsen with each coming season as storms get stronger as a result of rising global temperatures and sea levels caused by surging greenhouse gas emissions. Looking back on the devastating effects of Hurricanes Florence and Michael last year, it is imperative we take the necessary precautions to protect our families, homes, businesses and communities.  The following information was compiled with resources from federal agencies and will help you prepare for severe weather in Connecticut.  Be Prepared  Every family should have a plan to respond to an upcoming storm. I encourage you to use the information below to help you craft your own plan.   Discuss the types of hazards or storms that your family and home may encounter. What supplies would you need? How would your family stay in contact with each other? Keep important documents in a secure place or create password-protected digital copies. Identify safe areas for your family in the event of a storm hazard. These areas may not be in your home but could be elsewhere in your community. Familiarize yourself with evacuation routes, especially if you live close to the coast. Determine escape routes from your home and other places to meet. Craft an evacuation plan should circumstances require you to leave town. Appoint an out-of-state friend as a single point of contact for all family members to check in with at designated times. Make a plan for your pets in the event of an evacuation. Some hotels do not allow pets, but most do in the case of emergency. Post emergency telephone numbers by your phones. Make sure your children know how and when to call 9-1-1. Create a disaster supply kit. Stock it with non-perishable emergency food, water, first-aid necessities, supplies, flashlights, a battery-powered radio and extra batteries. Remember to fully charge any electronic devices you may need in the lead up to the storm.         Click to watch my YouTube video on storm preparedness with Jim Cantore from The Weather Channel  &nbsp;      Stay Informed The State of Connecticut uses the CT Alert Emergency Notification System to notify residents of emergencies. This system allows you to receive updates via text or email and will notify you of changing weather, evacuation orders, and other timely information, even if you lose power or do not have radio or tv access. Click here to register for these updates.  I also encourage you to sign up for my e-newsletter for important updates. I will pass along helpful information in the event of a major storm. Please remember that although I will send email updates as quickly as circumstances will allow, your local first responders and Emergency Operations Centers will be able to provide the best information and assistance should a dangerous situation arise.

God bless our military and their families.&nbsp;  Combating Valley Fever   I am pleased to announce the FORWARD Act, legislation to combat Valley Fever and support research to find a cure&nbsp;has been introduced in the House and Senate.  Since being in Congress, we have created the Valley Fever Task Force, a caucus to help educate Members of Congress about this orphan fungal disease found in the Southwest. Now, we have introduced legislation that helps to combat this disease. My colleague Rep. Kevin McCarthy and I have held round tables, met with researchers and scientists, and have learned so much about this disease. It is great to see this legislation bring attention to this disease, and to help those infected.&nbsp;  Every year, our community sees increased rates of Valley Fever. This legislation pushes for a breakthrough in research, it also introduces the first blockchain pilot program for collecting data for fungal diseases. As scientists are getting closer to a cure for valley fever [soon a vaccination for our pets], I look forward to seeing how the critical resources provided in this legislation will positively impact the southwest. We are extremely hopeful that a cure is in our near future.&nbsp;  If you would like to learn more about the legislation, click here.&nbsp;  Celebrating the 19th Amendment   100 years ago, the 19th Amendment passed the U.S. House of Representatives to give women the right to vote.

I wore a yellow rose in honor of this anniversary, just as supporters of women's suffrage did a century ago.&nbsp;  Securing Retirement Savings   This week, I voted for the SECURE Act, bipartisan legislation to help Americans save for retirement.

To say that I'm disappointed in the direction of this committee is an understatement. I was sent here to get things done, and I feel like my colleagues across the aisle have been chasing a ghost for the last two years. During that time, we've suffered from an opioid pandemic. I say pandemic because it's everywhere in the United States, and it's killing thousands of individuals. We have real problems to address in our country, such as immigration. By moving to a merit-based system, we could bring our country into step with the rest of the industrialized world. I have two bipartisan bills that I'm introducing with my Democratic colleagues that could really make a difference (H.R. 2368 [link 2] and H.R. [link 3]2348 [link 4]). But instead, we've been engaging in political theater, bringing in props, and just chasing this ghost for the last two years. We've already pointed out that Attorney General Barr has been incredibly transparent and the Department of Justice has been more than accommodating, but Chairman Nadler continues to move at an unprecedented speed toward the Democrats' true goal: impeaching President Trump. To watch the full clip of my remarks, please click here [link 5]. *Introducing Legislation to Support Law Enforcement Officers, Improve Mental Health Care* In an effort to improve mental health treatment and support for our nation's law enforcement officers, I recently joined with Rep. Madeleine Dean (PA-04) to introduce H.R. 2368, the *Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis (STOIC) Act.* This bipartisan legislation will reform and expand an existing grant program to better address the mental health and support needs of law enforcement officers, especially as it relates to suicide prevention. Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities. These men and women routinely endure extremely stressful situations, yet the federal government does little to address the consequences of this taxing work. This stress can cause high blood pressure and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has resulted in a suicide rate that is 50 percent higher than the national average. I am proud to work with Congresswoman Dean to fix this wrong and support police officers and their families. According to the National Study of Police Suicides, officers are 2.5 times more likely to die from suicides than from homicides. This sobering statistic means that law enforcement officers are more likely to die from suicide than in the line of duty. The *STOIC Act* would address this problem by allowing family-services grant program funding to be used to establish suicide prevention programs and support officers suffering stress and mental health issues. The program would be authorized at $7.5 million annually for Fiscal Years 2020 through 2024. This legislation has been endorsed by: - Fraternal Order of Police [link 6] - National Sheriff's Association - Major County Sheriffs of America - National Association of Police Organizations [link 7] - American Foundation for Suicide Prevention [link 8] - National District Attorney's Association - Sergeants Benevolent Association [link 9] It is time for us to take care of those who take care of us. I hope my colleagues in the House will prioritize the mental health of our law enforcement officers by supporting the *STOIC Act.* *Since coming to Congress, it has been an honor to represent sailors, airmen, marines, and soldiers. Last week, I welcomed Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer in my D.C. office, where we discussed the importance of maritime superiority, a strengthened fleet, and increased readiness.* [image = *Voting Against Legislation to Cripple the U.S. Energy Sector* Last week, I voted to protect jobs and further economic growth by opposing H.R. 9, a bill that would prevent President Donald J. Trump from withdrawing from the Obama Administration's costly Paris Agreement commitments. I support President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. This was an unfair deal that put our country at a disadvantage by giving a free pass to India and China, while forcing unrealistic demands on our national economy. As our nation reaches its energy dominance and continues to reduce emissions through innovation, House Democrats want us to put our economic growth, jobs, and security at risk by forcing President Trump to implement the Paris Agreement. The U.S. has already seen the largest absolute decline in emissions among all countries since 2000, according to the International Energy Agency. Between 2000 and 2014, our nation reduced emissions by more than 18 percent. The Paris Agreement would yield the following outcomes by 2035: - An overall average shortfall of nearly 400,000 jobs; - An average manufacturing shortfall of over 200,000 jobs; - A total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four; - An aggregate gross domestic product loss of over $2.5 trillion; and - Increases in household electricity expenditures between 13 percent and 20 percent. I opposed H.R. 9 to protect jobs for hardworking Pennsylvanians and the families who rely on them. I support an energy proposal that expands and improves our energy infrastructure, invests in new and emerging technologies, and increases our nation's role in promoting global energy security. *I was honored to welcome Lithuania's Ambassador to the US Rolandas Krisciunas to my DC office this week, where we discussed opportunities for cooperation between our nations.* [image = *Introducing Legislation to Protect Puppies* I recently joined with my colleagues Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Charlie Crist (FL-13), and Jim McGovern (MA-02) to introduce the *Puppy Protection Act*, which will provide better protection for puppies by improving standards for federally licensed commercial dog breeders. I have long championed legislation that protects our nation's animals from abuse and neglect. By moving toward more humane standards for commercial dog breeders in our country, this bill will promote animal welfare and provide enhanced protections for the puppies throughout our country. I hope these efforts will improve the lives of our dogs and defend these creatures who cannot defend themselves. Too many of our dogs currently suffer from inhumane conditions, but I look forward to working with my colleagues Representatives Fitzpatrick, Crist, and McGovern to provide protections for these animals in the future. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates federally licensed commercial dog breeders that sell dogs wholesale to retail pet stores and commercial brokers, or directly to consumers over the Internet under the *Animal Welfare Act.* While the *Animal Welfare Act *is meant to ensure dogs in federally licensed facilities are treated humanely, the current regulations fall far short. The *Puppy Protection Act* creates stronger standards for veterinary care, housing, breeding practices, and specific standards for socialization and placement of retired breeding dogs. The* Puppy Protection Act* will not impact family pets, livestock, or hobbyist breeders. \"We envision a day when a puppy will never again find her paws and legs trapped in the wire flooring of a stacked cage at a puppy mill. The *Puppy Protection Act* will strengthen baseline standards of care that must be provided by large commercial dog breeder. Thank you to the leadership of Reps. Fitzpatrick, Crist, McGovern, and Reschenthaler for introducing this important bipartisan measure to improve the living conditions of dogs and puppies. We will fight to support its passage.\" - *Sara Amundson, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund* \"The *Puppy Protection Act* will help improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of dogs kept in inhumane conditions by federally licensed commercial breeders. Current regulations allow dogs in federally licensed facilities to spend their entire lives in filthy, crowded cages stacked on top of one another with no access to adequate veterinary care or regular exercise. We thank Representatives Fitzpatrick, Crist, Reschenthaler, and McGovern for their continued leadership on the *Puppy Protection Act* and call upon USDA to ensure the thorough and proper enforcement of the *Animal Welfare Act*.\" - *Richard Patch, vice president of federal affairs for the ASPCA* \"AWI thanks Reps. Fitzpatrick, Crist, Reschenthaler, and McGovern for their efforts to update and enhance the requirements for the care of dogs in breeding facilities. Such improvements are long overdue for both breeding facilities and all entities regulated under the *Animal Welfare Act* - *Nancy Blaney, Director of Government Affairs at **Animal Welfare Institute* *Thanks to the PA Association of Community Bankers for meeting to discuss ways to work with our local banks to create jobs in our communities.* [image = *Introducing Bipartisan Legislation to Allow Servicemembers to Sue for Medical Malpractice* I recently joined with my colleagues Reps. Jackie Speier (D-CA), Richard Hudson (R-NC), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), and Charlie Crist (D-FL), to introduce the *Sergeant First Class Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act* *of* *2019*, which would allow military servicemembers to bring claims against the federal government for instances of medical malpractice unrelated to their military duties. SFC Stayskal developed terminal lung cancer after being misdiagnosed in a military health facility. America's servicemembers and their families make tremendous sacrifices to protect our freedoms, yet we deny them the ability to seek justice for injury or death caused by negligence at military medical facilities. I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to correct this wrong. Our troops deserve better. For nearly 70 years, servicemembers have not been able to bring claims against military medical providers after being misdiagnosed, mistreated, or subjected to botched surgeries, even though this malpractice occurred in health care settings in which almost all other Americans have that right. This legislation seeks to fix the Feres Doctrine by allowing servicemembers and their families to sue the military for medical malpractice. It is important to note that this legislation excludes treatment received in combat, including battalion aid stations or other medical treatment locations deployed in an area of armed conflict. This bill is supported by the following organizations: - Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) - Blue Star Families - Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) - National Military Family Association - The Retired Enlisted Association (TREA) - Sea Service Family Foundation - Service Women's Action Network - Center for Law and Military Policy - Protect Our Defenders (POD) ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] [link 9] Contact information: Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 531 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-2065 Greensburg Office 700 Pellis Road, Suite 1 Greensburg, PA 15601 Phone: (724) 219-4200 Washington District Office 14 S.

Morgan Griffith","address":"Griffith.News@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-04-01","subject":"Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 4.1.19","body":"The Ninth District: On the Cutting Edge of Biological Engineering for Health Care When not in Washington, D.C., voting in the U.S. House of Representatives during March, I was able to visit several sites where exciting research projects are underway. Previously, I wrote about some of them at Virginia Tech. More recently, I visited a farm site where scientific accomplishments once seemingly from the realm of a futuristic novel promise to make a difference in our daily lives. You may remember Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned with an adult cell. Dolly was cloned in Scotland in 1996 and died in 2003, and if you ever visit the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, you can see her taxidermied remains. The technology that created her continues to be advanced, refined, and put to new uses. Some of that work is being done here in Southwest Virginia, thanks to a connection with Dolly: Virginia Tech had a stake in the entity that cloned her. While the company that cloned Dolly no longer exists, in the years since she was cloned, related research has continued in our area, with the Blacksburg-based company Revivicor, which spun off from the company that created Dolly, developing technology for cloning and genetically modifying pigs. During my visit to the farm where the genetically-modified cloned pigs are kept, which is located in the Ninth District, I saw that the pigs do not look different from any other pig. They are treated well, almost like pets. Unlike normal pigs, however, they potentially hold new advances in biological engineering for health purposes. For example, they potentially offer a new source for organs that can be transplanted to the people in need of them. These special pigs organs have similarities to ours that could make them suitable for transplanting, providing a new source of organs for people waiting on them. People with diabetes may also stand to benefit from this research, as certain cells from these genetically-modified pigs could be transplanted into a human pancreas to increase insulin production for those who need it. Cloning genetically-modified pigs offer more than just a new source of organs for transplant. Scientists are working on ways to use cloned pigs to help people overcome particular food allergies. The alpha-gal allergy has become more prevalent in the southeastern United States in recent years; one estimate suggests that up to 30 percent of people in the region have it. It is spread by Lone Star tick bites, which introduce alpha-gal molecules into the body. People who acquire this allergy suffer adverse effects, such as itching, swelling, and anaphylaxis, when eating red meat such as beef, lamb, pork, and venison. Essentially any four-legged animals commonly brought to the dinner table become off-limits to a person with the alpha-gal allergy, even if he or she had previously been able to consume them. It imposes disappointing dietary restrictions on many. Other deleterious effects impact the health of people with the alpha-gal allergy. Exposure to other products that come from mammals, not just food, can trigger allergic reactions. As an example, a small percentage of people would be affected by the gelatin sometimes used as an ingredient in medical products, such as capsules. Further, there are some indications that the allergy may contribute to heart disease. Now how do these cloned pigs relate to this problem? By splicing genes, eliminating the alpha-gal gene and adding others, researchers can create genetically-modified cloned pigs that do not produce the alpha-gal protein. Products derived from them, from food to medications, will not trigger allergic reactions. It is exciting to know that this research, which could make a positive difference in the lives of men and women around the world, is being done in our backyard. The work I discussed in this column is just the tip of the iceberg of potential benefits. Of course, as always with new fields of scientific research, propriety and ethics must be taken into consideration. The biological engineering sector has a firm foothold in Southwest Virginia, drawing people and investment into our region. Just as there is a long way between Dolly the sheep and the progress yielded in these cloned pigs, the successes of this industry in our region may shape our world in new and unlikely ways.

Sustained winds of 40-50 mph and gusts of up to 65 mph left thousands without power in our region and across the state of Ohio. We thank our first responders and electrical workers for their hard work to keep people safe and mitigate the damage. In Washington, there have been a number of proposals from Democrats that received much attention. One proposal that has been in the news lately has been the \"Green New Deal.\" The Green New Deal is an irresponsible proposal that would cost $93 trillion dollars over the next ten years and change much of our way of life. To put that cost in perspective, its $600,000 per American family. In addition, Democrats introduced Medicare-for-All healthcare legislation this week. Make no mistake, this is government-run, single-payer health care. Medicare-for-All would cost $32 trillion dollars, end employer-sponsored health care (throwing 500,000 of my constituents off of their healthcare plans), and drastically reduce access to health care in rural communities. Its important we work in a bipartisan way in Washington to find solutions to the problems that Americans face, including protecting the environment and addressing rising health care costs. However, these proposals would be devastating to the constituents I represent, and I cant support them. An update on other recent happenings: In Congress Breaking Down Barriers for Veteran STEM Careers Veterans have given so much to our nation, and its important that we keep the promises made to them. One way we can help is in the transition from the military to civilian life. Its not always easy for members of our military to make a switch to a civilian career. This week, the House passed the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, legislation to boost veteran career opportunities in the STEM and computer science fields. Through educational opportunities, data-driven outreach initiatives, and traineeship programs, this piece of legislation will help to dismantle the current barriers our heroes face upon transitioning into a civilian career. Closing the Digital Divide I am proud to serve as the Republican Leader on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communication and Technology. One of my main priorities is closing the digital divide and increasing access to broadband  especially in our rural areas. Over the past few years, weve worked in Congress to help provide the tools to provide more Americans with high-speed Internet. Last week, a draft Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report showed that actions by the FCC and Congress are working. According to the draft report, the number of Americans lacking access to high-speed broadband has fallen by 25%. The majority of those Americans live in rural areas. Whats important about these facts is it shows efforts to reduce regulatory burdens and support investment are helping more Americans gain access to high-speed Internet. As I represent a number of rural areas, I know it will make a significant difference inside family homes and for businesses on Main Street in rural communities. Its important we keep this momentum going. Protecting Local Radio Our local radio stations in Northwest and West Central Ohio provide us with emergency alerts, important weather updates, and keep us in-the-know on the latest news. They are integral parts of our communities. However, various fee and royalty proposals in Congress have threatened the way that these radio stations are able to operate. This week, I cosponsored a bipartisan resolution, the Local Radio Freedom Act, which opposes any fees, taxes, and royalties on broadcasting performances for local radio stations. The Local Radio Freedom Act recognizes the potential damaging effects of fees and royalties and demonstrates the broad bipartisan support for local radio stations and their listeners across our country.  Time is Right for Data Privacy Legislation This week, I participated in an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing on data privacy issues. I talked about how the time is right to pass bipartisan federal privacy legislation. My opening statement is below, but you can watch the video of the hearing as well. I spoke at 1:46. Here's what I said: Last Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee held nearly a dozen hearings discussing privacy and security issues. That includes much publicized hearings where we heard from the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter about how those companies collect, safeguard, and use data. From those hearings, it was clear that while these companies provide a service that Americans like, consumers arent always clear about what happens with their personal information. With the California law slated to take effect at the beginning of next year, time is of the essence. In divided government, its not always easy to tackle the tough problems, but I believe the time is right to work together on a federal data privacy solution. Both consumer groups and business organizations have come on board in calling for a national standard. We all agree that consumers should have transparency and accountability, and that we want to ensure that the United States stays the prime location for innovation and technology. True Blue Award I was honored to receive the True Blue Award this week for my strong record supporting family values -100% on the 2018 Family Resource Council scorecard. In a week when the Senate voted down the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, its never been more important to stand up on these issues. These are the values of Ohios 5th Congressional District, and Ill continue to back policies that protect life, liberty, and religious freedom. Latta receiving the 'True Blue' Award from FRC President Tony Perkins Around the District Tours, Meetings, and Celebrations in Ohios 5th District Over the last few weeks, Ive made a number of stops to talk with people in communities around the district. In Mercer County, I had the pleasure of attending the Celina-Mercer Chamber of Commerce annual banquet. I also attended the Henry County Community Improvement Corporation's annual meeting and reception. This event serves as an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of those who have made a lasting impact in the area. In Lucas County, I toured K-Limited Carrier, a liquid bulk carrying company, where I was able to see their operations up close. In addition, I toured the West Suburban Animal Hospital where I was able to see how the 6 vets at the facility - and 22 in their system - help take care of pets and other animals. One of my favorite sayings is, If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. Needless to say, I have a soft spot for the men and women that provide treatment for our pets.  FFA Celebration in Wyandot County I attended a celebration of the 91st anniversary of Future Farmers of America at the Wyandot County Ag Leaders Breakfast. FFA is a tremendous organization that helps our youth prepare for careers in science, business, and agricultural technology. The breakfast was put on by the Ohio FFA chapters from Carey, Mohawk, Riverdale, and Upper Sandusky schools, and it was inspiring to see such great leadership from local FFA chapters in the region. Congressional Art Competition Reminder A reminder that the deadline for submission for this year's Congressional Art Competition is on Monday, March 4. That's TOMORROW! High school students that live or attend school in Ohios Fifth Congressional District are encouraged to submit a piece of art for this years competition. All artwork will be displayed at Owens Community College in Perrysburg Township. More than 650,000 high school students have participated in the competition nationwide since it began in 1982. The winning piece will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. for one year, and three honorable mention pieces will be displayed in my district offices. More information is available here. Defending the Most Innocent It was a dark day on Monday in the U.S. Senate as commonsense legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection, was defeated. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require that a baby who survives an attempted abortion be provided the exact same health care as a baby born prematurely. There is no justification for voting against this legislation. Its the morally right decision to pass this bill. Its backed by science. Its supported by nearly four out of every five Americans. Instead, 44 Democrats voted against the legislation and supported a position completely outside of the mainstream. I thank Democratic Senators Joe Manchin, Doug Jones, and Bob Casey for bucking their party on this important issue  but its disgraceful that they werent joined by more of their colleagues. Recently, I authored an op-ed on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the shocking comments made by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on the abortion issue. This comes after the state of New York passed extreme abortion legislation that would make late-term abortions much easier to obtain. Vermont is now working legislation that would go even farther. Its alarming. As a member of the Pro-Life Caucus, we will continue to call up this legislation in the House until we are given a vote. I wont stop standing up for the most innocent in our society. Protecting 2nd Amendment Rights This week, I voted against H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, bills attempting to roll back Americans Second Amendment rights. The bills contained numerous problems and would do little to prevent criminals from accessing firearms. For instance, providing a gun as a gift to a cousin or an in-law would be illegal under this bill. Also, while there was a hunting exception included, its so vague that it may criminalize sportsmen and sportswomen that are simply handing a firearm to their hunting partner. Weve previously passed legislation to fix and strengthen the NICS background check system, provide more resources to schools to address gun violence, and reform the mental health system  all steps to enforce the current laws on the books and keep guns out of the hands of criminals. The two bills that passed the House this week would not have stopped recent shootings, but they would criminalize the law-abiding gun owners that I represent. I voted no on both pieces of legislation. Enjoy your week and please don't hesitate to reach out to my office if I or my staff can be of service to you.

I also expressed disappointment at President Trump&#8217;s misleading address to the nation on the U.S.-Mexico border situation, co-sponsored a bill that would require universal background checks for gun purchases, voted to authorize the House to intervene in a federal lawsuit in a Texas case involving the Affordable Care Act, congratulated three new Memphis City Council members, wrote about my Constitutional amendment to eliminate the Electoral College, attended an event honoring former Congresswoman Gabby&nbsp;Giffords&nbsp;and the late Congressman Leo Ryan, offered 2019 Capitol Historical Society calendars and suggested a health tip for preventing sickness in pets. Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;to see more updates as they happen.  Voting to Re-open Departments Closed by Trump Shutdown  Reacting to Trump&#8217;s Border Wall &#8220;Crisis&#8221; Speech  Attending Event Honoring Gabby&nbsp;Giffords&nbsp;and the late Leo Ryan  Co-Sponsoring Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019  Authorizing the House to Intervene in Appeal of Texas ACA Case  Congratulating New City Council Members Greer, Johnson and Currie  Writing Opinion Article on Ending the Electoral College  Holding a District Issues Meeting on Friday  Offering U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars&nbsp;&nbsp; Signing Up for &#8220;Congress On Your Corner&#8221; and this e-Newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp; Weekly Health Tip  Quote of the Week     Voting to Re-open Departments Closed by Trump Shutdown  This week, the House took up and passed a series of bills -- drafted by Senate Republicans and passed overwhelmingly by the Senate last year -- in an effort to re-open the government and put federal workers back to work. See my releases on the subject&nbsp;here&nbsp;and&nbsp;here&nbsp;and&nbsp;here. As I write this, an intransigent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is refusing to bring the measures to the Senate floor for a vote, and the Trump shutdown continues. The costs of the shutdown are already extending beyond those directly affected and will pose increasing risks to the U.S. economy. Business confidence may weaken; consumer spending may slow; travel delays are starting to be seen at some airports; mortgage processing is threatened and the broader economy may be slowing.  Reacting to Trump&#8217;s Border Wall &#8220;Crisis&#8221; Speech  I watched President Trump&#8217;s first address to the nation from the Oval Office and was disappointed to hear the same misleading fearmongering and simplistic commentary. See my statement on the speech&nbsp;here.  Attending Event Honoring Gabby&nbsp;Giffords&nbsp;and the late Leo Ryan    On Wednesday, I attended the unveiling of a plaque naming the House Democratic Cloakroom in the U.S. Capitol for former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle&nbsp;Giffords&nbsp;and the late California Congressman Leo J. Ryan. Gabby was in my 2006 Congressional class and I was deeply troubled by the attack on her and her staff in January 2011 from which she is still recovering.&nbsp;Gabby&nbsp;is an active proponent for sensible gun policy and continues to advance good causes&nbsp;despite her continuing physical&nbsp;challenges.&nbsp;Ryan was a fighter for justice whose 1978 in-person fact-finding mission to the Peoples Temple cult in Johnstown, Guyana, led to his assassination. Ryan&#8217;s staffer Jackie Speier was seriously wounded in the incident but is now Congresswoman Speier after succeeding my friend and hero, the late Tom Lantos, in representing part of the Bay Area. As Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in unveiling the&nbsp;Giffords-Ryan plaque, &#8220;We inscribe their names in the halls of Congress as an enduring monument to their legacies of heroism and selflessness.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Co-Sponsoring Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019  Gun violence prevention is a high priority for the new Majority and I was pleased to join Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Mike Thompson and others on Tuesday in co-sponsoring a major initiative. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019&nbsp;(H.R. 8)&nbsp;would require background checks on all gun sales.&nbsp;Gabby&nbsp;Giffords, as a former member,&nbsp;was on the House floor when the bill was introduced.  Authorizing the House to Intervene in Appeal of Texas ACA Case  On Tuesday, I voted to authorize the House to intervene in the federal court case out of Texas in which a judge recently declared the Affordable Care Act (ACA) unconstitutional. The ACA provides affordable health insurance coverage to over 20 million people and ensures that insurers can no longer refuse coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions. I&nbsp;will continue to fight to see that protection preserved.&nbsp;  Congratulating New City Council Members Greer, Johnson and Currie    I send my congratulations to Southwest Tennessee Community College Administrator Sherman Greer, former Shelby County Assessor Cheyenne Johnson and Whitehaven Community Development Officer&nbsp;Gerre&nbsp;Currie for their appointments to the Memphis City Council this week. Sherman Greer was my first District Director and always put helping constituents first; Cheyenne Johnson has been a good friend for 40 years; and&nbsp;Gerre&nbsp;Currie&nbsp;is held in high esteem.&nbsp;It&#8217;s good to see the Council back to its full 13-member strength.  Writing Opinion Article on Ending the Electoral College  This Sunday,&nbsp;The&nbsp;Commercial Appeal will run an opinion article I wrote&nbsp;about&nbsp;a Constitutional amendment&nbsp;I introduced&nbsp;to eliminate the Electoral College,&nbsp;an&nbsp;institution that has&nbsp;resulted in five presidents taking office despite losing the popular vote.&nbsp;See my article&nbsp;here.

Members of Congress will now be held personally liable for all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment, and retaliation. And survivors will no longer be hindered by an obstacle-ridden dispute resolution process that had been stacked in favor of perpetrators and the institution in their pursuit of justice.  Ratifying the ERA &#150; Only One State Away!   To give women and girls the legal standing needed to fight harassment and discrimination at school, in the workplace, and in the military, we must pass my resolution to remove the deadline and allow for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution. With both Nevada&#8217;s and Illinois&#8217;s ratification of the ERA in 2017 and 2018 respectively, we are now just one state shy of achieving gender equality.  Alleviating Airport Noise   Airplane noise has become an ever-increasing concern in our communities due to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)&#8217;s implementation of the NextGen navigation program. The FAA Reauthorization Act, which passed in October 2018, included my provisions to require the FAA to undertake several new studies to research the economic and health impacts of airplane noise and new methods for alleviating airplane noise.&nbsp;  Fighting for Local Fishermen  I introduced H.R. 2344, the Crab Emergency Disaster Assistance Act, to assist the commercial fishermen and local businesses that were economically devastated by the closure of the Dungeness crab season in 2016 due to a toxic algae bloom. The bill would provide $117 million in critically-needed disaster relief funds to help these hard-working men and woman stay in business.  Stopping Incessant Robocalls  Although the FCC Chairman recently demanded that the phone industry adopt a call authentication system to combat illegal caller ID spoofing by next year, much more must be done to address the scourge of robocalls that result in over $350 million lost to phone scams each year. That is why I introduced H.R. 5573, the ROBOCOP (Repeated Objectionable Bothering of Consumers on Phones) Act, to require phone companies to provide customers with free tools to block robocalls.  Standing Against Family Separation    I led a delegation of my Democratic colleagues to visit Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration facilities and a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) child shelter in South Texas in June of 2018 to see firsthand the impact of the Trump Administration&#8217;s cruel &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy. I also called on DHS and HHS to address my concerns, demanded greater transparency about the treatment of detained families, and demanded that the Administration immediately reunite children who remain separated from their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Supporting Our Troops at The Border   I traveled to our southern border at Christmastime to visit troops deployed to Southern California by President Trump one week before the November elections. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and I sent a bicameral letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expressing grave concerns over the highly suspicious timing of sending 5,000 active duty military personnel to the region, which was described by the Pentagon as &#8220;an expensive waste of time and resources, and a morale killer to boot.&#8221; We have also questioned the extent of the Department of Defense resources that have been expended on this operation.  &nbsp; Allowing Our Furry Friends in the GGNRA   In 2017, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area finally dropped its flawed dog management plan, allowing dog owners to walk their pets off-leash as they have for decades. Next up, establishing an off-leash dog area in San Mateo County which has none.  Protecting Students from Sexual Harassment &amp; Violence  Over the past two years, President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have led a campaign to roll back Title IX protections and force survivors of sexual violence in schools and on college campuses back into the shadows. I have introduced H.R. 4030, the Title IX Protection Act, which codifies Obama-era Title IX guidance. I also introduced and H.R. 6464, the HALT Act, which goes beyond Title IX protections to strengthen prevention and enforcement efforts designed to combat campus sexual violence. I also led several letters to Secretary DeVos, the most recent of which urged her to abandon her dangerous proposal and instead meet with a broad range of survivor advocacy organizations to develop meaningful guidance to protect all students.  Protecting Transgender Servicemembers   President Trump announced his bigoted policy to ban new transgendered servicemembers in July 2017, with it taking effect in early 2018 and leaving many of our current servicemembers in limbo. In response to his attack on our brave troops, I introduced a bipartisan bill (H.R. 4041) to protect transgender members of the U.S. military by preventing the Department of Defense (DoD) from removing any currently serving members of the Armed Forces based solely on gender identity.  Ending the Shipping Ban on Alcohol   I introduced the bipartisan USPS Shipping Equity Act to end the Prohibition-era ban against shipping or delivering alcoholic beverages in compliance with the buyer&#8217;s state law. This bill would give consumers another option besides private shippers &#150; such as UPS and FedEx &#150; and would bring in $50 million of new revenue for our struggling USPS.  Halting Law Enforcement Abuse of Power   about a teenage girl who was raped by two police officers while in their custody exposed a since-closed loophole in New York state law that allowed the officers to argue the sex was consensual. That glaring legal technicality still exists in federal law enforcement and in 30 other states, which is why I introduced H.R. 6568, the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act. My bill makes it a crime for federal officers to have sexual encounters with anyone in their custody or who is being held under the color of law and provides incentives to the 30 remaining states to pass similar laws.  Addressing &#8220;Revenge Porn&#8221; in the Military   After hearing from numerous servicewomen who were attacked via websites and online groups like Marines United, which obtain and post obscene and abusive pictures, I was appalled to learn that the distribution of intimate photos without one&#8217;s consent was not clearly defined as illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. To address this injustice I introduced H.R. 2050 &#150; the PRIVATE Act &#150; which became law in December 2017, and explicitly prohibits the sharing of intimate images without consent.  Constituent Outreach  Town Hall Meetings   Over the last two years I have held 16 town halls throughout the 14th Congressional District. These meetings are invaluable for me to learn about your concerns and ideas. They also inspire me to keep fighting for your rights, protections, and freedoms in Washington, DC. Attendance has ranged from approximately 200 to 1,900 attendees &#150; the latter of which was both the largest town hall in my district and one of, if not THE largest in the country. I know the last two years have been trying, but your participation and passion has been crucial to our successes in the past Congress. I urge and encourage you to stay engaged and active. I will continue to hold town halls in 2019 and look forward to seeing you there.  Mail  Constituent outreach is an essential part of my job. I am grateful to represent a district filled with passionate people who are willing to share their thoughts on the issues that matter most. Over the course of the 115th Congress, my offices logged almost 125,000 letters, e-mails, phone calls, and faxes from constituents. I personally reviewed these logs and approved and signed every response. And I rely on the opinions and insights you share with me when weighing policy and other strategic decisions, so I look forward to hearing more from you in the 116th Congress!  ---  It&#8217;s my greatest privilege to serve as your Member of Congress and I look forward to continuing that service in the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives. Last year ended with a historic Pink Wave with the most women, including the most women of color, elected to serve in Congress. And I will work with the women and men of the 116th Congress to build on this incredible opportunity to advance progressive policies that benefit all Americans.  We have more work to do to hold the President and his Administration accountable for their incompetence and corruption, which is why I am introducing legislation to reform our ethics and campaign finance laws and promote greater transparency by requiring every candidate for the Office of President and Vice President to provide tax returns for the last 10 years to the public.  In my roles on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Armed Services Committee, I will continue to monitor the Russia investigation, make sure our servicemembers and their families have the support they need, and work to weed out waste, fraud, abuse.  I will also do everything I can to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at the American dream and that we can all give our children a better life by protecting the ACA and those with preexisting conditions, lowering drug prices, increasing access to health care, strengthening our nation's woefully inadequate gun safety laws, creating greater economic opportunities through the improvement of our nation&#8217;s infrastructure, and fixing our broken immigration system.  Finally, I will continue to champion women&#8217;s equality, LGBTQ rights, and the rights of the disenfranchised by taking my fight to eliminate harassment and discrimination in Congress to our schools, workplaces, and the military. That includes pushing for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution &#150; this is the year that we will finally declare victory!  I hope that the new year is filled with happiness, health, and success for you and your loved ones, and our country. It truly is an honor to represent you and I promise to continue my work to strengthen our democracy and secure a safe and prosperous future for generations to come.  All the best, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                    Washington, DC  2465 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-3531 Fax: (202) 226-4183  San Mateo Office  155 Bovet Road, Suite 780 San Mateo, CA 94402  Phone: (650) 342-0300 Fax: (650) 375-8270             Privacy Policy     p { margin-bottom:1em; } ","district":"12","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"CA","party":"Democrat","score":3.8761878},{"name":"Collin Peterson","address":"Subscriptions.MN07@MAIL.HOUSE.GOV","timestamp":"2018-11-16","subject":"Rep.

My constituents have long expressed the need for local management of gray wolves, and I urge the Senate to act on this quickly. On Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue visited my office to discuss issues for the House Agriculture Committee heading into the 116th Congress. I appreciate the good working relationship I have with Secretary Perdue and I look forward to working with him during the next Congress. I am continuing to negotiate the farm bill with my colleagues on the conference committee and I believe we are close to finishing our report. I remain confident we will have a 5-year farm bill enacted by the end of the year. Sincerely, [cid:image003.png@01D47DD1.99D818A0] Congressman Collin C. Peterson Minnesota 7th District Manage Our Wolves Act [cid:image038.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] I voted in support of a bill that includes my language to delist gray wolves in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Wyoming. This morning, the Manage our Wolves Act passed the House on a bipartisan 196-180 vote and moves across the Capitol for Senate action. Farmers and ranchers in rural Minnesota need to be able to protect their livestock and pets from predatory gray wolves that are constantly stalking herds across the state. This scheduled vote followed a letter written by a coalition of 19 agriculture and sportsmen's organizations that urged Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to place my bill on the House floor for a vote before the year's end. I gave a speech in support of this bill on the House floor. You can watch video of my speech by clicking here. Farm bill I would like to be able to tell you in this newsletter that we have a farm bill conference report drafted and ready for conferees to sign, but we're not quite there yet. However, we are finally in striking distance of an agreement. We have narrowed issues down and I have worked with Chairman Conaway on a House offer that has been presented to the Senate to help us close out remaining issues. We are still focused on the goal of getting a new farm bill passed before the end of year to bring certainty to our ag producers and rural communities. Secretary Sonny Perdue [cid:image039.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stopped my office to congratulate me on my reelection after we chatted on election night. We discussed the status of the farm bill, the Trump Administration's rulemaking on SNAP waivers, and the agenda for the House Agriculture Committee in the upcoming congress. I appreciate the good working relationship I have developed with Secretary Perdue since his appointment and look forward to working with him on the issues facing our farmers and rural America. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall [cid:image040.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] I spoke with American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall on Friday. We discussed the ongoing farm bill negotiations and the importance of enacting a 5-year bill by the end of the year. Zippy and I agree that American producers depend on a 5-year bill to increase certainty for them at this time when environmental and financial stresses have a lot of folks concerned about the future. New Flyer [cid:image041.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] This week, representatives of New Flyer visited my office to thank me for my efforts to keep U.S. bus manufacturers competitive. I recently joined a letter urging the Department of Transportation to clarify its \"Buy America\" regulations to ensure that manufacturers, like New Flyer's plant in Crookston, can properly project costs, procure parts, and avoid disruptions to transit systems. I also thanked Wayne Joseph (President of Transit Bus Business - pictured far left) and Paul Smith (Executive Vice President - pictured far right) for their decades of advocacy as they look forward to retirement at the end of the year. White Earth Tribal Council [cid:image042.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Raymond Auginaush, Sr., Alan Roy, and Eugene Tibbetts Recently elected members of the White Earth Tribal Council visited with me to discuss the tribe's wild rice cultivation efforts and the farm bill. White Earth Nation grows and harvests significant amounts of wild rice by hand that is high in protein and dietary fiber. I look forward to working with White Earth to expand market access for their wild rice. Stronger America Through Seafood [cid:image043.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] I am the lead Democrat on the AQUAA Act, a bill which streamlines federal permitting processes for aquaculture facilities in federal waters and creates research and development opportunities to expand domestic markets of American-grown shrimp and fish. A coalition of seafood, restaurant, and manufacturing groups knowns as Stronger America Through Seafood (SATS) visited with me to show their support for the bill which will also benefit Minnesota-based aquaculture facilities. National Young Farmers Coalition [cid:image044.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Sophie Vranian (Watertown), Sam Karns (Duluth), Starr Brainerd (Duluth), Andrew Bahrenburg, Aimee Haag (LITCHFIELD), Lindsay Lusher Shute On Thursday, representatives of the National Young Farmers Coalition visited my office to talk about the farm bill and federal programs for young and beginning farmers. During farm bill negotiations I have supported the increase of funding for the Beginning Farmers and Rancher Development Program, a program that provides financial and educational resources for young farmers. We also discussed what the House Agriculture Committee could look like during the 116th Congress. I hope to recruit members from the incoming class of representatives that are dedicated to learning the details of federal agriculture policy, so that Congress can effectively serve Americas producers. Teamsters [cid:image045.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] This week, I met with representatives of the Teamsters to discuss the issues affecting pensions across the nation. Congress must work to protect the hard-earned dollars American workers have invested over the years for their retirements. I signed onto the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, also known as the Butch Lewis Act in the Senate, so we can keep these funds from insolvency. It is time for the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to move legislation that addresses this problem, and I will continue to work with my friends on both sides of the aisle to see this through. Additionally, some members of the group were Vietnam War veterans, and I was honored to present them with Vietnam War Commemoration Lapel Pins to recognize their service. Beth Ford [cid:image046.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Katie Zenk, Beth Ford, Adam Durand Beth Ford, Land O'Lakes new CEO visited my office on Thursday. She talked about the importance of completing the farm bill for dairy producers in Minnesota as well as the need to make progress on other issues like immigration reform and resolving ongoing trade disputes. I have worked on a bipartisan basis on each of these issues and will continue to do so to strengthen our rural economy. Energy Conservation Improvement Programs [cid:image022.png@01D47DD1.99D818A0] In 1980, the Public Utilities Commission was directed to initiate a pilot program to demonstrate the feasibility of investments in energy efficiency. Four decades later, Minnesota has a host of Conservation Improvement Programs, Clean Energy Resource Teams and a statewide Energy Savings Platform for communities. Minnesota now ranks 8th in the National Energy Efficiency Scorecard. Since 2008, the Conservation Improvement Program has saved Minnesotans an estimated $3.5 billion on their energy bills. Find more information about Minnesota's energy-saving initiatives here. Veterans Day Lapel Pin [cid:image023.jpg@01D47DD1.99D818A0] Department of Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary Melissa Glynn presented me with a Veterans Day Lapel Pin, which is given to Congressional Members that are also veterans. I served in the North Dakota National Guard from 1963 to 1969 and honored to have received this recognition. Welcome Madeleine! [cid:image047.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] My office welcomed Minnesota native Madeleine Lerner this week. Madeleine graduated from the University of Minnesota, Morris in 2017 and has her Master's in Conflict Transformation and Social Justice from Queen's University Belfast. She will be interning in D.C. through the end of the year and helping serve the folks of the 7th District. I am happy to be able to give students interested in government an up-close view of the legislative process. Spring Internship Application Deadline Approaches I highly encourage all college students and recent graduates interested in serving Minnesota's 7th district to apply to intern in my Washington, D.C. office. The deadline for submitting applications for spring 2019 internships is November 27, 2018.

Thanksgiving Dinner Cost Drops for 3rd Straight Year [cid:image048.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] The American Farm Bureau Federation conducts an annual survey on the cost of classic holiday food products. The annual survey shows that the average cost of a Thanksgiving dinner is down 22 cents per person this year. In a similar trend, the price of your Thanksgiving turkey is about $1.36 per pound cheaper than it was last year - down 3 percent. Milk, sweet potatoes, green peas, and rolls also dropped in price. The Farm Bureau concludes that, after inflation, the average price of this year's Thanksgiving dinner is $19.37, the cheapest it has been in more than a decade. Minnesota Ranks #2 for Volunteering in the U.S. [cid:image049.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] The Corporation for National and Community Service recently released a ranking of states based on the volunteering and civic engagement of residents. Minnesota was ranked #2 among states and Minneapolis and St. Paul together are the #1 cities. These volunteer activities provided an estimated $3.3 billion in economic value to Minnesota. We should be proud of our state's commitment to service, and I hope that folks continue to offer what time they can for volunteering in their communities.

Hurricane Michael is picking up speed and strength as it approaches the Gulf Coast, and it has the potential to affect Georgians. I urge all Georgians to be vigilant, stay updated and heed the advice of state and local officials and please take advantage of this window of time and the many available resources to prepare. I will be working closely with Governor Deal, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the storm approaches landfall.

Selling any sort of human body part for profit is prohibited by federal law. We must ensure that our government engages in research that is ethical, and because of this, I led a Congressional inquiry (and was joined by 85 of my colleagues) into the FDA&#8217;s contract with this company. I also spoke personally with Health &amp; Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about my concerns that research dollars were being used illegally and that this funding should go to alternative forms of research that advance cures and are life-affirming. &nbsp;  I&#8217;m pleased to announce that following my conversation, Secretary Azar publicly stated the FDA would cancel its contract with Advanced Biomedical Resources and HHS would conduct an agency-wide review of all research involving human fetal tissue and will explore alternative options. I&#8217;m thankful HHS is taking steps to make sure its research meets the highest of ethical standards, &nbsp;We need to find cures without devaluing or destroying human life.     Leveling the Playing Field with Canada, Creating a New NAFTA     This is an important week in America&#8217;s trade dealings with its neighbors. On Sunday night, Canada agreed to join the United States and Mexico in a deal to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico previously agreed to a new arrangement with the United States, but Canada had not come to the table until this week. &nbsp;  The United States and Canada have long been friendly trading partners. In recent years however, Canada has not been dealing on a level playing field with our country. For instance, Canada had imposed a 241 percent tariff on American fluid milk while the U.S. imposed NO tariff on Canadian liquid milk. Thankfully, Canada is willing to negotiate this trade imbalance. Free trade must be fair trade &#150; for the three countries involved in the new agreement. &nbsp;  I have been a vocal advocate for finalizing fair trade deals in an expeditious manner and am pleased with the priority the Trump Administration has given to getting good deals for the American people. I look forward to studying this agreement further and appreciate the President fighting for American interests across the world stage.     What&#8217;s the Hold Up?   In this Congress, we&#8217;re still waiting for important federal nominees to be confirmed. We still have unfilled positions throughout the government and multiple district judges who have yet to be confirmed. In fact, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees of the past four Administrations. Even Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) stated, &#8220;Enough is enough. We need people who are qualified to filled these important positions in our government.&#8221; I agree. It&#8217;s time for the Senate to finish confirming these important positions.     Missouri Task Force 1 Heroes Come Home     Missouri Task Force 1 comes to the aid of a vehicle in Brunswick County, NC, in the wake of Hurricane Florence.  The Boone County Fire District&#8217;s Missouri Task Force 1 has returned home after yet another successful operation protecting Americans in the wake of natural disaster. Task Force 1 got back to Columbia on Saturday after two weeks of searching for and rescuing victims of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina. During its mission, the task force rescued and evacuated 394 residents and 33 pets. In addition, the teams provided wellness checks on 1,374 residents who remained in their homes and provided assistance to 155 residents. The teams also performed damage assessments on 381 structures. I am so proud of their hard work.  &nbsp;  How Tax Reform is Working for You The tax reform package passed almost a year ago continues to bear fruit. AP reports a Kentucky-based home appliances business plans to add 400 jobs as part of a $200 million investment to expand production at its Louisville operation. Since May, GE Appliances has announced more than $475 million of investment in products, manufacturing, and distribution. GE Appliances President and CEO Kevin Nolan said the tax package played &#8220;a big role&#8221; in the company&#8217;s expansion plans.    There is no doubt that tax reform is still providing wonderful benefits for hard-working Americans.  &nbsp; Weekly Dose of Good News Confidence and optimism create success &#150; and Americans are experiencing a sense of confidence not seen in a long time. In September, the Conference Board&#8217;s measurement of Americans&#8217; confidence reached its highest level in 18 years.    Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board, points to a couple of very strong reasons for that confidence: &#8220;Consumers&#8217; assessment of current conditions remains extremely favorable, bolstered by a strong economy and robust job growth &#133; These historically high confidence levels should continue to support healthy consumer spending, and should be welcome news for retailers as they begin gearing up for the holiday season.&#8221; &nbsp; #DrugFreeMO               &nbsp; Yours in service,  Vicky Hartzler Member of Congress    &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;    Forward to a Friend &nbsp;Contact Me Here     &nbsp; Join the Conversation:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                    Washington, DC  2235 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-2876 Fax: (202) 225-0148    Harrisonville Office  1909 N.

I was shocked by the damage in Dauphin County by the storms this summer.    Last year, eight percent of the U.S. population was affected by at least one disaster &#150; that&#8217;s 26.4 million Americans.&nbsp; In fact, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria became three of our country&#8217;s five most expensive hurricanes on record, causing a combined $265 billion in damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we&#8217;ve already seen disaster strike in our own communities, as more than 20 counties in Pennsylvania were devastated by widespread flooding in July and August.&nbsp; Pennsylvania&#8217;s 11th District is no stranger to flooding, but the storms we saw over the summer were truly devastating, destroying homes, memories, and lives. And, at this moment, the Carolinas continue to recover from Hurricane Florence, which took the lives of over 40 Americans.&nbsp; It could not be clearer: America needs a better system that saves lives and taxpayer dollars by building smarter and stronger before disaster strikes, which is exactly what&nbsp;DRRA&nbsp;does. DRRA is a bipartisan bill that&nbsp;implements broad reforms at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, increasing the federal emphasis on pre-disaster planning and mitigation, which will reduce the potential for future loss of life and address the rising costs of disasters throughout America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigation can encompass a wide variety of activities, including proactive preparation and planning, elevating or moving structures prone to flooding, and hardening structures to mitigate effects of hurricanes or earthquakes.&nbsp; Local infrastructure projects like the flood wall in Bloomsburg demonstrate how investment made before disaster strikes is critical to saving lives and taxpayer dollars.  DRRA also includes provisions ranging from ensuring that individuals with disabilities are able to repair or replace accessibility related property to ensuring pets and other animals are taken care of during disasters.  Since introducing this bill last November, I have worked tirelessly to ensure these critical reforms are signed into law. &nbsp;I urge the Senate to follow the House&#8217;s lead to protect communities across the country, and send this important legislation to the president&#8217;s desk.

On Friday, I attended the funeral honoring this dedicated, brave public servant, who saved the lives of at least two innocent bystanders. Sheriff&#8217;s Deupty Kunze had been part of law enforcement for 18 years &#150; six with the Shawnee County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, and the last 12 years in south central Kansas. Sedgwick County Sheriff Jeff Easter shared that Officer Kunze will be remembered for &#8220;his smile, his contagious laugh and his ability to engage anyone and everyone in a conversation.&#8221; Robba and I ask Kansans to join us in praying for Robert&#8217;s wife and daughter. May God comfort them in their time of grief and be a source of strength for them, and may He protect those who put their life on the line every day to keep our communities safe.&nbsp;  Advocating for USDA Jobs in Kansas  Following the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s (USDA) announcement in August that it would move the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) away from Washington, D.C. and closer to stakeholders and qualified staff; this week, I further explained to Ag Secretary Sonny Purdue why Kansas would make an excellent home for both organizations and the men and women who comprise them.  Kansas is home to a highly-skilled workforce as a result of the state&#8217;s premier universities, research institutions, agricultural companies and industry producer groups. The animal health corridor, stretching from Manhattan, Kan. to Columbia, Mo., has the largest concentration of animal health companies in the world. As of 2014, 56 percent of worldwide animal health, diagnostics and pet food sales were located within the corridor.  The concentration of animal health companies and esteemed research institutions will not only complement the research capabilities of NIFA and ERS, but have also fostered a talented workforce that will help meet the personnel needs of USDA.

Encouraging National Online Privacy Protections On Thursday, I led a group of my Senate colleagues in encouraging U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to include Congress in any blueprint discussions regarding a national data privacy framework. It is essential to protect Americans from data misuse while also establishing certainty for businesses to create jobs, innovate and compete domestically and internationally. The only way to accomplish this goal is to create a national data privacy framework.  Any proposal that satisfies both the needs of the American consumers and the internet economy should include the input of Congress, as it would require Congressional action to create an enforceable standard nationwide. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I am ready to work with the Department of Commerce and my colleagues in Congress to provide Americans with data protections that promote privacy, competition and innovation.

Meeting with Senior Army Leaders on Environmental Safety On Tuesday in my Washington office, I met with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jordan Gillis, Brigadier General Joy Curriera and other Army leaders to discuss environmental safety at both Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth and the ongoing remediation of the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant site in Johnson County. I had previously questioned Army Secretary Mark Esper regarding the long-term clean-up efforts of the Sunflower site and this meeting was a productive discussion to help make certain progress remains on schedule for future land development. In addition to the Sunflower site, I also sought assurances that the Army is taking the necessary steps to protect the health and well-being of military families and children assigned to installations in Kansas. &nbsp;  Spending Time at the Boys and Girls Club of Lawrence  I visited with the Boys and Girls Club of Lawrence and toured their new facility, the Don and Beverly Gardner Center for Great Futures, which opened to club members earlier this month. During my visit with staff and board members, we discussed their efforts to serve area youth by promoting academic success, good character, citizenship and healthy lifestyles. We also discussed the organization&#8217;s close partnership with the Lawrence school district, and their advantageous co-location with the Peaslee Technical Training Center and the district&#8217;s Lawrence College and Career Center. Through experiences in organizations like the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, our state&#8217;s and country&#8217;s next generation of leaders are being equipped with the skills and values necessary to reach their full potential and find success. Thanks to CEO Colby Wilson and staff member Megan Hill for hosting me. A special thanks to Boys and Girls Club member, Eddieona, for leading my tour. &nbsp;  Addressing the Beloit Lions Club I visited the Beloit Lions Club for its meeting at North Central Technical College. I appreciate the Beloit Lions Club for allowing me to meet with the group and helping me make up one of my many Lions Club meeting absences from my home club in Hays. Our local communities are well-served by the support of Lions Club members. During my remarks, I reiterated my commitment to preserving communities like Beloit and Mitchell County for the next generation, and updated the group on work I&#8217;m doing on Kansans&#8217; behalf in Washington. I appreciate the many questions that were raised and value the comments and suggestions offered by Lions Club members and their guests. &nbsp;  Discussing Healthcare at Kansas Hospitals Newton Medical Center In Newton, I toured Newton Medical Center, a 103-bed facility that serves the residents of Harvey County and the surrounding area. On our tour, I visited with a number of healthcare providers to talk about current issues in healthcare and the challenges they face every day in caring for Kansans. I appreciate being able to visit these professionals in their facilities, where I can see the impact that a number of decisions we make in Washington have on their work. On the tour, I was pleased to visit different areas of the facility&nbsp;&#150; including the emergency department, the wound and hyperbaric center and the lab. In the emergency department, visited the new satellite office for the Newton Police Department. This innovative office helps improve the link between healthcare professionals and police officers to mitigate violence and conflict in the hospital. Thank you to Newton Medical Center CEO Vallerie Gleason for leading the tour and to Kansas Hospital Association CEO Tom Bell,&nbsp;Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy and Newton City Manager Bob Myers for joining my visit. Click here to read more about my visit in The Newton Kansan.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Smith County Memorial Hospital I visited Smith County Memorial Hospital, just over a month after the grand opening of its new facility. I enjoyed touring the new, state-of the art hospital and hearing from healthcare providers, hospital leadership and community stakeholders. Rural healthcare facilities face many challenges as they work to provide care for those in our state. I appreciated hearing firsthand from these individuals about how I can assist them as they continue to serve Kansans in a way that benefits both patients and providers. Thank you to Smith County Memorial Hospital CEO Allen Van Driel for leading our tour and to various hospital and community leaders for joining us, including; Smith Center Economic Development Director Stacy Schulte, Smith County Commissioner Art Befort, Smith Center Chamber of Commerce Member Lori Bortz, Smith County Memorial Hospital Board of Trustees Member Bret Strine, QUALICB Board Member &amp; GPHA Board Member John Terrill, and Smith Center Economic Development Board Member Kaden Roush. &nbsp;  Continuing my Kansas Listening Tour After this week&#8217;s townhall meetings, I have now held 101 townhalls this Congress and 1,308 total since I was first elected to Congress. I look forward to visiting with many Kansans in the coming weeks during the next leg of my Kanas Listening Tour.  Kingman County Thanks to the many Kingman County residents who took time to visit with me in Norwich, and to Brian Lichlier for opening up the Alamo community meeting building, where attendees came to discuss national security, healthcare and health insurance, trade and tariffs, immigration, the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal, education and student debt.  Thanks to Norwich Mayor Jerry Power for his introduction and welcome. It was nice to see the Norwich High School senior government class at the townhall, as well.  &nbsp; Harper County I visited Anthony in Harper County as part of my Kansas Listening Tour, where I had the chance to visit with local residents about current issues and the work I&#8217;m doing in the Senate, including immigration, the need for vocational education, the lack of bipartisanship in Congress and the need for decorum, and water conservation efforts.  Thank you to the Anthony Kiwanis Club for opening up their meeting to allow the public join in on the townhall and to Mayor Greg Cleveland for attending.  &nbsp; Barber County Next, I visited Medicine Lodge, where I visited with community members, business owners, and local and county leaders. Thanks to the many individuals who took time to visit with me, including those at the County Clerk&#8217;s Office, the County Treasurer&#8217;s Office, the Register of Deeds, the People&#8217;s Bank, Hibbard&#8217;s Health Mart, Lincoln Library, USD 254 and the USDA Service Center.  Pratt County I appreciate the many folks in Pratt County who attended my townhall meeting to talk about current issues important to Kansas and our nation. Our discussion included a number of topics, particularly on the importance of supporting vocational and technical education. Additionally, we spoke about protecting agriculture and the rural way of life, I heard concerns about water conservation and groundwater management, as well as ongoing trade disputes, tariffs, and the need for broadband in rural Kansas. Thanks to Pratt Community College (PCC) for hosting my visit and to PCC President Dr. Michael Calvert for sharing an update on current activity at PCC and for attending my townhall meeting.    Marion County I concluded this series of townhalls in Marion on Saturday, where I had the chance to visit with local residents about a number of items including access to rural broadband, education and folks&#8217; desire to keep important decision-making on the local and state level. We also discussed challenges facing our farmers and ranchers, especially that of mental health and suicide, veterans' healthcare and the VA MISSION Act, military preparedness, the SCOTUS nomination and issues in healthcare. Individuals were interested in discussing the ongoing trade and tariff issues and echoed the negative effects it is having on our agricultural and manufacturing industries. I appreciate the many residents who took time to attend my townhall meeting and I also thank Marion Mayor Todd Heitschmidt, former Hillsboro Mayor Delores Dalke and former State Representative Bob Brookens for attending my meeting.   Touring Farrar Corporation Foundry in Norwich Following my townhall meeting in Norwich, I visited Farrar Corporation's Foundry. Farrar is a family-owned business that is currently in its third generation of ownership. Over the years, Farrar has become nationally recognized for providing specialized finish machined products, as well as ductile iron castings and assemblies, and the company supports numerous Kansas jobs through its operations in both Norwich and Manhattan. Special thanks to CEO Joe Farrar for my tour and to various employees for hosting me on Thursday. Thanks also to Norwich Mayor Jerry Power for joining our tour. &nbsp;      Hosting Service Academy Interview and Selection Day On Saturday, I hosted my annual U.S. Service Academy Interview Day in Abilene. Throughout the day, prospective candidates interviewed with my Service Academy Selection Board, who will submit recommendations on who I should nominate to the United States Service Academies. These include the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  Service Academy Interview Day has consistently been one of my favorites, and the responsibility of nominating young men and women to our nation&#8217;s service academies is a task I take very seriously. The individuals we interview represent some of the best, brightest and most dedicated young people our state has to offer. Their willingness and desire to serve our country and attend such rigorous institutions is inspiring and makes me optimistic for the future of our country.  If nominated, applicants must then meet the individual admission requirements of each academy. The academies will make the final decision on who will receive an appointment of admission in early 2019. Those selected will enter the academies in June 2019.  Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an&nbsp;internship&nbsp;for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an&nbsp;intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have&nbsp;interns&nbsp;year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for&nbsp;internships&nbsp;in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for Spring 2018 are due Friday, October 19. Congressional&nbsp;internships&nbsp;are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence.&nbsp;Click here&nbsp;for more information.

First, new Census Data just released shows that in 2017, the median household income reached an all-time high. I believe that when things are good for middle-class families, theyre good for America. Were still seeing our economy growing, but the fact that incomes and wages are rising is a positive sign. In addition, a recent survey of small business owners found optimism at an all-time high. Small businesses are responsible for creating 2 out of every 3 new jobs so when they are raising wages, growing their businesses, and investing in equipment, its helpful to the entire economy. Another big piece of news was that the United States has passed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the worlds largest producer of oil thanks to the pro-energy policies that have been put in place. When we produce our own energy, it means lower costs for Ohioans, a stronger economy, and keeping more of our dollars at home. Energy independence also means a safer United States as we dont have to rely on Middle East Countries or Russia to meet our energy needs. An update on recent happenings: In Congress Freezing Congressional Pay Last week, I helped pass legislation that maintains a Congressional pay freeze that has been in place since 2010. Many people dont realize it, but under current law, Members of Congress receive a raise unless they specifically vote to freeze their own pay. I have long been critical of this policy. If Members of Congress want a raise, they should have to vote for it and explain why to their constituents. Ive authored legislation to put an end to the automatic pay increase. However, without my legislation being signed into law, Congress has to vote to freeze pay every year. Thats why I voted to pass the Conference Report for H.R. 5895 to guarantee no raise this year for Congress. The Bill also included a 10% reduction for House budgets that has been in place since 2010. Increasing Resources for the VA Included in the appropriations legislation I just mentioned were provisions to increase resources for the VA, military construction, and energy and water infrastructure. For example, $1.75 billion will go to implementing programs under the recently passed VA MISSION Act -- important legislation that will expand health care access for veterans in Ohio and around the country. The appropriations bill also expands Congressional Fellowships for the wounded veterans on Capitol Hill. It also funds mental health services, suicide prevention outreach, opioid abuse prevention, and rural health initiatives for our nations veterans. The bill now heads to the Presidents desk to be signed into law. Questioning Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I recently questioned CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, at a committee hearing about the social media platform. Twitter has recently come under fire for allegations of censoring conservative points of view. I asked Mr. Dorsey about the twitter verification process and how they ensure that they dont highlight one political view over another. Dorsey answered that they have halted the blue check mark process because of too many faults in the program. You can watch my questions here. Improving Student Loan Counseling, Increasing Information Available to Borrowers Students often take out loans of tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands, in order to graduate from college. Currently, more than $1.4 trillion of student debt is held by Americans. Most students are signing up for these loans as young adults and making decisions that can impact their financial well-being for years to come. I voted to pass the Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act which would enhance counseling for recipients of Federal financial aid. While financial counseling is required for students when they receive a student loan, more than 40% cannot recall receiving it. The bill would require annual loan counseling and would tailor the counseling to the borrowers individual situation. That includes making sure all available grant, work-study, and scholarship assistance options are exhausted before additional loans would be taken out. This legislation will help ensure financial counseling is more informative, so students can fully understand the financial implications of the student loans they are receiving and learn of alternatives that can help them pay for college. Care Packages for Spouses of Deployed Military Members I spent some time recently helping the USO on Capitol Hill assemble care packages for the spouses of deployed military members. When there is a deployment, it affects entire families, and we thank military spouses for their sacrifice. The USO does tremendous work to support our troops -- and their families -- and I was glad I was able to join them to lend a hand in putting together these care packages. Friend of Pets Award Pets are an integral part of our families, and theyre some of the best friends we can have. Thats why I was honored to receive the Friend of Pets award recently at an Animal Health Institute event. While I was there I met some good dogs like Max and Kirby (pictured at the bottom). Kirby is training to be a hero dog - a service dog for veterans. It was also great to chat with Brent Weinmann of Wood Countys Vitrakraft Sun Seed. Out and About in Hicksville I made a few stops in Hicksville in Defiance County recently including speaking at the Hicksville Rotary about the booming economy, tax cuts, and efforts to combat the opioid crisis. I also presented a flag in honor of Community Memorial Hospital to CEO Michelle Waggoner in honor of the hospital's 65th anniversary. Fairs, Fair, Fairs Nothing says Northwest Ohio like fair season, and I always appreciate being able to get to fairs in Ohio's 5th District. Its a great opportunity to talk to people, see the exhibits, and maybe enjoy a milkshake (or two). Just in the past couple of weeks Ive made it to the Williams, Van Wert, Fulton, Hancock, Hardin, and Wyandot County Fairs to name a few. At the Williams County Fair, Marcia and I enjoyed seeing the 4H 100th anniversary displays. On that note, congratulations to our nephew, Amos Sloan, for his 4H Grand Champion Steer he showed at the Williams County Fair. Hancock County Farm Bureau ATV Tour I participated recently in the Hancock County Farm Bureau ATV Tour - a great event to help the public learn about the ag industry. Part of the tour discussed the impact of Precision Agriculture. Ive authored legislation to expand access to rural broadband so more farmers can use this technology that is safer, more efficient, and good for the environment. The tour ended with lunch back at the Legacy Coop in McComb where I discussed some of my efforts to support agriculture. Thank you to our farmers for all you do to feed Ohio, the U.S., and the world. Latta-authored Clean Water Provisions Clear the House Provisions I authored to help public water systems improve infrastructure and ensure safer drinking water were approved by the House last week. The policies were included in the Water Resource Development Act (WRDA) which passed by voice vote. The provisions would:  Provide increased flexibility for the repayment of federal loans for states and local communities that use the funds to finance clean drinking water infrastructure projects  Cut burdensome red tape by removing duplicative reporting and paperwork requirements when state standards are equally stringent  or more so  than federal standards  Help disadvantaged communities better finance their infrastructure through the use of federal funding There are more than 51,000 community water systems across the country, all with varying needs and infrastructure currently in place. The inclusion of these clean drinking water provisions in WRDA will help communities  including disadvantaged ones  fix and improve their water infrastructure without burdening ratepayers with skyrocketing costs. By removing duplicative federal requirements and providing more flexibility to repay Federal loans, states and local governments will be better able to fund clean drinking water projects that meet their specific needs. Latta recognized as a Hero of Main Street I was honored to be recognized recently as a Hero of Main Street by the National Retail Federation (NRF) for my support of policies important to millions of small businesses in retail. More than 98 percent of all retail companies employ fewer than 50 people, and I have a 100% record on the NRF scorecard. That includes voting to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has resulted in small business confidence reaching all-time highs. In addition, I supported the Small Business Health Fairness Act to allow small businesses to band together to purchase health insurance plans for their employees. The retail industry is uniquely made up of small businesses that provide employment for tens of millions of Americans. Supporting policies that allow these businesses to grow means more jobs and higher wages for workers. Were seeing small business confidence at an all-time high, GDP growth at 4.2% last quarter, and unemployment matching the lowest rate in nearly 50 years because of these pro-growth policies. Retail is the nations largest private-sector employer, supporting one in four U.S. jobs  42 million working Americans. Contributing $2.6 trillion to annual GDP, retail is a daily barometer for the nations economy.

According to the well-respected Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the measure would cost some $3 trillion over the coming decade.  And make no mistake &#150; Republicans have made clear all along that Social Security and Medicare, along with Medicaid, will be put on the chopping block to pay the bill. Instead of putting a stop to endless wars of choice projected to cost nearly&nbsp;$16 trillion over the coming years, the GOP will attempt to finance their tax cuts for the wealthy by &#8220;privatizing&#8221; Social Security and Medicare, robbing benefits Americans have earned and paid into from their very first day on the job.  Simply put, Republican leaders have done the math. They are targeting Social Security and Medicare because these absolutely critical funds, which belong solely to the American people, account for about a quarter of the government&#8217;s $4.1 trillion annual budget. The deficits caused by last year&#8217;s GOP tax cut, which gave 80% of tax relief to the richest one-percent of Americans and left the middle class with a tiny fraction of the remainder, are already unsustainable. According to the independent Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the government spent $895 billion more than it took in over the past 11 months.&nbsp;  Here&#8217;s the bottom line. Billionaires and rich multinational corporations do not need another massive Republican tax cut that would add trillions of dollars to an already unsustainable deficit and be paid for by raiding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. It&#8217;s time for real tax reform that targets the middle class and requires the rich to pay their fair share. That must be our goal going forward.   We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.  Sincerely,     Ignoring Hurricane Season, President \"Reprogrammed\" $37.8 Million from FEMA and the Coast Guard to Build More Immigrant Family Jails&nbsp;&nbsp;   Men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard risk their lives every day to serve and protect others - but the President cut their funding by $28 million to build more immigrant child detention facilities on our southern border.&nbsp; Unable to generate legitimate Congressional support to fund more immigrant child detention centers on the southern border, the President decided to reach through the back door and grab $9.8 million in cash from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) &#150; the department in charge of hurricane relief. And to add insult to injury he pulled another $28 million out of the budget for the U.S. Coast Guard.&nbsp;  That&#8217;s right. With Hurricane Florence bearing down on the East Coast last week and millions of Americans at risk, reports surfaced that the President had &#8220;reprogrammed&#8221; $9.8 million dollars Congress had appropriated for FEMA, and used it to put more immigrant children and families behind bars.&nbsp; To be clear, it is Congress &#150; not the President &#150; in charge of appropriating money for federal agencies. Accordingly, I have asked Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney for a full explanation and justification for the President&#8217;s action. In fact, the $9.8 million taken from FEMA is only the tip of the iceberg. All in all, the President&#8217;s raid on programs and services vital to the American people totaled $169 million &#150; including $28 million in funds for the U.S. Coast Guard &#150; presumably sent to the border to build more jails.  From the Great Lakes to the hurricane ravaged East Coast, the brave men and women of the Coast Guard are risking their lives every day to save and protect others &#150; and the President&#8217;s response is to cut their funding by $28 million. That is a&nbsp;shameful and outrageous act by their Commander and Chief.&nbsp;   Another Record Year for the Port of  Duluth-Superior&nbsp;&nbsp;   The Port of Duluth-Superior enjoyed another record year in 2017, handling some 35 million tons of cargo arriving and departing on laker ships like the Mesabi Miner.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hats off to the Port of Duluth-Superior and the Duluth-Superior Seaway Port Authority for another record year contributing to the economic success of our entire region. According to a report just released by the Authority, the Port last year:   Generated $1.4 billion in economic activity. &nbsp; Supported 7,881 good paying jobs and $504 million in wages.   Handled 35 million tons of cargo &#150; including iron ore, coal, limestone, salt, cement, grain, steel wind turbines and heavy machinery &#150; moving in and out. &nbsp; Paid nearly $240 million in taxes.  The Port of Duluth-Superior anchors the westernmost point of the entire 2,340-mile Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway system that connects Minnesota&#8217;s mines, businesses, manufacturers, farmers and timber producers with the global marketplace.&nbsp;   It's Time to Restore Our Democracy - And End Voter Suppression&nbsp;   Billboards like this one, typically placed in neighborhoods with large minority populations, are intended to intimidate legal voters into staying home.  Democracy works best when people participate, so our Restore Democracy legislation calls for an end to voter suppression efforts that discourage, threaten or intimidate legal voters from casting their ballots. The simple fact is that despite protections provided by the Voting Rights Act and other federal legislation, some states continue to find ways to make voting difficult if not impossible &#150; especially for&nbsp;seniors and people of color who may be perceived to favor one political party over another. For example:   Georgia recently passed an &#8220;Exact Match&#8221; law requiring that every tiny bit of information on a voter&#8217;s registration application match exactly with data stored with the Department of Motor Vehicles. If not, the registration is placed in a &#8220;pending&#8221; file and the voter may be turned away. Reuters news service obtained a copy of the Georgia Pending File and discovered that black voters were on the list at far higher rates than white voters, even though a majority of Georgia voters are white. &nbsp; In Tennessee, a 93-year-old woman was denied her right to vote because she did not have a photo ID as required by law &#150; even though she presented four other forms of identification, including her birth certificate. &nbsp; In Ohio, a World War II Veteran was denied his right to vote because his newly issued photo ID from the Veterans Affairs Administration (VA) did not display his current address.  &nbsp; In Wisconsin, an elderly woman who had voted in the same polling place for decades was denied her right to vote because she had lost her driver&#8217;s license &#150; even though she presented her old driver&#8217;s license and proof of residency.&nbsp;  The Restore Democracy Revolution  The foundation lies in overturning the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s Citizens United decision, which has allowed corporations and wealthy special interests to spend unlimited amounts of secret &#8220;dark&#8221; money to influence elections . In addition to stopping voter suppression, our legislation would also put Congress on record supporting&nbsp;small donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season. Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions and establishment of national online voter registration.  We also call for a return to Congress&#8217;s traditional process of Regular Order. Under Regular Order, we find common ground and bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule &#150; and affording each one an up or down vote. That&#8217;s how Congress has fixed things, solved problems and gotten things done for more than 250 years. It&#8217;s time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.   GRANT WATCH: $3.5 Million in Infrastructure, Safety, and Housing Grants for Minnesota's  8th District&nbsp;  Under our watch, Minnesota&#8217;s 8th District has received more than $1.2 billion in federal grants for projects that create good paying jobs and make life better for people. We were pleased to announce two more important grants for Minnesota's 8th district last week.  The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a total of nearly $3.5 million in grant funding for new safety equipment and infrastructure projects at the&nbsp;Falls International-Einarson Field Airport,&nbsp;Little Falls/Morrison County-Lindbergh Field Airport,&nbsp;Princeton Municipal Airport, and the Bemidji Regional Airport.&nbsp;  Specifically, funding will be used to acquire snow removal equipment, reconstruct runway 13/31, and rehabilitate the apron at Falls International-Eniarson Field; construct runway 18/36 at Little Falls/Morrison County-Lindbergh Field; reconstruct runway 15/33, reconstruct lighting on runway 15/33, reconstruct taxiway (A), reconstruct lighting on taxiway (A) at Princeton Municipal Airport; acquire aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicle, rehabilitate the apron, rehabilitate runway 13/31, and rehabilitate the taxiway at Bemidji Regional Airport.    Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - via the Housing Trust Fund Program (HTF) - announced that the City of Duluth will receive a total of $127,522 in Community Development Planning (CDP) grants for developers to preserve, rehabilitate and construct housing, primarily for extremely low-income families.&nbsp;   The funding will create&nbsp;good paying local jobs, benefiting Minnesota&#8217;s 8th district residents and economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  To help keep you updated, we will be using the Monday Report to highlight important federal grants for the 8th District.   Our Week in Chisago&nbsp;&nbsp;   Wendy Redland, Executive Director of the Lakes Area Chamber of Commerce in Chisago, delivered an update to attendees about area projects last week. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen also provided chamber members with an update pertaining to my work in Congress.&nbsp; Our Week in Sunrise Township&nbsp;   Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen captured this stunning photo of his neighbor&#8217;s cattle farm while on a morning walk before work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Week in Grand Rapids&nbsp;&nbsp;   The Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce and Bemidji Area Chamber of Commerce held their annual Joint Forestry Affairs meeting at the Itasca County Fairgrounds in Grand Rapids last week. Pictured here is Tamara Lowney of APEX, a local business development organization, discussing innovative forestry products. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended  the meeting.&nbsp;  Our Week in Virginia &nbsp; Lourenco Gonclaves - Chief Executive Officer of Cliffs Natural Resources - spoke to a crowd of reporters at United Taconite in Forbes last week about the future of the Nashwauk mining site formerly known as Essar Steel. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the conference and captured this photo.&nbsp;  Our Week in Brainerd&nbsp;   Deborah Erickson, Director of Administrative Services for Crow Wing County, presented a program titled &#8216;Election System and Security.&#8217; She reviewed the many safeguards in place to protect our election integrity and the steps that are being taken to improve security. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the program on my behalf.  Our Week in Walker   Cass County hosted a ceremony in remembrance of the events of September 11, 2001. The ceremony included the posting of the colors, the ringing of a bell for each plane, and 30 seconds of sirens followed by 30 seconds of silence. In this picture, members of the Walker Area Joint Fire Department raise the flag. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the ceremony.   Finally... In Case You Missed It: Congress is Going to the Dogs - and that's a Good Thing   The 10th Annual Cutest Pets on Capitol Hill Contest announced this year&#8217;s winners. Our Legislative Assistant Eddie Wykind entered his two-and-a-half-year-old female Dachshund dog, Winnie.   Winnie loves long strolls in the park, lounging on the couch at home, and eating left overs when no one is looking.  Although Winnie did not win this year's competition, she did make the semi-finals. Winnie said, \"I was so grateful fur the paw-some op-paw-tunity and although I didn't win I made a lot of fur-ends.\" Winnie is paw-ndering how to bring home the bacon next year.

Preparation for Power Outages &amp; Flooding     Power Outage Preparation&nbsp;   Take an inventory of the items you need that rely on electricity, including personal medical equipment.&nbsp; Plan for batteries and other alternatives to meet your needs when the power goes out. Sign up for local alerts and community warning systems, including Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA).&nbsp; Monitor weather reports for the latest on the storm&#8217;s forecast. Install carbon monoxide detectors with battery backup in central locations on every level of your home. Only use generators outdoors and away from windows. Check on your neighbors &#150; make sure they are safe and prepared. Determine whether your home phone will work in a power outage and how long battery backup will last. Review the supplies that are available in case of a power outage. Have flashlights with extra batteries for every household member. Have enough nonperishable food and water. Use a thermometer in the refrigerator and freezer so that you can know the temperature when the power is restored. Throw out food if the temperature is 40 degrees or higher. Keep mobile phones and other electric equipment charged and gas tanks full.  Flooding   Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. TURN AROUND, DON&#8217;T DROWN!&nbsp; Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.&nbsp; Be aware of downed power lines near water. Listen to Emergency Alert System (EAS), NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions. Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified.

Nearly every update has had some kind of trajectory change, so please make sure you are viewing the most recent instructions and advisories coming from the . Below is a copy of the storm projections as of 2PM on 9/12/18.&nbsp;    I've been receiving various updates from state and federal agencies, and I will be passing along as much relevant information as I can.&nbsp;  On September 10, 2018, President Trump declared an emergency for the state of South Carolina at the request of Governor Henry McMaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized to provide emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, under the Public Assistance Program at 75 percent federal funding to support the state for all 46 South Carolina counties, in preparation for Hurricane Florence. FEMA currently has two Mobile Emergency Response Support units in South Carolina to assist the state with secure and non-secure voice, video, and information services to support emergency response communications needs. Additionally, the Trump Administration has temporarily relaxed certain trucking and energy related regulations to help .&nbsp;  If you have friends and family who live in an evacuation zone, encourage them to leave NOW. The window for safely evacuating is quickly closing. &nbsp;  On Tuesday, there were 1,600 residents in the Carolinas who spent the night in an emergency shelter, with that number expected to rise significantly as the storm approaches. If you think there's any possibility you may need to stay at an emergency shelter, make sure to locate one ahead of time, particularly if you are traveling with pets because only certain facilities have the ability to accommodate them. You can find a list of shelters .&nbsp;  Utility companies are expecting anywhere between 1 to 3 million power outages as a result of the hurricane. So far, over 10,000 extra utility workers have been brought in from out of state and are on standby to restore power as quickly as possible. However, with that many outages expected, it is vital that you prepare for the possibility of being without power for several days. Power outage preparedness tips can be found .&nbsp;  Another concern for the Upstate is flooding. Somewhere between 2-6 inches of rain are currently expected to fall in the upper part of the Third Congressional District over the weekend. It is important to not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Remember that just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.&nbsp;  Do you have a family emergency disaster plan?

Lynn Jenkins Weekly Update: H.R. 3635, Meeting with Oncology Nursing Society, & More!","body":"Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins *H.R. 3635, the Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act:* This week, the House Ways and Means Committee marked up and passed my bill H.R.3635, the Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act. This legislation will improve the coverage determination process followed by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) making Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). MACs play a critical role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to much-needed care. However, the process used by MACs in making coverage decisions to limit or deny patients' access to care is conducted behind closed doors, with little opportunity for interested stakeholders to raise issues or offer alternatives. As a result of this flawed process, I have introduced H.R. 3635 to increase transparency and accountability by improving the LCD process to ensure that medical evidence is not used selectively to deny appropriate coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. The bill has the support of dozens of physicians group, including the College of American Pathologists, and I look forward to further House action on the bill. You can view my remarks in support of H.R. 3635 here [link 1]. *Meeting with Oncology Nursing Society:* It was great to have Kansans from the Oncology Nursing Society to hear how I can best help their patient care continue to improve and modernize.

During August, I had the chance to speak at the Oregon Coastal Caucus Economic Summit on some of the biggest issues impacting our coastal communities. I was honored to join this conversation to talk with David Gomberg, our State Representative, at the summit and thank the Oregon Legislative Coastal Caucus for having me, and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians for hosting. I shared the work Ive been doing in Congress to combat wildfires in the west, including passing my bill to fix wildfire funding and end the cycle of fire-borrowing. My bill, which passed out of Congress and became law this year, will help lift the financial burden of fires from the US Forest Service. It will help free up their budget so they can focus on preserving the health, diversity, and productivity of our forests. I also talked about the dire need to save our salmon along the Columbia River. The presence of a small number of sea lions, who have ventured outside their natural territory, now pose an existential threat to a number of our salmon and steelhead populations. My Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, which passed the House this summer with overwhelming bipartisan support and the support of the entire Pacific Northwest delegation, has been one of my top priorities in Congress as salmon are one of Oregons most iconic species.  I also had the opportunity this summer to visit the WestCare Veterans' Homeless Shelter in Salem as well as the Veterans Village in Clackamas County. Its a shameful truth that in the United States of America more than 58,000 of our veterans remain homeless on any given night. WestCares facility provides 30 beds to homeless veterans in our community each night, as well as life-skills training, substance abuse recovery, and reintegration programs. And the Veterans Village is an innovative housing project that provides a shelter-first approach to ensure that proper services can be provided to vets in need. While I work to make changes in Congress to ensure that our veterans are getting the care they deserve, the efforts of both of these facilities are absolutely critical. WORKING FOR OREGON Weve seen some lifesaving drugs become astronomically expensive in recent years, sometimes overnight and often with zero explanation. Working on solutions to bring down drug costs has been a top priority of mine. Im very pleased to announce the first success as a result of my bipartisan legislation to lower drug costs that became law last year. This summer, the Food and Drug Administration announced the first generic drugs to receive a Competitive Generic Therapy (CGT) designation  a classification established under my bipartisan bill  which allows generics with few to no alternatives to come to market faster. The drugs to receive the CGT designation include several strengths of potassium chloride oral solution  used to treat hypokalemia, or low potassium blood levels, in patients who are on diuretics  that currently do not have generic versions available. We know that having generic versions of medication on the market stimulates competition and keeps the cost of drugs down for everyone. Thanks to the new CGT status folks suffering from low potassium blood levels will now have more treatment options available to them, keeping a check on the market and preventing unaccountable price hikes to these drugs from occurring. This is a prime example of the direct impact Congress can have when we work together on solutions to the problems our constituents face back at home. This summer, I met with the wife of a veteran who is 100% service connected disabled and retired from the US Army. Currently, the Department of Defense is allowed to withhold a veterans retirement pay in cases where they had previously received Voluntary Separation Incentive payments meant to incentivize early retirement, even if the veteran had been involuntarily recalled and sustained a service related disability during their recall duty. During this Congress, I introduced a bill called the Recalled Veterans Protection Act (RVPA), to create protections for service members who have been injured after being involuntarily called back to service to ensure they are able to receive their due retirement pay. In July we successfully added my legislation to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act  an annual package of bills. I wont stop fighting for this legislation for our veterans and their families to ensure that we keep our promise to our brave men and women. You also may have read in the news last month about a Vancouver veteran named Jacob McGreevey who lost his home while on his third of four tours of duty. Servicemen and women, like McGreevey, have earned certain basic benefits like knowing that their families and their homes are taken care of while they are overseas. Last year, I introduced the bipartisan Halting of Mortgage Exploitation of Servicemembers (HOMES) Act to protect our fighting men and women from exploitation by unscrupulous lenders while they put their lives on the line in service to our country. Right now, the law doesnt do enough to protect our service members while they serve their country and work to protect us  so lets change it! IN CASE YOU MISSED IT This summer, I called on the Department of Education to issue formal guidance prohibiting the use of federal education funding to buy guns for teachers and school staff. Schools should be safe, welcoming, and conducive to quality learning for students and staff. Arming teachers with federally funded guns would go against Congressional intent for federal education funding and would also go against precedent. Not to mention, it could jeopardized the health, safety, and wellbeing of our students. Read my letter to the Department of Education. I was pleased to see another of my bipartisan bills signed into law this summer. My bill, a reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA), continues agreements between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the animal drug industry to pay user fees that help speed the approval of new drugs for farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians so they can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy. As a legislator I am very attuned to all the innovations that are occurring in the human health sphere, and as a veterinarian I want to ensure that our four-footed friends also have access to the latest and greatest medical innovations. We worked hard to expand conditional approval in this legislation to animal drugs for major uses and major species, an expansion which is so vital to the veterinary profession. Conditional approval is not a free ride for companies, but rather allows us to do the best for our pets and livestock. This law will continue to allow and encourage innovation across the industry, benefiting owners, veterinarians, and, of course, the animals themselves.

The safety and security of all South Carolinians is of the highest importance to me, and please know that the office is always willing to lend a hand.&nbsp; Below are a few things to keep in mind when planning for extreme weather. I urge all South Carolinians to take precautions during this hurricane season and to seek additional information and resources so that you and your family will be safe if a storm hits our state. Before a Storm, remember these T.I.P.S:&nbsp;   Terms. A &#8220;watch&#8221; is a notification for residents to be on alert of a potential storm, and a &#8220;warning&#8221; indicates that a hurricane is expected in your area. Review the&nbsp;South Carolina Hurricane Guide&nbsp;for more information. Insurance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Important&nbsp;information. Review your insurance plans and have copies of important documents, such as driver&#8217;s licenses, medical information, and insurance cards. Plan ahead.&nbsp;Create a family plan&nbsp;in the event that an evacuation is necessary, and keep emergency contact information handy. Don&#8217;t forget to&nbsp;consider your pets&nbsp;when planning for a possible evacuation. Supplies. Plan ahead of time by&nbsp;creating emergency kits&nbsp;filled with survival necessities such as bottled water, non-perishable snacks, medication, batteries, blankets, crank radios and flashlights.  During a Storm:   Listen.&nbsp;Listen to local radio and television broadcasts for current conditions and recommended actions. You can also sign up to receive emergency alerts on your mobile device&nbsp;here. Evacuate.&nbsp;When directed by local authorities, you may be required to evacuate. Know your&nbsp;designated evacuation route&nbsp;in advance. Shelter. If you are unable to evacuate, seek shelter in an interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level.  After a Storm:&nbsp;   Be aware of dangers. Be cautious of potential dangers, such as downed power lines, contaminated water, or possible gas leaks.&nbsp; Document&nbsp;damage.&nbsp;If possible, take photos of the damage on your property or residence, in addition to making written notes. Seek&nbsp;assistance: Contact&nbsp;to see what relief or recovery programs may be available for your area. Be cautious of scams.&nbsp;Be alert to possible disaster-related scams such as fraudulent phone calls or price gouging, and report any suspected scams to the&nbsp;South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs.&nbsp;Do not give any personal information, including credit card and bank account information, to unverified callers.

Paul was a friend and a mentor, and he epitomized the very best Nevada had to offer by putting service above self. He served confidante to numerous Nevadans as his wealth of knowledge steered many of us to seek his valued advice and insight. His down-to-earth, kind demeanor was befitting of his campaign slogan of choice, One of Us. Paul was a son of Nevada and indeed one of us. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Paul as we mourn his passing. This week, I traveled throughout Nevada and my week began at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno with Google, local businesses, and job seekers at a Grow with Google event. This free, one-day event was designed to help small businesses, students, educators, and entrepreneurs strengthen their digital skills. I believe that theres no better place for a Grow with Google event than Nevada - a state that went from having one of the worst unemployment rates during the recession to now being one of the fastest growing states in the nation. Nevadas economic success is no accident - our state has created an environment that is friendly to businesses. We have diversified the industries coming into Nevada, and we have provided opportunities for companies to quickly establish facilities and start hiring. Ill continue to do everything that I can in Washington, D.C. to capitalize on Nevadas economic success and support our small businesses and entrepreneurs. On Tuesday, I was honored to host the 22nd annual bipartisan Tahoe Summit at Sand Harbor State Park in Incline Village. U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, delivered the keynote address, and several members of the Nevada and California delegations, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Rep Mark Amodei (NV-02), participated in the Tahoe Summit. Much of this years summit focused on wildfire prevention and my bipartisan Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, legislation that was crafted to protect the Lake Tahoe Region by improving water clarity, reducing wildfire threats, jumpstarting innovative transportation and infrastructure projects, and combating invasive species. Last week, I was proud to announce announce that I secured $12 million in federal funding to implement his Lake Tahoe Restoration Act in a spending measure approved by the U.S. Senate. Furthermore, as we did last year, well continue to make sure that organizations - like AlertTahoe  and others, are able to use new and emerging technologies to detect wildfire will be eligible for federal funding so they have the resources they need to get the job done. Just recentl, I announced that the U.S. Forest Service has allocated $226,000 to AlertTahoe to install and maintain new fire cameras in the Tahoe basin. After the Tahoe Summit, I traveled down south and attended the 16th anniversary celebration of the Nevada State Veterans Home in Boulder City, Nevada. Ive worked for years with the Department of Veterans Affairs to secure federal funding for the State Veterans Home, and Ill continue to press the agency for adequate resources to complete construction on the Northern Nevada Veterans Home located in Sparks, Nevada. PHOTO The next day, I was back in Boulder City with local officials, the Nevada Department of Transportation, the Southern Nevada Regional Transportation Commission, and hundreds of Nevadans at the grand opening ceremony for the Boulder City Bypass, a 15-mile segment of Interstate-11. I-11 has been a priority of mine for years. In 2015, I introduced legislation to extend I-11 from Las Vegas to Northern Nevada, and I secured this extension and designation of I-11 as a high-priority corridor of the National Highway System in the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, the first long-term highway bill in a nearly a decade to be approved by Congress and signed into law. This bypass is expected to save commuters 30 minutes when traveling between Henderson and the Hoover Dam. Looking forward, we need to match Nevadas growth by ensuring our roads, bridges, and infrastructure can keep pace with new and increased demands, that is why I am going to keep fighting to ensure that Nevada has the resources and funds to complete this project all the way up to northern Nevada. On Friday, I was back in Reno and visited Noahs Animal House, a full-service pet shelter to assist animals from homes experiencing domestic violence. I will always stand up for survivors of domestic violence, and find ways to help prevent future victims. In both Reno and Las Vegas, Noahs Animal House is doing incredible work by allowing victims to bring their pets with them to a shelter. This facility empowers survivors and its why Im going to continue to work with my colleagues to pass my PAWS Act into law so domestic abuse victims in Nevada do not have to choose between their pets and their own safety. As always, its an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate. I have offices in Reno, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C., and I encourage you to contact us  were here to help you.

I look forward to working with her in the United States Senate to continue our Republican majority and deliver conservative results for the American people - including lower taxes, fewer regulations and conservative judges. - Congratulations to Bill Lee on his primary victory. As I've often said, there is no better job than being governor of your home state, especially if that state is Tennessee. I look forward to working with Bill to continue Governor Haslam's excellent leadership of our state. - President Trump signed into law a bill I helped write and pass--with the support of Ivanka Trump--that will help the 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs learn the skills they need to find good jobs. The need for skilled workers is the issue I hear most from employers in Tennessee. - Millions of Americans who are between jobs and who pay for their own insurance will welcome an extended option for lower-cost, short-term, renewable policies that the Trump Administration provided last week. *Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:* - Legislation to give our troops at Ft. Campbell a pay raise is headed to the president's desk. The bill, which authorizes $716 billion for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, also supports important programs at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge to strengthen our national security. - The Senate passed legislation to help fund five Land and Water Conservation Fund projects in Tennessee - three National Park Service projects in Tennessee national parks; one U.S. Forest Service project in the Cherokee National Forest; and one Forest Legacy project, the Skinner Mountain Forest. The bill will also begin to reduce the maintenance backlog at our national parks - helping restore campgrounds, trails, and roads - as I work with my colleagues to pass the Restore our Parks Act, which would do more to restore national parks, including the Smokies, than anything that has happened in the last half century. - The Senate unanimously passed my legislation [link 1] to help bring new animal drugs to Tennessee farmers and ranchers, families, and veterinarians to keep our pets healthy, prevent outbreaks of disease, and protect our food supply. *Delivering a boost to career and technical education in Tennessee* [image = I was at the White House last week with President Trump as he signed into law legislation I helped pass to fund the programs that train skilled workers -- for example, a Tennessee high school student wanting to become a computer coder, or an adult going back to school to learn about commercial construction. At a time when our economy is booming, what I hear most often from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers and this new law delivers a boost to more than 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs and help put them on the path towards the middle class. I'm grateful to Ivanka Trump for her work on this bill. *Reducing health care costs: focusing on administrative burden * The Senate health committee I chair continues its work into reducing health care costs. Last week, I chaired a hearing on reducing the cost of administrative tasks - which include everything from the time doctors and nurses spend filling out insurance claims to buying software for an electronic health records system. I talked about Dr. Reid Blackwelder, a Kingsport family physician who chairs a residency program with three clinics in Tri-Cities. Dr. Blackwelder is required to have an electronic health records system because he sees Medicare and Medicaid patients, but unfortunately, electronic health records systems have ended up being something physicians too often dread, rather than a tool that's useful. Dr. Blackwelder still can't see a patient's records from the hospital he can see out his office window. [image = Last week, I had a great time visiting Maryville College, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary next year. My parents met there in the fall of 1931, so I brought along a few pictures of them to share. Thank you to President Tom Bogart for giving me a tour of their old stomping grounds. *President Trump's zero tariffs goal is exactly the right policy * [image = [link 2] It's time to do what President Trump said last week -- zero tariffs is exactly the right policy. That's what we did with the North American Free Trade Agreement. Over 15 years, we worked to reach nearly zero tariffs on many products, and now it's time to get rid of the steel and aluminum tariffs which are driving up the cost of cars and hurting the 136,000 Tennesseans who work in the automotive industry. You can watch my interview with Fox News here [link 3] or by clicking on the above image. [image = It was great talking to Tyler Wombles. Tyler is a junior at the University of Tennessee from Loudon and is the Managing Editor of the school's newspaper, the University of Tennessee Daily Beacon. You can read the story he wrote on our visit here [link 4]. *Working to fill potholes, maintain trails and campgrounds, repair visitors' centers at the Smokies and other national parks* [image = I joined Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Wednesday to build support for the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act [link 5] to help address the nearly $12 billion in deferred maintenance at our national parks--that means filling potholes, fixing bathrooms, maintaining trails and campgrounds, repairing visitors' centers and restoring our 417 national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, so Americans can enjoy them. This legislation could cut in half the deferred maintenance backlog in our parks over the next five years. The good news is that Republicans and Democrats who often disagree are in near unanimous agreement to fix our national parks, and we agree that it should happen this year. Click here [link 6] to see more about when Sec. Zinke and I looked at deferred maintenance needs in the Smokies. *Supporting Tennessee agriculture and expanding rural broadband* The Senate approved legislation last week that will help support Tennessee's agriculture industry and rural communities. This legislation is good news for Tennessee's farmers because it funds the Farm Service Agency, Department of Agriculture Rural Development programs, and agricultural research at Tennessee universities. It also includes $30 million to help expand broadband to rural communities *Below are some articles from last week I thought you would enjoy:* The Washington Examiner: Sen.

First authorized in 2004, Animal Drug User Fee Agreements (ADUFA) and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Agreements (AGDUFA) give the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to collect user fees from drug manufacturers to help speed the approval process for new drugs and lower drug costs for pets and animals. Americas farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians rely on drug user fee agreements to drive the cost of medications down and keep their animals healthy. Similarly, American consumers need ADUFA and AGDUFA, too. The reauthorization of ADUFA and AGDUFA will promote innovation and keep food costs down for millions of Americans.

VOTED TO OVERTURN THE WOTUS RULE Since the day the Obama Administration implemented the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule, I have been fighting to overturn it. The WOTUS Rule allowed every creek, ditch, and stream to be treated like a navigable body of water, giving the federal government power to unnecessarily regulate it. As I have done several times in the past, I voted to overturn this overreaching Obama-era regulation and will continue to work to see the WOTUS Rule permanently eliminated.

Engel - Proudly Serving the Bronx and Westchester Dear Friends, On July 17th, the New York State Department of Health announced [link 1] that the *Haemaphysalis longicornis* tick, also known as the \"longhorned tick,\" had been identified in Westchester County. Ticks can transmit several diseases, including Lyme disease [link 2]. While more studies are needed to determine the specific risks the longhorned tick might pose for New Yorkers, *I wanted to take this opportunity to share important safety tips regarding ticks and tickborne illnesses*. - *Avoiding ticks*: I strongly encourage New Yorkers to take precautions to protect themselves, their children and their pets from ticks. You can find numerous tips from the New York State Department of Health [link 3] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [link 4]. These include wearing light-colored clothing to spot ticks easily, keeping to the center of hiking trails, using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone, and doing full-body tick checks throughout the day on yourself, your children and your pets. - *Removing ticks*: Tick removal can be tricky, but removing a tick within 36 hours lowers your risk of disease.

Immigration Update  As my office and I continue to hear from constituents regarding immigration and families being separated at the border, I wanted to keep you up to date with my statements and work on the issue. You can click here, here, here,&nbsp;here, and here&nbsp;for previous updates.  Recently, I joined my Republican colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee in sending a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) asking about the Department's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) - specifically regarding the management, treatment, and reunification of children with their families who were separated at the border. Questions sent to HHS include:   How many unaccompanied alien children (UAC) are in ORR custody as of June 29, 2018?   How many children have been placed into ORR custody as of June 29, 2018, as a result of being separated from their parents or families? Is age a factor? Are siblings kept together?   What is the age range of children in ORR custody as of June 29, 2018?   How does ORR determine which facility a child is sent to upon entering ORR custody?   What steps is ORR taking to track and address issues of abuse within HHS funded facilities, including but not limited to significant incident reports?   What oversight does HHS or ORR conduct of HHS funded facilities, including but not limited to site visits, reviews, or audits of the facilities?   How does ORR identify an appropriate sponsor for a child?  This is only a sampling of the questions we sent.&nbsp;Click here to read the full list of questions we asked and the full text of the letter.  Please reach out to any of my three offices with your thoughts and concerns on this issue and others, and I will continue to keep you updated.  July 2 - July 6: Independence Day&nbsp;  Honoring Servicemembers on July 4&nbsp;  On the Fourth of July, I was honored to have the opportunity to thank servicemembers for their dedication and sacrifice to keeping our country safe. Here I am with three Pennsylvanians, from Berks County, Montgomery County, and Butler County, who are currently stationed in Europe. Updates from Washington, D.C.  Medical Marijuana Act  In 2016, Pennsylvania passed the Medical Marijuana Act that allowed clinical research to be conducted by academic institutions. However, federal law still prohibits schools, such as Penn State, from possessing research quality cannabis in the quantities needed to conduct meaningful research.&nbsp;I recently added my name as a cosponsor to&nbsp;H.R. 5634 the Medical Cannabis Research Act, which would increase the number of registered manufacturers of cannabis for research.&nbsp;  I also recently cosponsored similar legislation, H.R. 5520, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, to allow more research to be done at the VA for veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other service related injuries.  In addition, you can&nbsp;click here for information on my response to the January 2018 announcement by the Trump administration that it would rescind&nbsp;previous guidance from the Obama administration regarding marijuana enforcement&nbsp;- I issued a statement saying Pennsylvania's&nbsp;law and patients who benefit from it should be protected. Animal Welfare  I'm proud to be a member of the House Animal Protection Caucus. I previously cosponsored&nbsp;H.R. 4693, the Puppy Protection Act, which would&nbsp;implement stronger protections for dogs at a dealer of dogs facility, including standards for veterinary care, housing, nutrition in food, clean drinking water, and access to an exercise area during the day.  In addition to this legislation, I recently signed a letter to President Trump that calls for the administration to direct the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to improve commercial dog breeder standards under the Animal Welfare Act. Current standards are outdated and inadequate to protect consumers and their pets, causing many dogs to live in atrocious conditions that harm their physical and behavioral health. I will continue to keep you updated on this important issue.  Energy and Commerce Committee Corner: Legislative Update   This graphic shows the work we've been doing in the House for the 115th Congress - with 186 bills signed into law.

Before the fun begins, I just wanted to relay to you a few tips&nbsp;from the office of Wisconsin Emergency Management on how to keep safe this 4th:  Last year, 15 people were hospitalized and 102 visited emergency rooms in Wisconsin due to fireworks-related injuries, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Nationally, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says more than 250 people go to emergency rooms with fireworks-related injuries every day during the weeks leading up to the July 4th celebration. The easy way to keep everyone safe is by watching free community fireworks shows. However, if you choose to set off your own fireworks, please follow these tips:    Make sure you buy legal fireworks that are allowed in your community and buy from reliable sellers   Never allow children to play with or ignite fireworks. Adults igniting the fireworks should always wear eye protection and never have any part of their body over a firework.   Be sure other people are out of range before lighting fireworks   Always have water (a garden hose or a bucket) ready in case of a fire   Light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from buildings, dry leaves and flammable materials. Light fireworks one at a time, then move back quickly.   Never throw or point fireworks at other people or animals   Keep your pets indoors to reduce the risk that they will run loose and get injured &nbsp;  In addition to fireworks safety, ReadyWisconsin offers these additional tips:    While you are out celebrating, remember to drink plenty of water. Limit your alcohol use and never get behind the wheel after drinking alcohol.   If you are traveling, make sure you have an emergency kit in your car with items such as bottled water, snacks, and a cell phone charger. Check HERE for 511Wisconsin for traffic-related information using the free mobile app.   If you are traveling to northwestern Wisconsin, be ready for possible road closures due to recent flooding. Use caution in these areas and adhere to signed closures. DO NOT drive around barricades. For more information, check HERE.   Never leave a child, disabled person or pet in a parked car &#151; even briefly. Temperatures can become life threatening within minutes. On an 80-degree day the temperature inside a car, even with windows cracked slightly open, can reach 100 degrees in less than 10 minutes.   ReadyWisconsin reminds everyone attending holiday activities to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. You could protect your family, neighbors and community.

Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.  Hosting Townhall Meetings in Jefferson and Stafford Counties I continued my Kansas Listening Tour this week. In McLouth, I was pleased to share that the VA MISSION Act recently became law, making it easier and more efficient for all veterans, especially in rural Kansas, to receive the care they deserve. We also discussed the Farm Bill, how we must responsibility negotiate global trade deals, talks with North Korea and rural broadband and its importance to small communities like those in Jefferson County.  In St. John, we discussed several items including the upcoming Farm Bill; trade agreements and tariffs; the importance of healthcare and keeping our critical access hospitals alive; rural technology and communication, as well as broadband expansion; education, especially the importance of career and technical education; as well as immigration, where I stressed the need for Congress to come together and work on things we agree on in this realm, including finding a permanent DACA solution, maintaining high-skilled and agricultural visa programs, and preventing the separation of families at the border. I also paid homage to Carl Dudrey, a longtime friend and St. John community leader who passed away earlier this year.  Thank you to Stafford County Economic Development Director Carolyn Dunn for arranging my visit to St. John. Thanks also to USD 350 Superintendent Josh Meyer and to State Senator Mary Jo Taylor for attending.  Moving Forward with CJS Subcommittee Appropriations Bill My Senate Appropriations Committee colleagues and I are actively moving through the appropriations process for our federal government agencies, and on Thursday, the Appropriations Committee voted to advance the FY2019 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. As chairman of this subcommittee, I am pleased our bill passed the full committee. I am grateful for the partnership of Senator Shaheen (D-N.H.), the ranking member, in crafting this legislation, which prioritizes issues important to Kansans and Americans across the country, including funding for the STOP School Violence Act, EDA Regional Innovation Programs, NASA and more.  The Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act of 2018, signed into law earlier this year, will help schools train security officers with crisis intervention strategies, strengthen school infrastructure and develop anonymous reporting systems to help intervene in crisis situations before students can harm themselves or others.  The Economic Development Administration&#8217;s (EDA) objective is to foster economic growth in low-income areas with high unemployment based on the specific needs of local businesses. Over the last decade, communities across Kansas have received more than $30 million in assistance to help create an improved Kansas economy.  This bill also includes funding for NASA and its many different programs, including support for NASA&#8217;s unmanned aerial vehicle research and advanced composites materials for aircraft, of which Kansas State, Kansas and Wichita State Universities are active research partners. Our bill also prioritizes NASA&#8217;s Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Opportunities program to encourage and develop students who are studying these important fields.  Now that the FY2019 CJS appropriations bill has been approved by the committee, it must be voted on by the full Senate. I am hopeful the Senate will continue our process toward passing all appropriations bills prior to the end of the current fiscal year on September 30.  Advancing Kansan Michelle Bowman's Nomination As a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, I voted on Tuesday to advance Kansan Michelle &#8216;Miki&#8217; Bowman&#8217;s nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board. Miki was&nbsp;nominated by the president&nbsp;to serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in April to hold the seat specifically reserved for &#8220;one member with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks.&#8221; I look forward to supporting her nomination on the Senate floor. On Monday, I spoke on the Senate floor in support of her nomination. Watch my full remarks&nbsp;here.  Meeting with Students from KU TRIO Talent Search I met with students from Kansas City, Kansas representing the KU TRIO Talent Search program in my D.C. office on Tuesday. They detailed the importance of TRIO to their academic success and shared their plans for what awaits them following their high school and eventual college graduations &#150; including aspirations to come back to Kansas and serve their communities.  TRIO programs provide educational opportunities for young people, including first-generation college students, Americans with disabilities, low-income individuals and veterans. I support these programs to make a difference for many students in Kansas and across the country.  Meeting with General Anderson I had the opportunity to meet U.S. Army Lieutenant General Anderson, a senior Army staff leader overseeing operations, plans and training. LTG Anderson recently visited both Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley and welcomed his impressions of both communities and the vital role they play in the Army&#8217;s future. I was pleased with LTG Anderson&#8217;s transparency and his commitment to thoughtfully and diligently addressing areas of concern in the stationing process.  Vietnam Veterans Memorial Moving Wall Closing Ceremony On Sunday, I joined the Wamego community for the closing ceremony of The Wall that Heals.&nbsp;This wall is a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Wall in Washington, D.C. and features the names of over 58,000 service members who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending our freedoms in the Vietnam War.&nbsp;Since its creation, the wall has traveled to over 600 communities across our nation, providing the memorial&#8217;s healing legacy to many.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve had the distinct honor of serving in many different capacities that have allowed me to meet so many veterans across our state. Whether it has been greeting veterans on Honor Flights and welcoming them to our nation&#8217;s capital, meeting with veterans and active duty servicemembers in my office, or visiting with thousands of veterans across the state during my travels, I have been privileged to hear the unique and compelling story of our servicemembers.  Thanks to Caterpillar Wamego Operations and the Wamego Area Chamber for their efforts in getting The Wall that Heals to Kansas so we could have the opportunity to admire it and pay our respects to those who serve our nation.  Attending FHSU President's Dinner On Friday evening, I attended Fort Hays State University President Dr. Tisa Mason&#8217;s first annual President&#8217;s Gala. This gala is a part of the university&#8217;s current &#8220;Journey&#8221; campaign to help support students and faculty. FHSU is a rapidly growing institution that serves many Kansans, and I was honored to be at this event along with over 250 fellow supporters of the school, many of them whom I&#8217;ve had the chance to call friends for a number of years. Participating in Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony On Friday while in Hays, I attended a Hays Chamber of Commerce ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the new Post Rock Pet Boarding facility, which will offer dog and cat boarding and pet grooming. Congratulations to Post Rock Pet Boarding co-owners Kylie Sander and Dr. Heather Holliman-Pope on this accomplishment and on your great facility. Thank you for your quality service to the Hays community and its pets.  Remembering Ruth Browne On Saturday, I attended memorial services for Ruth Browne in Clay Center. Judge Brown served on my Service Academy Selection Board and I enjoyed reconnecting with her during selection time every year. I enjoyed often attending Fourth of July parties she co-hosted in Clay Center, and especially as we approach the holiday, Robba&#8217;s and my prayers are with her family and friends.   Now Accepting 2018 Service Academy Applications As students are finishing up the school and beginning their summer breaks, I want to remind them of the opportunity to apply to a United States Service Academy. Appointing Kansans to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.; the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.; the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. is one of my favorite duties as a U.S. Senator.   To review requirements and move through the application process, please download an application from my&nbsp;website&nbsp;or contact my Olathe office at 913-393-0711. All application materials are due to my Olathe office by September 7, 2018. After applications have been reviewed, applicants will be notified of interviews with my Service Academy Selection Board, which will take place on Saturday, September 22, 2018, at the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene.   Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

We must end the sluggish pace at which we are addressing border security and immigration in Congress. I also am working very hard behind the scenes to repair our trade deals. I met with both the Mexican and Cuban Ambassadors this week to continue to advocate for new and better trade relationships. As both self-imposed and retaliatory tariffs continue to weigh on our producers and manufacturers I want you to know I am working tirelessly on trade. Our President has promised to deliver new and better agreements, I will continue my work to ensure we achieve those. In other news, today we saw a touching story out of Salina, Kansas where a WWII vet's family was reunited with their fallen soldier's wartime memorabilia after more than 70 years. I'm so proud of my staff that worked hard to track down the family. _____  Kansas sees *pet*ential in this growing industry  I recently visited the Simmons Pet Food factory in Emporia and quickly learned how Kansas is not just a leading provider of food for Americans, but for domesticated animals as well. Simmons Feed Ingredients boasts an innovative array of proprietary animal nutrition products, serving customers in all 50 states and more than 40 countries around the world. The reason I visit great companies such as Simmons Pet Food is because of the value they bring to our Kansas communities. Being the home to not just one but three leaders in the pet food manufacturing industry means reliable jobs for families in the area. Simmons employees more than 600 people, and recently announced $38 million expansion to the Emporia facility. We discussed the negative impact the steel and aluminum tariffs are having on their business, as their pet food is distributed in cans made of these materials. I have called for the Commerce Department to target bad actors in their steel efforts, not allies who supply steel and aluminum that Kansas manufacturers so desperately need. We got the BEEF!  Kansans do the best job of telling their stories. That's why it is always a pleasure to have folks in D.C. that take the time to come by our office. This week attendees of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association Young Cattlemen's Conference spoke on several key issues that we have partnered on to support our state's beef industry. Stability in trade markets, livestock transportation regulations that take consider animal welfare and the 2018 Farm Bill were items that topped their list. I'm proud to have been a vocal supporter of each of these. Kansas' First District leads the nation in cattle sales each year, demonstrating the importance of this industry to our state's economy. Small Business Committee looks at barriers for veteran-owned businesses In recent years the VA has adopted rules and policies that increase barriers for veteran-owned small businesses, adding additional requirements that can delay or prevent these small business owners from contracting with the VA. On Thursday, the Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations discussed the senseless road blocks imposed on our nation's veterans. I appreciate the Committee taking a look at such an important issue, and I look forward to continuing discussions as to how best help our veterans transition back to civilian life. KS, AR, MN lead trade talks with Cuba Ambassador  I joined Senator John Boozman, Representatives Rick Crawford, Tom Emmer, and the Cuban Ambassador to the United States Jos Cabaas, this week in a roundtable discussing the benefits of opening markets between Cuba and the United States. The panel mainly focused on strengthening agricultural trade between the two countries. Improving our relationship with Cuba could lead to a stronger agricultural economy in our country. With farmers concerned about access to international markets a $2 billion potential market remains largely untouched just over the horizon in Cuba. I took time to emphasize the importance of opening more markets to export wheat and other commodities from our state and nation. Our Kansas farmers need access to opportunities to increase commodity prices. Because of Cuba's proximity, U.S. wheat, corn, sorghum and other exports to the island have a solid advantage over competitors both in shipping costs and delivery times. If the U.S. was able to sell its goods to Cuba, Kansas could top $55 million in new sales, with a 25 percent increase in wheat sales. Enough is enough. Earlier this week I took to the House floor to address our broken immigration system. It is imperative that immigration reform provides a work visa for guest workers so that our state can continue to be an agricultural powerhouse. Working with former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Bob Goodlatte, such a program was developed and introduced in the Ag Act which I am proud to cosponsor. The program would replace the outdated, seasonal-only, H-2A visas with new H-2C's for our dairy and feedlot industries. H-2C's are much more efficient and are particularly important for our state's livestock industry. Later in the week we met as a Republican conference to further discuss an immigration bill, which would PRE-fund border security, so as to avoid repeating past mistakes. Which members are still negotiating the details, we agreed that the remaining policies should closely follow the \"four pillars\" laid out by President Trump in his State of the Union speech. These pillars include; securing the border, legal status for children brought here by their parents at a young age, the ending of the visa lottery, and limits to chain migration. The brokenness of our immigration system and border security is on full display. Last month the Department of Homeland Security apprehended 50,000 people crossing illegally. I am looking forward to what we expect will be several votes on immigration in the House and keeping my promises to the people of the first district. This reform is crucial to our economy, our security, and our future!  Click the thumbnail above to seems floor speech WWII Veteran finds dog tags of Fallen Beloit soldier  Military veterans and their stories are a topic particularly close to my heart, which is why a recent story that has taken root in our district regarding a Kansas-born WWII war hero is so touching. In February, our office fielded a call from a friend of 1st Lieutenant James Garberg, a WWII vet from Minneapolis, Minn. While going through his war time memorabilia Mr. Garberg found the dog tags of one of his soldiers, Ernest Childers Jr. from Beloit, Kan. Mr. Garberg and Mr. Childers, Jr. were part of the 32nd infantry regiment that retook Attu Island back from the Japanese in 1943. Lt. Garberg had carried him from the battleground after he suffered injuries that he later died from. When Lt. Garberg's friend, Lt Col. (Ret.) Mike DePuglio, contacted the office for help with finding Childers' next of kin or any living descendants to return the tags to, we were glad to help. After a search, our caseworker found the fallen soldier's nephew who was overwhelmed with emotions by the news of his uncle's Lieutenant finding and returning the dog tags. Today at 12:30 pm in our Salina District Office, Ernest Childers accepted the dog tags, marking the first time these tags have been in the possession of a member of the Childers family in over 70 years. What an incredible honor it is to have witnessed this story unfold firsthand over the course of this week! Kansas Opportunity Zones  On the House floor this week I discussed one specific aspect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  Federal Opportunity Zones, which are designed to promote economic development and job creation in communities throughout our country. The Treasury Department recently selected 29 opportunity zones in 17 different counties across the 1st District of Kansas. When a tract is deemed an opportunity zone, it allows taxpayers to defer capital gains tax if they invest in prioritized local projects. This is a win-win scenario for both businesses and communities that will spur growth and expansion. Click on the thumbnail to watch my address on the House floor.

I hope you enjoyed the long Memorial Day weekend with friends and family, and took some time to honor the men and women who have lost their lives in defense of our nation. I had the opportunity to honor World War II veteran Norm Knappman as he participated in the Howell Memorial Day Parade  to pay tribute to his fallen comrades. His spirit and dedication to our nation really made the parade special. I also want to extend my congratulations to all of our 2018 graduates! I've had the opportunity to meet with many of these students  and graduating seniors  over the last few weeks. We have an impressive bunch here in Michigan's 8th District. Good luck to all, and have a great summer! In the News Clarkston High School senior awarded Congressional Medal of Merit for Outstanding Youth Leadership   Oakland Press, May 30, 2018 WHMI: Bishop Introduces Bill to Prevent Foreign Shipment of Opioids   WHMI, May 17, 2018 House committee-approved TANF reform bill includes Bishop provisions   Ripon Advance, May 29, 2018 The Detroit News: Bishop presses USDA on kittens killed after research   The Detroit News, May 8, 2018 8th District Students Receive Congressional Medal of Merit   WHMI, May 12, 2018 Lawmaker introduces KITTEN Act bill to bar use of kittens, cats in painful experiments   CNN, May 11, 2018 Bishop strives to give U.S. more control to scrutinize international mail for opioids   Ripon Advance, May 17, 2018 National Defense Authorization Act  Rep. Bishop thanks veterans for their service at the Howell Memorial Day Parade and Ceremony. Last week, I voted in favor of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019. The NDAA takes vital steps towards restoring our military readiness by modernizing equipment, increasing support for training in each of the Services, and making critical investments in missile defense and nuclear deterrence. Further, the legislation provides a pay raise for our troops, the largest in 9 years. I'm also pleased the bill included my amendment urging North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries to meet or exceed the 2 percent gross domestic product commitment to spending on defense. American troops are the greatest force for good around the world, but our allies must step up and participate in the cost of their own defense. Heading to the President's Desk  Earlier this month, the bipartisan VA MISSION Act passed the House to ensure our veterans have access to timely and high-quality care. For too long, the VA hasn't been living up to its mission to support and care for our veterans. This important legislation now heads to the President's desk and is a great step towards refocusing the VA on this solemn duty. Signed into Law  Last week, the House passed Right to Try legislation, and yesterday President Trump signed the bill into law. I was proud to support this legislation to provide terminally ill patients access to potentially life-saving experimental treatments. If there's a chance to save the life of a child or loved one, I believe they deserve the Right to Try. Great Lakes Week  Earlier this month I introduced a bipartisan resolution, H.Res. 868  , designating the week of Memorial Day as \"Great Lakes Week\". As a father and lifelong Michigander, I want my children to enjoy the great outdoors like I did growing up. We all know that ensuring the health of our lakes for future generations requires vigilance, and \"Great Lakes Week\" is an opportunity to celebrate our lakes and promote responsible conservation with friends and family members to protect our treasured natural resources. Combating the Opioid Epidemic  Rep. Bishop's Livingston County roundtable conversation on combating the opioid epidemic. Critical gaps in the international mail system are currently being exploited by drug traffickersallowing dangerous synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, to be shipped across our borders through the United States Postal Service (USPS). Currently, private carriers like FedEx and UPS are required to collect advance electronic data on packages coming into our country, but no such requirement exists for the USPS. That's why I introduced legislation, the Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act of 2018  , to require the USPS to obtain advance electronic data on inbound shipments and transmit that data to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), allowing CBP to target for opioid shipments. While there's much more we canand should doto turn the tide on the opioid epidemic, working to keep this poison from ever coming into our communities is an important step. Fighting Animal Cruelty and Government Waste at the USDA Earlier this month, I sent a letter  to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue expressing concerns and seeking more information about experiments on cats and kittens being performed at a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. In the USDA testing that has been receiving taxpayers' dollars for nearly half-a-century, hundreds of kittens are bred, fed parasite-infected raw meat, and then killed, even though the USDA admits the kittens are healthy at the study's completion. The USDA responded to my letter and we now know that the USDA has spent more than $22 million on these experiments. While I support scientific research, I do not believe the USDA should be spending tax dollars to unnecessarily kill cats in cruel, outdated experiments. That's why I introduced bipartisan legislation  with Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) to end the use of cats in experiments that cause pain or stress. Good Policy As a recap, here are some of the latest bills I've co-sponsored: H.Res. 785  - Expressing support for continued cooperation between Israel and the United States to ensure adequate capabilities to counter Iran's destabilizing activities and support shared interests, including stability and safety in the Middle East, and for other purposes.

Last summer, after two years of tough times with low water levels restricting access to the reservoir, I was able to go out on a tour of Detroit Lake with a pool that was 97% full, floating docks, and people enjoying the water. Im looking forward to another great summer season ahead. I want to thank Marion County for their ongoing commitment to the lake, and Marion County Sheriff for keeping people safe out on the water. Whether youre out on Detroit Lake, catching sun out on the coast, or heading out for a hike somewhere in between, heres wishing everyone a safe and fun summer! The last week of April was National Park Week, a week to celebrate the 417 sites throughout the National Parks System, including Crater Lake in Oregon. As Oregonians we love our national parks, but the problem is, we love them too much. The backlog of maintenance needs for our parks has climbed to a whopping $11.6 billion. Our ability to enjoy and appreciate that natural beauty is limited when upkeep on our federal lands isnt sufficiently funded, allowing critical maintenance to fall by the wayside. Not only does that impact our enjoyment of the land, but it poses serious risks to the protection of these areas and hurts our communities that rely on the economic benefit from visitors. Read about my plan to bring down that backlog and restore our national parks for generations to come. I had the pleasure of celebrating Earth Day this year at West Linn-Wilsonville School District's Center for Research in Environmental Sciences and Technologies (CREST), which partners with the local McDonalds to give a hands-on farming experience to students. This program teaches our students about where our food comes from and how important a healthy diet is while they work to grow food for their own cafeteria. WORKING FOR OREGON Since the fall, Ive been sharing the stories of Oregonians, who are also Dreamers, on the House floor because right now hundreds of thousands of young folks throughout our communities are being recklessly kept in a limbo of uncertainty and fear. Unless Congress acts, we stand to lose so many talented young people from our workforce and communities, which is why I joined 240 of my colleagues  Democrats and Republicans alike  to introduce a queen-of-the-hill resolution to force a floor debate on four DACA solutions. We must to protect these young folks and put an end to the unnecessary limbo that this administration has so heartlessly thrown them into. Ive been working for over a year now on solutions to bring down health costs and expand access to good, affordable care for every American. Affordable health care should be available for all, not a privilege for a few. Last year, I rolled out a plan to stabilize the individual marketplace, and recognized then that expanding access and ease of enrollment should be one of the core priorities of any market stabilization plan. Without enough healthy Americans enrolled in plans, we will continue to face instability, which is why this month I introduced the Pathway to Universal Coverage Act. My bill will make it easier for folks to enroll in plans, stabilizing the marketplace while moving us further down the path toward universal coverage. For our rural communities, state offices of rural health provide vital services to areas that often have limited resources and access to health services. Established in 1979, the Oregon Office of Rural Health (ORH) was created to improve the accessibility of quality health care for underserved rural Oregonians. ORH worked to develop recruitment and retention programs to attract health care professionals to our underserved areas. It has also connected our small rural health systems with state and federal resources while providing technical support for our rural health care delivery systems. This month, I introduced the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act of 2018 to continue to expand these crucial services that ensure our rural communities have access to affordable, quality health care. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT This month, I cosponsored the bipartisan Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act which will require judicial review of any decision to fire an independent special counsel, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller. And the Senate has a bipartisan version of the bill as well. The American people deserve to know the truth about how Russia interfered in our domestic elections and what can be done to secure future elections against this meddling. All the facts need to come to light here. Thats why I stand by Robert Mueller and his independent counsel oversight investigation into the 2016 election, and will continue to fight to protect and preserve the current investigation. Mid-month, my bill to reauthorize the FDAs Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA) passed out of my Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health unanimously. This legislation will continue agreements between the FDA and the animal drug industry to pay user fees that help speed the approval of new drugs for farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians so they can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy. As a veterinarian in rural Oregon, I understand firsthand the importance of these bills. They allow veterinarians, companion animal owners, and livestock owners to have the same streamlined process our human counterparts have for their pharmaceuticals. This means better, cutting-edge care when our animals need it the most. They also recognize the smaller market share veterinary pharmaceuticals have, and allow for a unique and safe way to innovate in the marketplace for our four footed friends. Our bills will continue to allow and encourage innovation across the industry, benefiting owners, veterinarians, and, of course, the animals themselves.

In fact, just this week, I was ranked among the top 10% of bipartisan Members of Congress in the House by the non-partisan Lugar Center.  Earlier in the week, I announced that I have cosponsored ten bipartisan bills that address a host of critical issues facing South Jersey including improving our schools, protecting domestic abuse victims, cracking down on human trafficking, and supporting our local fishermen. These bipartisan bills include: The Safe Schools Improvement Act which requires states to direct their local educational agencies to establish policies that prevent and prohibit conduct, including bullying and harassment. The Pet and Women Safety Act which broadens the definition of stalking to include conduct that causes a person to experience a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to his or her pet. The Human Trafficking Fraud Enforcement Act which establishes an office within the IRS that will investigate and prosecute violations of tax laws by persons that appear to be trafficking individuals. The Transparent Summer Flounder Quotas Act which delays current reduction in Summer Flounder quota. Additionally, I've also introduced the Survey Our Military Impacted Schools Act with my Democrat colleague Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. This bipartisan legislation requires the Department of Defense, along with other relevant agencies, to conduct a study and submit a report on the unmet capital improvement needs of schools that have a high concentration of military children and meet a certain criteria, like Northern Burlington County Regional School District. It's important we understand the specific needs of these schools so we can ensure they are receiving the appropriate amount of aid in order to provide quality education for military children.

Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email  . Sincerely, signature _____ Nolan's North Country Scenic Trail Bill Clears Committee and Heads for the House Floor  The measure, which will proceed to the full House for final passage, would help put the finishing touches on a unified 4,600-mile national hiking trail system that stretches from the plains of North Dakota through Minnesota's Arrowhead all the way to the forests of Vermont. With the spring hiking season finally on the way, the House Natural Resources Committee last week unanimously passed my bipartisan bill (H.R. 1026) to incorporate more than 400 miles of existing trails in the Minnesota Boundary Waters, the Superior Hiking Trail, the Border Route Trail and the Kekekabic Trail into the North Country National Scenic Trail. The measure, which will proceed to the full House for final passage, would help put the finishing touches on a unified 4,600-mile national hiking trail system that stretches from the plains of North Dakota through Minnesota's Arrowhead all the way to the forests of Vermont. It's important to note that the plan doesn't involve any new dollars or require taking any land through eminent domain. The route skirts around and protects about 100 miles of environmentally sensitive bogs and wetlands in Northeastern Minnesota that had been included in an earlier suggested route. Here in Minnesota our trails provide an extra boost to a $13.6 billion annual tourism economy that already supports 254,000 good paying jobs. Why? Because trail users get hungry and thirsty, so they spend money in our restaurants. They get tired, so they spend money staying in our hotels. They need supplies, so they patronize local businesses. Visitors fall in love with our region, so they return again and again. The American Hiking Association recently completed a study showing that when all the dollars spent on trail recreation work through the economy, the multiplier effect reaches $196 billion a year  supporting 768,000 good paying jobs nationwide. Moreover, experts tell us that for youngsters, hiking in the great outdoors helps alleviate something called the 'nature deficit,' a fancy term that means kids don't go outside much anymore. In fact, according to one study, the average kid in America today spends 7 minutes of every day outside, and 7 hours in front of a computer screen or a TV set. Getting outside hiking is great for everyone's physical and mental health  kids and adults alike. And it's good for our economic health as well. _____ Republicans Endanger Farm Bill Passage - Abandon Historic Bipartisanship and Democratic Process  Click on the screen above to hear my opening statement on the proposed 2018 Farm Bill Republicans wrecked the Farm Bill last week. Instead of working in good faith with Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee to craft a strong bipartisan bill, they abandoned the democratic process and passed a weak, mean spirited version of their own on a party line vote, virtually assuring the GOP plan will go nowhere in the Senate. Over the strong objections of Democrats, including me, this GOP Farm Bill would do virtually nothing to improve the safety net farmers need to survive these tough economic times  nothing to encourage young farmers  and nothing to bolster rural communities and small businesses. What the bill does do is launch a partisan assault on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that some 46 million Americans  including women, children, the elderly, disabled and unemployed, and thousands of military Veterans and military families  depend on to stave off hunger and malnutrition. And by doing so, this attack on the SNAP program threatens to unravel the historic partnership between rural food producers and urban food consumers that has always been critical to the success of Farm Bills down through the years. The so-called \"work requirements\" added to the bill are unnecessary and duplicative of other work programs, bureaucratic, and would cost the states hundreds of millions of dollars to administer. What's more, there are nowhere near enough funds in this measure to provide meaningful help to able bodied SNAP recipients to train for and secure good paying living wage jobs. On another note, I joined Democratic colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee last week to urge the President to work closely with Congress on a final Farm Bill to provide farmers with all the support they need to weather possible retaliation by trade cheater nations like China after the President announced 25% tariffs on low grade subsidized foreign steel and aluminum. As I have said many times before, these tariffs are necessary to ensure the survival of our iron ore and steel industries. But farmers should not be forced to bare the economic burden of these trade battles. _____ As Nolan Presses to Make College Affordable, Growing Numbers of Students Face Hunger and Homelessness  More than one in every three college students are food and housing insecure, and some nine percent are homeless according to a new study by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab. No college student should ever be forced into hunger and homelessness by the high cost of education, but according to a new study by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab, that's exactly what's happening to roughly one out of three young people who responded to a survey of 43,000 students attending 66 institutions around the Nation. Specifically, 36 percent of college students said they are both food and housing insecure  with not enough money to buy groceries, pay rent and cover utilities  while 9 percent reported being homeless. It's no surprise that according to the study, students in these situations have lower test scores, poorer grades and less chance of graduating than those with more resources. At the root of these problems is the simple fact that college has become unaffordable to millions of our best and brightest young people. A four-year college education was virtually free for the parents, grandparents and great-grandparents of today's students, and it ought to be virtually free today to help ensure a prosperous future for our people and our Nation. That's why I've joined Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and numerous others here on the House side in championing our College for All Act to eliminate all tuition and fees for low and middle-income students at two and four-year public and tribal colleges and universities. Just consider that in 1979, it was possible to earn enough money to pay for a year of college tuition  averaging about $2,800 dollars  just by working four or five days a week at a summer job that paid minimum wage. Today, it would take a minimum wage employee an entire year of working 40 hours a week to pay the average cost of tuition, room and board of about $21,000 dollars. Furthermore, in 2017 twenty-two states reduced the money they spent per student on public colleges. That's up from the 17 states that saw drops in 2016 and the ten from 2015, according to an annual report that tracks state appropriations and tuition revenue at public colleges. _____ Our Week in DC  Last week, representatives of Minnesota United Snowmobilers Association attended their annual conference in Washington entitled \"Tell the Truth About Snowmobiling\" hosted by the American Council of Snowmobile Associations. They took time to stop by my office for a meeting to discuss public land management.  I had a great time speaking at the Minnesota State Building and Construction Trades Council annual convention last week. Everybody was talking about rebuilding America and the hard working union men and women across this country are the ones who know how to do it  hands on and from the ground up. Nobody in the world builds it like the Building Trades.  A representative from the Pet Food Institute swung by my office this week for a quick meeting. A member of my staff snapped this photo.  Several members of the Minnesota Telecom Alliance stopped by my office in Washington last week to discuss funding the Connect America Fund (CAF), the need for the President's infrastructure package to have a rural broadband component, and the impact of a broken video marketplace on rural carriers and their consumers.  St. Scholastica TRIO recipient, Winonah Ojanen, and Rachel Hortin-Phelps, Academic Coordinator for TRIO McNair Scholars Program stopped by my office last week. Ms. Ojanen will be presenting about galaxy properties and post-starburst galaxy evolution done in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History and the Sloan Foundation.  Great meeting with the Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota last week. We discussed several key issues important to our labor unions including infrastructure funding. Our Week in Duluth  On Wednesday, at the MN Department of Transportation building in Duluth, Brenda Hoppe, a research scientist with the MN Climate and Health Program at the MN Department of Health, presented results of a vulnerability assessment which applied future precipitation estimates to an exploration of risk for Minnesotans on private wells. She addressed the monthly Climate Change Talk hosted by Minnesota's Lake Superior Coastal Program, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Sea Grant, and 1854 Treaty Authority. Dr. Hoppe described lessons learned from applying future climate estimates to public health investigations and the role scenario planning can play in our state's efforts to prepare for and respond to climate change. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Hannah Alstead attended on my behalf. Our Week in Center City  By the looks of it, it's hard to believe it's the middle of April! Just past these trees is the beautiful Wild River State Park and the St. Croix River. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen took this picture on his morning walk. Our Week in Pine City  The \"Creating Our Future Workforce by Developing a Youth Pipeline\" forum was held at the Pine Technical and Community College. The panel included High School Counselors talking about how they work with secondary students on laying out career paths and what courses they will need to follow that path. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended on my behalf. Our Week in Arden Hills  A number of 8th District high school seniors attended Academy Information Night at Mounds View High School was held in Arden Hills last week. There was a good turn out of young men and women interested in serving our country in either the Air Force, Army, Merchant Marine, or Navy. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Rick Olseen attended the event on my behalf. Our Week in Biwabik  Local leaders met recently at Giants Ridge in Biwabik for an East Range Community Action Panel event. Marcia Podratz gave a presentation to the group on Minnesota Power's rate review and other regulatory proceedings. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside attended the event on my behalf. Our Week in Hibbing  The Hibbing School Board Meeting took place last week and local Hibbing School teachers were locked out. The Hibbing School teachers are fighting for a fair contract after trying for the past year. My Congressional Field Representative Tom Whiteside snapped this photo. Our Week in Randall  The Semi-Annual Retiree Seminar was held at Camp Ripley in the Old Hangar Conference Center. Almost 200 military retirees and their spouses attended the event, which included presentations on TRICARE, Social Security, the Minnesota State Veterans Cemetery, and VA programs. In this picture, Kerri Schwegel, Outreach Coordinator from the St. Cloud VA, discusses the \"Coffee Talks\" program that helps new patients understand all of the services the VA can provide. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf. Our Week in Crosby  Cuyuna Range Elementary School welcomed the Class of 2031 to tour the school and meet some of their teachers before they start kindergarten this fall as part of their Kindergarten Round Up. Pictured here: children rejoin their parents for snacks after spending time with their new teachers while the parents filled out paperwork. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf. Our Week in Brainerd  Central Lakes College hosted a presentation from sociologist Gary Payne on Trinidad and Tobago as part of their Cultural Thursday series. Trinidad and Tobago is an oil-rich, rainforest-covered country facing the challenges of balancing extracting its natural resources while also protecting them. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf. _____ Coming Up in Washington This week: * This week the House is expected to take up H.R.4, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The bill contains two of our amendments adopted in Committee earlier this year to provide consumers with a \"one page\" bill of rights and also help small to midsize airports enter new markets. _____ Finally... Lake Superior Waves Crash Against Shoreline in Duluth  Click on the screen above to watch the big waves on Lake Superior during the storm last week. Heavy winds last week caused some giant waves on Lake Superior to crash into the shoreline in Duluth last week. Rain and snow accompanied the waves bringing over 12 inches of snow to the Northland - causing local residents to get out their shovels once again.

They are leading changes in our economy and speaking up about challenges in our country. Whether it's the threat of gun violence in our schools, the challenge of starting a career in today's economy, the high cost of college tuition, or the impact that money and special interests have in our democracy, young folks are working to make a difference in their community. I'm inspired by their passion and energy, and that's why I'm heading to college campuses to hold Student Town Halls.

Harvey Theater 1600 Chester Ave Bremerton, WA 98337 Now, on to the news!!!! Passing a Bipartisan Spending Agreement If you read the previous edition  of my newsletter, you might remember that Congress had only passed legislation to fund the government until March 23. In fact, so far this fiscal year, Congress saw two government shutdowns and five stop-gap spending bills (known as continuing resolutions). This is no way to run a government. Thankfully, on March 23, Congress passed a spending bill that finally, fully funds the government until the end of the fiscal year. No compromise is ever perfect, but I voted for this plan because there are important investments for folks in our necks of the woods, and because our country has to stop lurching from crisis to crisis. This bill invests in the American people and makes a difference on many of the challenges facing our region. There are families that have been ravaged by the scourge of opioids who will benefit from the funding this bill dedicates to combatting the opioid crisis. There are people on the Olympic Peninsula who will have a better shot economically as a result of funding for fighting wildfires, funding for rural schools and rural broadband. There are tens of thousands of servicemembers and defense workers in our region who have asked for an end to furloughs and chaos, and this bill finally gives them certainty. This bill will provide help to fishermen in Westport who are wondering if they can fish for another season, or if they need to put a for sale sign on their boats because of repeated natural disasters. The bill will help grow jobs by funding important infrastructure projects (through the federal TIGER Grant program and other important efforts). Families in our region and local businesses that depend on clean water will benefit from funding to keep the Puget Sound clean and healthy. This bill invests in folks who work in our forests, so that our timber industry can innovate and find new ways to compete in the global economy. And it takes the first step forward to making sure that America's elections are free from foreign influence and dark money. By getting this bill passed, hopefully this will now give Congress time to work on the rest of our nation's most pressing challenges. I hope the bipartisan cooperation that produced this bill will translate into bipartisan action that gives certainty to Dreamers and makes progress on other important priorities requiring attention and action. I created this video  to explain more about how this bill can create jobs in our region. I also outlined some of my important priorities that passed in the bill here  . Standing up for our Veterans Our region has more veterans than almost any other part of the country. That's why I formed a Veterans Advisory Council when I came to Congress. This volunteer group has given me great advice, and they've spent a lot of time helping me understand what folks in our neck of the woods want from their government. Last week, I got an update from them (just in time given the changeover at the VA). It is important to me that our VA system is serving those who served. I'll keep pushing to make it better. In the spending bill that passed a couple of weeks ago, I was able to get a couple of provisions important to support veterans. Specifically, I secured a provision in the bill that could be a big help to veterans buying a house. Right now, veterans are at a disadvantage when they go to bid on a house using VA loans, because the appraisal process is so much more burdensome that often sellers choose other candidates. The Tacoma News Tribune reported on this issue last year, and my team and I dug into the issue local veterans to determine the scope of the problem. Rather than ignoring the problem, we got language in the spending bill directing the VA to come up with--and report to Congress on--a plan of attack. That's the first step in creating policies to fix this problem. I'll keep you posted once we get the report back. The News Tribune wrote an update on this story, which you can read here  . The spending bill also included legislation I worked on with Rep. Dan Newhouse called the VA Management Alignment Act. It comes just as the management at the VA is changing. The bill directs the VA to address management issues to ensure veterans across the country are getting the care they earned and deserve. You can read more about this bill here.   Righting a wrong Imagine counting down the days to your retirement, then putting in the paperwork and finding out from your boss that you have to work years longer than co-workers who started the same day as you because of how the government calculates the time you worked. Some folks at the shipyard came to me with this exact problem. I think Washington, DC can do better for the people who devoted their lives to keeping the Navy's ships afloat. I just introduced legislation to fix the problem so that federal workers can make catch-up payments so they can retire on-time with full retirement benefits. You can read about the bill here  . I introduced this legislation because a constituent reached out to my office with a concern about his own retirement. Without that knowledge, I wouldn't be able to make this situation right. That's why I always ask you to let me know if you or someone you know needs a hand. Working for You I got an update from the Mason County Sheriff on their work to help people in our community struggling with opioids. I'm working in Congress to secure funding to help people get treatment for opioid addiction and support local communities, and I'm pleased to report that the spending bill Congress passed included $3.3 billion in help--that brings the total funding from Congress over the last few months to nearly $10 billion. But that's only the start. Congress needs to do far more so people facing addiction can get help from medical professionals and have access to better treatment options.  I also had the chance to tour the awesome Haven Boatworks--this small business employs about 25 people to repair and restore wooden boats. This is an example of the great jobs available to folks who learn a skilled trade.  I visited students and teachers at Port Townsend High School. Thanks for sharing your ideas and concerns with me. As I told these insightful young people: no matter how young you are, your voice matters. I'm going to keep working with everyone, every day from every angle to make sure the grown-ups in Washington, DC listen and take action so everyone feels safe at school and everywhere else.  Finally, I got to visit Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium where I got an update on their new aquarium and their policy priorities (including protecting red wolves and other conservation efforts). I even got to pet a lynx (which, thankfully, did not eat me after this photo was taken).  OK--that's it for this time. Stay tuned for more updates! As always, I'm honored to represent you!

From the inspiring service of our first-responders day-in and day-out, to the actions of a caring and observant mail-carrier like Amanda Nalley of Forsyth County, examples are everywhere.... THE WEEK AHEAD It&#8217;s with a great deal of joy that I&#8217;m excited to say that for the next two weeks, the House will be recognizing its annual Easter/Passover District Work Period. From the Rotary Clubs and Civitan Clubs to schools across Forsyth and Gwinnett Counties to manufacturers and businesses to Kiwanis Clubs and Commerce Clubs to one-on-one constituent meetings, I&#8217;m going to be out and about during this time learning from you....  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,  Rob Woodall Member of Congress             To unsubscribe click here.

Since coming to Congress, I have pledged my support for women everywhere. I was proud to co-sponsor Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney's bill, H.R. 19, the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act, and join my colleagues in calling for this much needed addition to the Smithsonian Institution. I am also proud to support H.R. 909, the Pet and Women Safety Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation would protect victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault and dating violence. While we have made great strides, there is still a lot of work to be done. Today, women are paid 78 cents for every dollar that men earn. Black women are paid 64 cents, and Latinas earn only 54 cents per dollar. Let us re-commit ourselves to fighting for equal pay for equal work and enact H.R. 1869, the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and ensure that women can challenge pay discrimination.

There were accomplishments for which I am really proud, such as the bipartisan effort to authorize significant funding to improve school safety. I will discuss this important achievement in greater detail below. However, there were also significant moments of frustration, such as the failed attempt to pass the Right to Try legislation, which is very important to me and to so many patients who are suffering with a terminal illness. For years, I have been working on a variety of initiatives to streamline FDA processes and empower patients in the development of their treatment plans. We have made progress, but not enough. Patients facing a painful death who have exhausted all available approved treatments do not have time to wait through bureaucratic processes. The Right to Try bill provides a compassionate, responsible mechanism for terminally ill patients, who would not otherwise qualify for a clinical trial, to participate in experimental procedures and treatments. With this bill, we would be giving them dignity, hope and self-determination while advancing medical research that will benefit many future patients. I was very disappointed that we did not garner enough votes it would have taken to pass the bill this week; however, I have received assurances that the bill will be brought back to the House floor in near future. Through my work with the rare disease community, I have met many terminally ill patients, and I am inspired by their courage. I will not stop fighting for them. To all of you with Irish roots, I hope you are enjoying a safe and joyous St. Patrick's Day weekend. Yesterday, as I was meeting with constituents, I was reminded of an old Irish adage: Always remember that hindsight is the best insight to foresight. I will keep this message close to my heart as I return to D.C. next week to tackle the spending bill that is needed for continued government operation and many policy matters that remain before us. Please continue reading for a brief recap of the rest of my work on your behalf last week. Protecting our Children Last week, the House passed an important measure I cosponsored, the STOP School Violence Act. This bill authorizes funding to train law enforcement, school personnel and students to recognize and respond to warning signs so that school violence can be prevented. It also provides funding for technology and equipment to improve school security, as well as, threat assessment and crisis intervention teams. The goal with this bill is to ensure that every child has a safe learning environment. While this bill is not a cure-all to address the problem, it does represent a significant step forward in preventing violence and helping to protect our children. I also co-authored a bi-partisan letter  urging House appropriators to prioritize school safety measures in the upcoming budget package that will sustain government operations for the current year. I will continue to ensure my strong feelings on this subject are known because I understand how important this issue is for the millions of children and families throughout our country. In talking to parents, teachers, law enforcement and superintendents in our community, I also understand we need a trained law enforcement officer at every school. I have pledged to support our local school districts achieve this goal and have shared information with them about the federal COPS grant program within the Department of Justice which is available to help fund additional School Resource Officers. I am working to secure additional federal funding for the COPS program in the upcoming budget.  Additionally, I applaud the Department of Justice's announcement that it intends to hold those who lie on their application to purchase a firearm accountable for their crime. To augment this effort, I have recently co-sponsored HR 4471, the NICS Denial Notification Act, which will ensure appropriate state authorities are also notified so that they may also pursue enhanced criminal charges. I want to be sure that those who should not have access to weapons are prevented from doing so. Advocating for Health Care Issues I had an informative meeting last week with the Surgeon General of Florida, Dr. Celeste Phillip. We discussed her department's disaster response efforts, the opioid epidemic and other public health issues. Working hand in hand with state officials ensures that all levels of government are on the same page and being as responsive as possible to critical health concerns. While she was in my office, we were joined by a group of health care advocates who presented me with a special award for my efforts to ensure access to health care. It was an honor to receive the Champion Award (pictured below) by the National Association of Community Health Centers for my sponsorship of legislation to preserve this vital resource within our health care system. Supporters of community health centers from around the state of Florida, including our very own Elodie Dorso from the Community Health Center of Pinellas were on hand to recognize me with this prestigious award. As I shared with them, leading the charge to ensure that these centers remain a viable option for the insured, uninsured and underinsured to receive high quality primary care, mental health and dental care was a priority for me coming into this Congress, and I was proud to have the provision I authored signed into law just a few short weeks ago. Additionally, in last week's Health Subcommittee hearing, we discussed an issue that is near and dear to many of our hearts. The FDA doesn't just oversee the regulation of medication for humans, but for animals too. We are nearing the expiration of that statutory authority, and as part of the reauthorization, we discussed a variety of issues that exist in order to ensure that our four legged friends are receiving the best possible care. As the co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus for the Humane Bond, I work very hard to ensure animals are protected. Whether it's the relationship between a service therapy dog changing the life of Veteran suffering with Post Traumatic Stress, a military hero dog keeping its handler out of harm's way or a pet providing companionship to a senior, the bond between a person and an animal can often be lifesaving.  There was a recent article  outlining the bold steps recently taken by the Florida Legislature to combat the opioid crisis. It is very important that federal, state and local lawmakers work together on these issues to ensure coordinated policies that protect patients. The state of Florida has implemented many of the measures we have been working on at the federal level. For example, I recently called upon the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to explore opportunities to require inter-state connectivity of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Additionally, I have supported modernization of and required physician participation in the PDMP. Under the leadership of Governor Scott, these common sense policies will now be the law in Florida. As part of my work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I will continue to lead in finding a delicate balance that protects patients, prevents abuse, provides access to treatment, holds those who are exploiting others accountable and ensures that patients with legitimate pain have access to the medication they need. I look forward to continued collaboration with state partners on this important issue as we work to protect all Floridians.  Providing Accountability and Oversight of the VA This week, I participated in two VA hearings in which we reviewed the agency's budget proposals for the upcoming year for both its health care and benefits programs. I was particularly interested in its plans for expediting the review of appeals claims. While I agreed with many of the priorities the agency identified, there are still opportunities for improvement. During my comments, I highlighted the importance of mental health, appropriate supports for Veterans' transition to civilian life and targeted research which can help many Veterans such as those who have been exposed to toxins. In the year ahead, I look forward to continuing to exercise our Committee's oversight authority to ensure that Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve. Additionally, I remain committed to finding a way to ensure that the agency honors its commitment to our Blue Water Navy Veterans. To watch my comments during the hearing, please click here.   Protecting our Seniors During Emergencies I applaud the state of Florida for passing a new law  to require nursing homes and assisted living facilities to have a generator and back-up fuel available in the event of an emergency. I have co-sponsored legislation at the federal level to require similar safeguards to ensure our seniors are protected. We should never again see the most vulnerable among us suffer, or God forbid die, after a natural disaster because those entrusted with their care failed to take proper precautions.

My first stop was the Muskogee VA Medical Center, where two of my veteran caseworkers, Jason Self and William Barnesboth Oklahoma veterans themselveswere awarded certificates of commendation by the Muskogee VA for their work assisting Oklahoma veterans in their darkest hours. (From left: Congressman Mullin, William Barnes, Jason Self, and VA Medical Center Director Mark Morgan.) The commendation reads: Your commitment to a regular meeting with Veterans throughout Eastern Oklahoma and building their confidence as a Veteran Advocate resulted in this Veteran contacting you for help when he needed it the most. Your regular attendance to VA Suicide Prevention trainings and fostering good relationships with VA staff resulted in this Veteran receiving immediate mental health care on a holiday and being transported to a safe environmentPreventing Veteran suicide is a top priority in the Department of Veteran Affairs, and for the VA to be successful in combating Veteran suicide we need strong community partners and good communication. Your actions confirm how much the office of Congressman Markwayne Mullin cares about the Veterans in Oklahoma. For this I commend you on behalf of the Eastern Oklahoma VA Health Care System and on behalf of our Veterans. If my team can ever assist you or a veteran in need, please dont hesitate to contact my office at 918-687-2533. Later in the day, I visited the Tony Goetz Elementary School to speak with students and teachers. There are so many issues impacting our schools and students in Oklahoma today and I was grateful to be able to spend this time hearing their concerns. Enjoyed visiting Tony Goetz Elementary School this week! JOIN ME FOR A TELEPHONE TOWN HALL When Im in Washington, D.C., I aim to be as accessible as possible to my constituents back home.

Telephone Town Hall with Congressman Mullin Monday, March 19, 2018 7:00pm CDT Call-in number: 877-229-8493 Passcode: 111439 REAUTHORIZING ANIMAL DRUG USER FEE AGREEMENTS On Tuesday, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee held a hearing to review a discussion draft of bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) and the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA). As the sponsor of ADUFA, I hope to see the House move swiftly on reauthorization of the animal drug user fee agreements for the health and safety of our animals and our food supply. In rural and agriculture communities across the country, ADUFA and its generic version, AGDUFA, are critical for farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians. Moreover, its vital for the food supply of all American consumers. The reauthorization of these animal user fee agreements between the FDA and the animal drug industry help speed the approval of new drugs so that farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy. Read more about our committees work on ADUFA and AGDUFA on their website at this link. HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE On Wednesday, the House passed the STOP School Violence Act by a vote of 407  10. This bill provides funding for student violence prevention training, technology to improve school security, school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams, and more coordination with law enforcement. I was proud to vote in support of this proactive legislation to ensure our schoolsand our kidsstay safe. Read more about how this bill will help secure our schools.

I also asked White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to fire President Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, talked with MSNBC about the President's possibly illegal payments to an adult film star, met with Tennessee educators in my D.C. office, introduced a bill to prevent the inhumane treatment of animals on airplanes, received an award from the Memphis Health Center, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Robert Kennedy, reminded constituents of an upcoming March 20 telephone town hall, noted the passing of my friend the New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, and expressed my concern about a measles case at the Memphis airport.

Kennedy  Reminding Constituents of My Telephone Town Hall on Tuesday Evening Signing Up for \"Congress On Your Corner\" and this e-Newsletter Noting the Passing of New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week _____ Joining Students in Demanding a Response to Gun Violence   On Wednesday, in solidarity with students at the University of Memphis and Rhodes College and students across the country, I remembered the 17 victims of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in calling for a meaningful, legislative response to the nation's epidemic of gun violence. On Capitol Hill, local students and field-trippers from around the country gathered in a symbolic show of support for gun violence victims and to call attention to the upcoming \"March for Our Lives\" events taking place around the country on March 24th. I commend the organizers of the Memphis march to begin at Clayborn Temple, 294 Hernando Street, at 10 a.m. on March 24th. In a related effort, I voted Wednesday for the Students, Teachers and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act (H.R. 4909), which passed 407 to 10. Asking White House Chief of Staff to Fire Jared Kushner As evidence piles up establishing Trump son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner's serious conflicts of interest involving his family's real estate business, I joined 25 House colleagues in a letter to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly demanding Kushner's firing. The letter makes the case that Kushner, who could not obtain a permanent security clearance and recently had his security status downgraded, is a threat to national security, especially in light of published accounts that he is considered a lightweight by the United Arab Emirates, China, Mexico and Israel, and could potentially be manipulated based on his tangled business interests and lack of policy experience. Talking Stormy Daniels with MSNBC's David Gura  On Saturday, I  went on national television  to talk about the ongoing legal scandal involving the President and Stephanie Clifford (adult film star Stormy Daniels) with MSNBC's David Gura. I'm embarrassed for the country that this President has besmirched his high office with this and other lurid evidence of low moral character. Meeting with Tennessee Parent Teacher Association  Also Wednesday, I met with Tennessee Parent Teacher Association President Cheryl Floyd and Anita Allen to talk about the organization's top priorities this year. It's always good to get a briefing from those on the front lines in education. Introducing Bipartisan Bill Outlawing Pets from Overhead Compartments Many of my constituents know of my longstanding association with the humane treatment of animals (I recently received another \"100+\" score from the Humane Society). Because of that and also being a senior member of the Transportation Committee, I felt it necessary to address an item right out of the news this week with the introduction Thursday of the Planes Ensuring Total Safety (PETS) Act  . Our bill responds to the outrageous situation the owner of 10-month-old French bulldog Kokito endured when her dog was stuffed, barking in distress, into an unventilated overhead United Airlines luggage bin on a flight from Houston to New York and died as a result. The bill would outlaw the practice and impose fines on airlines that don't comply. I was pleased to join New York Republican Congressman Dan Donovan on the bill. A Senate companion measure, the WOOFF Act, has been introduced by Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana and Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. Receiving Award from the Memphis Health Center  On Thursday, representatives of the Memphis Health Center presented me with the 2018 Distinguished Community Health Defender Award. Community Health Centers, like the Memphis Health Center, are crucial in the fight against illnesses and disabilities. I was proud to vote for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provided two years of funding for our Community Health Centers. Investing in our Community Health Centers is not only prudent, but necessary. I will continue to advocate for Community Health Centers, and I was honored to receive this recognition. Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Death of Robert F. Kennedy  On Wednesday, I joined Massachusetts' Senator Edward Markey and Congressman Joseph Kennedy III, and others, in recalling the remarkable life of my hero, former U.S. Attorney General, New York Senator and 1968 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. Robert Kennedy was a remarkable leader and would have made an excellent president if he hadn't been assassinated in Los Angeles two months after the killing of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. Today, March 16th, is the 50th anniversary of RFK's announcement of his candidacy for the 1968 nomination for President. It is sad but deeply edifying to review the events of that revolutionary year. Toward the end of my remarks, I paraphrased Robert Kennedy, who said: \"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope\" See my remarks at the commemoration here  . Reminding Constituents of My Telephone Town Hall on Tuesday Evening  To talk to constituents while I'm in Washington, I've found telephone town halls timely and have appreciated the positive response from constituents. My next telephone town hall is Tuesday, March 20, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. Central time. The telephone town hall provides a good forum to hear the concerns and ideas of the 9th District and gives me an opportunity to provide legislative action. For those who haven't participated in a telephone town hall, it's easy to sign up for them by using this form  .

Noting the Passing of New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter  On Friday, I learned of the death of my friend and colleague, New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. In her lifetime of service, she was always at the top of her game and I was always astonished to watch her, even at age 88, never miss a beat. She knew the issues backwards and forwards, including the arcane details of House rules. A native of Kentucky, she was a knowledgeable and gracious Southern Belle but a strong and passionate advocate of her Empire State. She will be missed. Weekly Health Tip Each week, I share a health tip in the hopes of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District. As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle. I was concerned to read that a child with measles landed at Memphis International Airport on Monday night after a flight from Brussels, Belgium. The scourge of this infectious disease is largely wiped out around the world thanks to nearly universal preventive immunization but its disfiguring symptoms and sometimes-life-threatening fevers are something all parents naturally fear. I want to assure you that my office is keeping close track of any and all developments related to this incident. To read more about measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) see this notice  Quote of the Week  \"My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He once wrote, 'And even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.' What we need in the United States is not division. What we need in the United States is not hatred. What we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another, a feeling of justice to those who still suffer in our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.\"  Senator Robert F.

In your service, When President Trump visited Cincinnati in early February, First Lady Melania Trump visited Cincinnati Children's Hospital to call attention to the devastating impacts of the opioid crisis on children. The First Lady was briefed by representatives at Cincinnati Children's about neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS can occur when a baby is exposed to opioids during pregnancy. Symptoms include seizures, vomiting, and wakefulness. In some cases, it can be fatal. Symptoms may not appear for up to three days after birth, so it's incredibly important to identify at-risk babies before they leave the hospital. I recently hosted a briefing at the Capitol, where we heard from doctors at Cincinnati Children's Hospital about the important protocols they've created to identify and treat NAS babies before they leave the hospital. I am optimistic that other states can learn from Ohio's leadership and pioneering approach to identifying and treating babies with NAS. Combatting illicit opioid use in our communities will take time, effort, and significant resources. To that point, the recent Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included an extra $6 billion in funding to continue our fight against opioid abuse in our communities. It was great meeting with the Angel's Rest Animal Society in Amelia. Many homeless individuals, including veterans, will not seek medical care or enter short-term shelters because their pets are not permitted to accompany them. Angel's Rest told me how they're teaming up with Welcome House Northern Kentucky and other veterans groups to provide services to homeless veterans and individuals, including transitional pet boarding so that our homeless neighbors can get the help they need to regain their footing. I recently toured Thomaston Woods, an affordable housing project for families in Southern Ohio. I'm pictured here with Rev.

Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Lewis and Fr. Nicholas Vieron; Bottom: Congressman Cohen at press availability with House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer, Sen. Lamar Alexander and Rep. John Lewis   Earlier today, I joined many of my Congressional colleagues from around the country in solemn observances of the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. here 50 years ago. We visited the Mason Temple, where Dr. King made his final speech, and the Lorraine Motel, where he was assassinated. I&#8217;m encouraged to see the genuine interest shown in the world-renown historical events that occurred in our streets and the tribute my colleagues are eager to pay to Dr. King. I commended my friend Senator Lamar Alexander, who introduced the Senate version of my Resolution Commemorating the Sanitation Workers and helped it pass the Senate earlier this week. Both Senator Alexander and I spoke at the Mason Temple and Lorraine events. I was pleased to welcome the Civil Rights hero Congressman John Lewis to the Bluff City once again. As the nation and the world turns its eyes to Memphis now and in the weeks ahead, I want to thank my constituents for the opportunity to help our city showcase our historic role in the Civil Rights Movement.   Passing the SOAR Act to Identify Victims of Human Trafficking    On Monday, the House passed the Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond (SOAR) to Health and Wellness Act (H.R. 767), a bill I introduced to set up $4 million a year in grants to health care professionals to identify victims of human trafficking. In a floor speech, I noted that many trafficking victims have occasional access to health facilities in the course of their captivity but few health facilities are trained to recognize the tell-tale signs that might lead to their freedom. I want to thank my bipartisan co-sponsors, Reps. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. The bill passed the House on a voice vote.   Urging Action on Airplane Evacuation Safety with Federal Aviation Officials    On Tuesday, I questioned top safety officials&nbsp;from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about the growing safety hazards posed by increasingly smaller seats on airlines, noting the recent accident involving a cabin fire on American Airlines flight 383 in Chicago. On flight 383, the emergency evacuation took over 50 seconds longer than the 90-second federal standard. The NTSB issued recommendations to examine the issue of emergency evacuations further after string of nearly fatal accidents and, subsequently, a Federal Appellate court ordered the FAA to examine the safety of emergency evacuations in light of shrinking seat sizes. Ali Bahrami, the Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety of the FAA, assured me that a study of airplane evacuations is under way. As the author of the SEAT Act (Seat Egress in Air Travel), which would require the FAA to establish a minimum seat size and minimum distances between rows of seats (approved by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and awaiting a vote by the full House as part of a broader FAA Reauthorization package), I don&#8217;t think those assurances go far enough and I hope to see my legislation to protect the safety of the flying public become law in coming weeks.   Talking with MSNBC&#8217;s Aaron Gilchrist on Gun Violence   &nbsp; On Sunday, I appeared on MSNBC to talk about the possibility that Congress and the President would address gun violence in the wake of the horrible shooting deaths at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. I told him I expected Republicans to permit modest reforms but mostly just lip service to more substantive proposals because so many members are beholden to the National Rifle Association. I also said that the dishonesty of the President on a host of issues, including his positions on guns, is becoming more of a problem, adding that half the time he&#8217;s lying and the other half to the time he&#8217;s simply wrong. See the interview here. On Saturday just after noon, I am scheduled to be on MSNBC again, this time with host Alex Witt.    Discussing Jared Kushner&#8217;s Business Conflicts with CNN&#8217;s Wolf Blitzer      On Thursday, I was interviewed by CNN&#8217;s Wolf Blitzer about the President&#8217;s changing and inconsistent views on a variety of gun violence measures, including his astonishing support for seizing the guns of the suspected mentally ill before seeking due process in court. I was also asked about Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner&#8217;s obvious deal-making and conflicts of interest as a presidential aide. See the interview here.   Kibitzing with Larry King about Trump&#8217;s Gun Positions      On Monday evening, I talked with my friend Larry King from Statuary Hall in the Capitol about the positions taken by the NRA in response to the Florida school shooting and the President&#8217;s parroting of those talking points. I told him raising the age for buying high-capacity assault rifles to 21 would be a tiny move and would do nothing to address shooters such as the 64-year-old who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in October or the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooter in November, who was 26. We have a problem with mass shootings. See the interview here&nbsp;(interview begins at 9:00 minute mark).   Receiving 100 percent scores on Environment, Social Justice and Animal Welfare   This week, the Humane Society, the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and the League of Conservation Voters all gave me 100 percent scores for positions I took in the first session of the 115th Congress. Actually, the Humane Society gave me &#8220;100 Percent Plus&#8221; for my sponsorship of the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act (H.R. 1847) and the Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act (H.R. 909). I appreciate the recognition and pledge to continue working hard in these important policy areas.   Writing to Caution Governor Haslam about H.B. 2251 &nbsp; On Thursday, I wrote to Governor Bill Haslam with deep concern about a Tennessee state legislative bill, H.B. 2251, that would direct the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to amend the existing TennCare waiver to exclude providers who offer advice about or perform privately funded abortions. The Medicaid program has been set up to ensure that Medicaid recipients have the freedom to choose which medical professionals they see. If H.B. 2251 passed, it would lead to a reduction in the number of health care professionals offering a wide range of preventive services to women, including access to birth control, cancer screenings, and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing and treatment. It would make needed health care inaccessible to many low-income women. I urged the Governor to oppose the legislation and to veto it if it reaches his desk.

My prayers are with the victims of this tragic shooting and their families. *Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Memphis Sanitation Workers' Strike * Fifty years ago, 1,300 African-American sanitation workers in Memphis took a stand for freedom. African-American sanitation workers had faced years of hazardous working conditions and discrimination in pay and benefits. Their strike would become an historic event in the civil rights movement. In January 1968, the workers began negotiating with Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb and the Memphis City Council to improve pay and working conditions. The deaths of two sanitation workers galvanized the 1,300 African American sanitation workers to protest working conditions in February 1968. Throughout February and early March negotiations continued, and on March 28, 1968, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Reverend James Lawson led a march from the Clayborn Temple that ended with rioting, arrests, and the death of 16-year-old Larry Payne. On April 3, 1968, Dr. King addressed a rally of 10,000 African American workers and residents, members of the clergy, and union members at Mason Temple, the Memphis headquarters of the Church of God in Christ. Dr. King was assassinated the next day on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel. Four days later, on April 8, 1968, 42,000 people marched in Memphis. The strike was resolved on April 16, 1968. Last week, I, along with Senators Bob Corker , Doug Jones, and Ben Cardin introduced [link 1] a resolution honoring their legacy and recognizing their sacrifice and contributions to the civil rights movement. It is important that our children grow up learning about how these 1,300 Memphis sanitation workers - and many others - struggled for racial justice. My thoughts on the Senate's work on immigration* Last week, the Senate debated several immigration proposals. My goal is to get a result on both border security and DACA, which is why I cosponsored and voted for Senator Grassley's legislation implementing the president's proposal, and why I also cosponsored and voted for the narrower bipartisan proposal offered by Senators Rounds and King--because it too solves the DACA problem and provides the $25 billion the president requested to improve border security. I also voted for legislation offered by Senator Pat Toomey that would withhold some federal funding from \"sanctuary cities\" that do not cooperate with federal agencies to enforce federal immigration laws. Last Thursday, after the Senate failed to get a result on immigration, I spoke on the Senate floor. I said that the president had done his job -- he saw an urgent need and recommended a strategy to deal with that need. So my hope is that the president will continue to advocate for a result, to do that, he has to persuade at least half the people he's right. He's a good persuader. Then the Senate will be able to do our job. That's not to stand in the corners and throw things at each other. Let's see where we can agree and do what we did on Civil Rights and fixing No Child Left Behind -- tackle big issues by finding consensus. Immigration is not any harder than those issues. We ought to be able to do it. Otherwise we shouldn't be here. It's hard to become a United States Senator, and while we're here, we might as well amount to something - and that means getting a result. We didn't reach a result last week but I'm convinced we can. *Last Wednesday morning, Tennessee songwriters brought a little Nashville to Washington, visiting my office to play a few of their songs and talk about the Music Modernization Act - a bill I introduced last month that will help them and thousands of other songwriters in Tennessee be paid fair market value for their songs.* On January 24, I introduced bipartisan legislation - sponsored by Senator Hatch, Senator Corker and six other senators - that will have a real impact on Tennessee songwriters in three ways: First, the legislation creates a simple licensing system for digital music services to reflect a changing music industry. Second, the legislation will make it easier for songwriters to be paid when their music is played online or someone buys a song they wrote. And third, the legislation will allow a songwriter to be paid the fair market value for their work. The bipartisan bill represents the first major consensus legislation that has the support of songwriters, music publishers, digital music companies and record labels. Now it is up to Congress to provide a solution. This is why I am working in a bipartisan way to pass the Music Modernization Act this year and help give Tennessee - and our nation's - songwriters the fair pay they have earned. #StandWithSongwriters *My thoughts on President Trump's budget* Last week, President Trump released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2019. The president may suggest a budget, but, under the Constitution, Congress sets spending priorities and passes the appropriations bills that fund the government. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will carefully consider the president's recommendations, but my priorities will continue to be making sure our national defense, national laboratories, the National Institutes of Health and national parks have the resources they need. One proposal in the president's budget I strongly disagree with is selling the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission lines. This is a looney idea that seems to keep popping up regardless of who is president. It has zero chance of becoming law. When President Obama proposed this in 2013, all it did was undermine TVA's credit, raise interest rates on its debt, and threaten to increase electric bills for 9 million Tennessee Valley ratepayers. I am encouraged the president's budget request includes a proposal to help address the National Park Service maintenance backlog, including at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I agree that we have a responsibility to address the growing maintenance backlog in our parks - which includes roads, buildings, campgrounds, trails, water systems and more - and working with Interior Secretary Zinke and my colleagues in Congress, I will introduce [link 6] bipartisan legislation in the coming weeks to restore and rebuild our national parks. I enjoyed speaking and answering questions last week at the Community College Congressional Forum about our work in the Senate education committee I chair to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. I've always said that community colleges are the \"secret weapon\" of our higher education system, especially at a time when so many Americans need post-secondary education in order to find a good job. *Animal drug user fee legislation is critical to keeping our food supply safe and animals healthy * Last Tuesday, the Senate health committee I chair held a hearing on updating the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Drug and Generic Animal Drug User Fee Agreements. We know that the human medical products we use are safe because the FDA has approved them - and the way that farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians know drugs for animals are safe is the same - the FDA has approved them. Similar to the user fee agreements the committee reauthorized [link 8] last year for human medical products, this year we need to reauthorize the Animal Drug and Generic Animal Drug User Fee Agreements. These agreements help bring these new medicines to the veterinarians who help keep animals healthy and treat diseases and for families to care for their pets, such as cancer or heartworm disease. We also want to ensure the farmers and ranchers raising our food supply are able to treat their animals with the safe drugs they need. Safe and effective animal drugs ARE important to both the consumer - that food-producing animals are safe to eat - and the farmer or rancher - that he has a safe and effective product to treat his animals and prevent outbreaks. According to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, the cattle and calves industry and the poultry industry are two of Tennessee's largest agriculture sectors. So it is important that farmers and ranchers continue to have access to new medicines to keep their animals healthy and prevent and treat diseases, and help keep our food supply safe. Senator Murray, the lead Democrat on our committee, and I introduced legislation to reauthorize these agreements last Thursday. I look forward to a timely reauthorization of these agreements to ensure farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, and families continue to have access to new safe and effective treatments. Last Tuesday, I attended a meeting at the White House, where I discussed trade issues with President Trump and my colleagues in Congress. I talked about when my dad worked at Alcoa's aluminum smelting plant. Today, companies like Arconic are creating new jobs to make auto parts from aluminum. Arconic employs more than 1,600 Tennesseans, and the auto manufacturing industry supports 130,000 jobs in Tennessee. *Last Tuesday, President Trump announced the nomination of Dr. Brent Park to serve as Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation at the Department of Energy. * Dr. Park serves as Associate Laboratory Director at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where he manages national security programs for the United States Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration, and was previously director of research programs at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His professional experience makes him uniquely qualified for this position, and I look forward to his confirmation by the United States Senate. To help in remembering names, try to remember one thing special about each person you meet. *#42 in Lamar Alexander's *Little Plaid Book** Contact Information: Website: Office Location: Washington, DC Office 455 Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC 20510 Phone: (202) 224-4944 | Fax: (202) 228-3398 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"5","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"LA","party":"Republican","score":4.3566957},{"name":"Congressman Thomas Marino","address":"thomas.marino@congressnewsletter.net","timestamp":"2018-02-11","subject":"Working for PA-10","body":"Congressman Tom Marino, Proudly Representing the 10th District of Pennsylvania *Working for PA-10* *From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:* Good morning, This week in the House, I voted for programs critical to our communities, discouraged sexual harassment in the workplace and kept our nation safe and free. I also introduced legislation to protect animals and recognized PA-10 athletes competing in the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Here are some of the highlights of my work in Washington on behalf of Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District: *Funding our Nation's Priorities* I was pleased to join my House colleagues to pass the *Bipartisan Budget Act [link 1] *which keeps the federal government open and increases funding for America's military. This legislation includes numerous programs [link 2] that are a priority to PA-10 and ensures our brave troops get the resources they need to protect our freedoms. Many of my constituents rely on the services provided by Community Health Centers [link 3] and Teaching Health Centers [link 4] to enhance their quality of life. This measure also repeals Obamacare's onerous Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). *Fostering a Safe Work Environment* News of a secretive process [link 5] for settling sexual harassment complaints against members of Congress sent shockwaves across Capitol Hill. To address this unacceptable practice, the House passed two bipartisan measures [link 6] that promote greater accountability and transparency for the congressional workplace. Any form of sexual harassment is completely unacceptable. I recently introduced legislation to ensure taxpayers not foot the bill [link 7] for the misdeeds of federal lawmakers and to require repayment [link 8] of public funds used to settle those cases. *Protecting Animals* As an animal lover, it breaks my heart to see any animal suffer or die because they are left in a parked vehicle in extreme heat or cold. That is why I introduced the *Keep Our Pets Safe Act* [link 9]. This commonsense legislation makes it a federal offense to leave a pet in a car. if the animal could die as result of excessive exposure to heat or cold, lack of ventilation, or lack of water. I strongly urge my colleagues in the House to support this bill. *Looking out for Taxpayers* During income tax filing season there have been a growing number of cybercriminals who steal data from tax practitioners' computers and submit fraudulent returns requesting refunds with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [link 10]. Cybercriminals have evolved their deceptive tactics to focus on tax professionals where they can steal client data. Should PA-10 tax professionals have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact [link 11] our Washington or District Offices. *PA-10 Goes for Gold* PA-10 has two athletes competng in the Winter Olympics. Congratulations to figure skater Adam Rippon [link 12] and luger Jayson Terdiman [link 13] who are going for the gold in PyeongChang, South Korea. Mr. Rippon, a native of Clarks Summit, qualified for his first Olympic team after being sidelined for five months due to injury. Two years ago, he was senior Men's national figure skating champion. Mr. Terdiman, who hails from Berwick, took part in the 2014 Sochi Olympcis and this year will compete in the Men's Doubles event. All of Pennsylvania is rooting for you and cheering you on from home! *As Always...* Please never hesitate to contact [link 14] me at my offices in the district or in Washington, D.C.

The passage of this resolution sends a clear message to the Iranian regime that America supports the citizens of Iran and their right to free expression.&nbsp;I introduced a similar resolution last week, and the full text of the&nbsp;my resolution can be found&nbsp;   Congress&nbsp;Must Permanently Bury Earmarks All members of Congress must stand united against wasteful government spending.&nbsp;For years, the use of&nbsp;earmarks was abused by many lawmakers to fund&nbsp;pet projects in their districts at the expense of&nbsp;taxpayers across the country.&nbsp;Congress voted to ban the use of earmarks in 2011, and when some members of Congress pushed for their return last year, Speaker Ryan pledged to revisit the issue later through a transparent debate. To his credit, the Speaker's leadership at that time helped avert a bad decision. Lifting the earmark ban&nbsp;would be a disservice to the American taxpayer and a major step backward in our fight for fiscal responsibility. I am hopeful that the upcoming conversation on this subject&nbsp;will lead to Congress burying earmarks for good. Bringing back the earmark gravy train is the opposite of draining the swamp.

That was the topic of discussion at a recent hearing I chaired on \"Digital Decision-Making,\" held before the Senate subcommittee that oversees Internet and telecommunications issues. Artificial intelligence, often referred to as AI, might sound straight out of a science fiction book or TV show, but it is becoming an increasingly common, if not instrumental, part of everyday life. AI is the technology that enables a machine to make a decision based on the data it has collected, such as when a smartphone gives driving directions around congested traffic or an e-mail system detects spam messages. Social media, online shopping, and preventing credit card fraud all have AI components. The applications are widespread, and the technology is evolving swiftly, creating a need for conversations to ensure it is being used safely and responsibly. The experts who testified at the hearing detailed how AI is being harnessed to improve ways farmers grow crops, doctors treat illnesses, manufacturers produce goods, and teachers give feedback to students. There are revolutionary, headline-grabbing AI breakthroughs such as self-driving cars, but there are also much more subtle public and private sector advancements in AI that are working to cut costs, boost productivity, and create better lives for Americans. *MSU Working on Robots for Law Enforcement, Therapy* A lot of that work is being done in Mississippi. One of the hearing's witnesses was Dr. Cindy L. Bethel, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Mississippi State University. In her testimony, she noted three specific AI projects at the university. One is using AI research for robots that could help law enforcement respond to dangerous situations. The robots would collect information about the crime scene before officers have to put themselves in harm's way. Another project is focusing on an autonomous transport system for cargo, and a third is developing a robotic therapy dog, which could be used by those who are allergic to pets. Likewise, for the past two years, the University of Mississippi has held a Tech Summit to engage students, faculty, industry experts, business executives, and policymakers on the future of technology in our state and nation. The forum reaffirms Mississippi's reputation as a place for innovation and illustrates the commitment of our universities to help lead the way. *Software Industry Delivers Jobs, Economic Benefits in Miss.* Advancements in AI could have a major impact on the careers available to tomorrow's workforce. I am a strong advocate of STEM education and authored a bill earlier this year to promote computer science programs. The field is ripe for young talent, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expecting 1.3 million job openings in computing by 2022. During the subcommittee hearing, Victoria Espinel, chief executive officer of The Software Alliance, noted that the software industry supports 7,000 jobs and generates more than $800 million in Mississippi. This is an exciting time for our state, and I look forward to seeing how AI can continue to transform our communities in positive ways. The possibilities are truly limitless. *Other news this week:* - Wicker Proposal for 355 Ships Signed Into Law [link 1] - Wicker Announces Safety Update for Navy Training Jets [link 2] - Senators Support Block Buy of Future Aircraft Carriers [link 3] - Wicker, Hassan Introduce Internet of Things Consumer TIPS Act [link 4] - Wicker Responds to FCC Vote on Open Internet [link 5] - Wicker Convenes Hearing on Artificial Intelligence Technologies [link 6] - Wicker Receives Aircraft Owners & Pilots Association Award [link 7] - Wicker, Cardin Name Kyle Parker to Lead U.S. Helsinki Commission Staff [link 8] *Fox & Friends First Highlights Progress on T-45 Training Jet Safety Issues [link 9]* * [image = [link 10]* Watch as Fox & Friends First reports on Senator Wicker's efforts to expedite a solution to recent safety issues with the Navy's T-45 training jets, which are based in Meridian. *Wicker Supports Block Buy of 2 Gerald R.

There is no doubt about it. Last week, I was handed a 479-page tax bill just hours before it was scheduled for a final vote. A small group of senators wrote this disastrous scheme behind closed doors with no input from the public, and they gave nobody time to read it. The bill included last-minute additions scribbled in the margins that nobody could read. As we began voting on amendments, folks were finding secret pet projects and sweetheart deals that were snuck into the bill at the very last minute. That was Washington at its worst. Our nations founders must have been turning in their graves. My job is to hold Washington accountable to Montana. Thats why on the Senate Banking Committee, I am working closely with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to rise above the dysfunction. After months of negotiations with folks from both parties, we struck a deal on a major bill that delivers much-needed relief to Montana from Washingtons one-size-fits-all regulations. Our bipartisan legislation will cut red tape for small community banks and credit unions and it increase access to capital for local businesses, farmers and ranchers, and families. It also strengthens consumer protections against Wall Street. Our bill is bringing folks from all walks of life and political parties together, and it is forging a new path of bipartisanship in the Senate. On Tuesday, we held a committee meeting to discuss and make changes to the bill, which lasted over 6 hours. That is how it is supposed to work in Washington: open, fair debate in the light of dayon a bill everyone is allowed to discuss. Our process drafting this bill has been transparent and our bill is posted online HERE for all to see. None of that was true about the unpopular tax reform bill that will add another $1.5 trillion to the national debt. Last week, we saw how partisan Washington can be. But when folks put politics aside and work towards a common goal, we can break through the dysfunction and do whats best for the country.

Discussing the news from the Treasury during a press conference with my colleague, Rep. John Larson of Connecticut           Helping our Neighbors This week I stopped by the Enfield Food Shelf to see first-hand the work that local volunteers are doing to help friends and neighbors in the community. There, I helped hand out turkeys and met with some volunteers. Over the last few days, they&#8217;ve seen hundreds of people come for some extra help this Thanksgiving for their families, and even their pets. Thank you to all those in Enfield -- and communities across eastern Connecticut -- who are helping to make this holiday a little brighter for their neighbors.       Handing out turkeys with volunteers at the Enfield Food Shelf      Meeting the New Navy Secretary I recently met with our newest Navy Secretary, Richard V. Spencer. Secretary Spencer is a Connecticut native with long ties to our region -- his father worked at Electric Boat in the 1940s. Although we have spoken by phone a few times since he was confirmed, this was our first chance to talk face-to-face and discuss the challenges facing our Navy. In our meeting, we talked about a range of issues that we are grappling with on the Seapower subcommittee -- expanding the Navy surface and undersea fleet, increasing capabilities of our ships and following through on the changes needed in light of the ship collisions earlier this year. I appreciated his candor and willingness to engage with me as ranking member of the subcommittee, and look forward to working with him. I also invited Secretary Spencer to come visit eastern Connecticut to see firsthand the outstanding work that our sailors at Submarine Base New London, as well as the talented workforce at Electric Boat, do every single day to support our Navy. He committed to visiting, and I hope he can make it up soon!         Meeting with Navy Secretary Spencer in my Washington, D.C. office          Blue Ribbon Honors for Eastern Connecticut Schools In September, our region got the good news that three schools in eastern Connecticut were recognized as Blue Ribbon schools by the federal Department of Education: East Lyme High School, Thomas W. Mahan Elementary School in Norwich, and the Oakdale Elementary School in Montville. This award, granted by the United States Department of Education, honors schools demonstrating high achievement. These schools were three of the five honored from Connecticut this year, and among the the 342 across the country to receive the Blue Ribbon. Unfortunately, the team at Mahan Elementary in Norwich did not have the budget to send anyone to Washington to receive their award -- so I stopped by this week to present it to them. &nbsp;During my visit, I visited classrooms and got some great questions from the students. More importantly I got to see firsthand the work that had earned the school this well-deserved recognition. Congratulations to all of those that have worked so hard to ensure that our children receive the best education possible. Well done!       Celebrating the Blue Ribbon designation at Mahan Elementary in Norwich       Thank you, as always, for reading this update. I wish you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving.

This legislation will finally deliver relief from America's antiquated and overly burdensome tax code which I believe is the greatest threat to economic opportunity in this country. Most importantly, this plan will give middle-class American families, on average, a $1,182 tax cut. I have been asking families across the First District what they would do with the hard-earned dollars our plan would let Americans keep from their paychecks. They told me they will help their families, give back to their communities, or invest in their businesses and create jobs. This plan will empower all Americans to achieve the American Dream and I am excited to work with my colleagues to finalize the largest reform of our tax code in more than thirty years. Among other tax relief measures, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle- income Americans to Zero, 12%, 25%, and 35% while continuing to maintain 39.6% for high-income Americans; Significantly increases the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples; Eliminates special-interest deductions; Establishes a new Family Credit, which includes expanding the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600; Preserves the Earned Income Tax Credit and the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages and maintains the home mortgage deduction for newly purchased homes up to $500,000; Lowers the corporate rate to 20%, down from 35%; and, Reduces the tax rate on small business to no more than 25% - the lowest tax rate on small business income since World War II.

The legislation extends the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for five years. I am glad this legislation passed the House this week, but we're over a month late in reauthorizing the program while the families of 9 million children are holding their breath to see whether their kids are going to have health insurance. The reason we are so delayed is because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle asked us to delay, and in good faith, we did. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided to delay our efforts to pass the bill out of the Energy and Commerce Committee and they decided to delay bringing the bill to the floor for a vote. I would hope they have a good reason for these delaying tactics, but the truth is that they opposed a provision requested by President Obama in his fiscal year 2013 - fiscal year 2017 budgets that has a minor impact on the highest earners under Medicare. This is politics at its worst. I hope the Senate will act swiftly on this legislation. The more than 232,000 children in Georgia who rely on CHIP for their health insurance are depending on it. FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CXXXVIII Monday, October 30, 2017: I wake up this morning in Bridgewater, New Jersey, after having flown here yesterday from Savannah. Im here to visit with Sanofi, a worldwide leader in pharmaceutical manufacturing and life sciences. As a pharmacist, I am very familiar with the company as I have dispensed many of their products throughout my professional career. My first meeting is with the executive leadership team as they bring me up to date with issues impacting their business and challenges they face in the health care marketplace. Afterwards, I have the honor of addressing their employees to bring them up to date on Washington issues, particularly health care, and participate in a question and answer session. Next, I head to Swedesboro, New Jersey, where I tour Wedgewood Pharmacy, one of the largest compounding pharmacies in the United States. Although they serve the human health market, their main emphasis is the veterinary market where they have made over 7,500 different preparations for companion animals like dogs, cats, birds and horses as well as some less common like hippopotamuses and reptiles. During my visit I asked one of the pharmacists what was the most unusual animal for which she had ever prepared a medication. Her response was that they once filled a prescription for a pet dolphin! I forgot to ask if its name was Flipper. Afterwards, I head to Philadelphia where I take a flight to Atlanta to attend the Georgia Republican Partys Annual Chairmans Dinner with guest speaker Dr. Ben Carson, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

Protecting America's Energy Infrastructure I led a bi-partisan letter, signed by 84 of my colleagues, asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the Department of Justice's efforts to prosecute individuals who engage in criminal activity against our energy infrastructure. Environmental extremists have been open about their intentions to damage energy infrastructure and to harm the individuals who work in that industry. I will always support Americans' First Amendment right to protest. But destruction of property and violence against individuals are both illegal and potentially fatal.&nbsp;The Americans who live around and rely daily on this infrastructure deserve the opportunity to feel safe in their homes.&nbsp; Restoring Article I Powers to Congress  I voted for H.R. 469,&nbsp;legislation that shores up legislative branch power in a few ways. It gives job creators and state regulators the ability to participate in the process of creating new regulations, so that the Judicial Branch alone is not crafting new regulations through litigation proceedings. It requires the Treasury Department to be more transparent about the ways in which Judgement Fund dollars are dispensed, ensuring court judgements and settlements don't end up in the hands of state sponsors of terror. And it improves the process for Congress to intervene in court cases that bring into question the constitutional powers of the Legislative Branch.&nbsp;       H.R. 469 helps to reassert the Constitutional powers of Congress.    Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act    I voted for the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act, important legislation that ends a practice of the previous administration where, in my opinion, the Department of Justice required donations to liberal, third-party, outside groups as part of settlement agreements, basically using these settlements to fund its pet political causes instead of returning those dollars to actual lawsuit victims or the taxpayer. No DOJ should ever have the opportunity to use settlements for political gain. I&#8217;m thankful Attorney General Sessions has ended this practice. H.R. 732 allows us to permanently abolish this practice. Simple and Fair Tax Reform The House will soon release its tax reform plan. I'm eager to review the package and offer feedback on behalf of 4th Congressional District voters. If you have thoughts about tax reform, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office to share them with me. You can visit my website to send an email or you can call my office. No matter what, I will be fighting for a tax code that is both simple and fair. Letter on Amazon's Second Headquarters to Colorado I joined the rest of the Colorado U.S. House delegation in encouraging Amazon to locate their second headquarters, coming with 50,000 jobs, in our state. Our state has much to offer, and the letter provided a chance for us to promote Colorado's incredible living environment. Our outdoor recreation opportunities, strong education system, dynamic employers, moderate cost of living, wealth of energy sources, and strong transportation infrastructure all incentivize employers to locate their businesses in this beautiful state.  Helping Veterans Back in Colorado, I had the opportunity to sit down with several veterans who have struggled to receive the care they need from an overly bureaucratic, poorly managed Veterans Affairs Administration. Many of their stories were simply heartbreaking. These individuals paid a cost to defend our nation, and now they barely receive the healthcare they need. My office is working hard to resolve their individual cases, but I'm also pushing in Congress for&nbsp;reforms that &nbsp;provide better care and greater choice for all our heroes.       I met with veterans who have faced red tape and poor care through the Veterans Affairs Administration.    &nbsp; As always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, and&nbsp;Instagram.

National Sheriffs' Association [cid:image004.png@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] John Thompson, Deputy Executive Director On Tuesday, I met with John Thompson of the National Sheriffs' Association and discussed the importance of allowing domestic violence victims to bring their pets with them to shelters. Pets are members of the family and can provide great comfort to domestic violence victims. Currently, most shelters do not have the resources to house pets, but I fully support legislation that would give shelters access to grants to build pet amenities. Minnesota Telecom Alliance [cid:image005.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] This week, the Minnesota Telecom Alliance (MTA) visited my office to thank me for leading a letter urging the FCC to address the budget shortfall in the High-Cost Universal Service Fund (USF). A lack of sufficient funding for rural broadband development continues to put millions of Americans at a significant disadvantage. I appreciate the perspective of MTA as Congress works to connect rural residents, businesses, producers, and providers to each other and the world. Farm and Community Listening Sessions [cid:image006.png@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] Senator Klobuchar and I were pleased to join many farm commodity groups in Red Lake Falls for a listening session hosted by the wheat and barley growers. We addressed a wide range of questions, from the status of the next Farm Bill, to individual programs. Representing the needs of my constituents remains my top priority, and I'm appreciative of all who came out to talk about how we can best support our farmers and growers. Radio Interview with KFGO [cid:image007.png@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] I was a guest on KFGO News and Views with Joel Heitkamp on Thursday morning to talk about how the United States is facing an unprecedented opioid epidemic. It is critical that Congress develops effective policy to combat addiction. The opioid epidemic needs our immediate attention, and I am committed to ensuring that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice are equipped to fight it. You can listen to our discussion online here. Felling Trailers [cid:image008.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] My staff met with members of the National Association of Trailer Manufacturers (NATM) this week. Pat Joenniseen of Felling Trailers in Sauk Centre highlighted the recurring challenges of finding and hiring skilled workers. In order for our businesses to expand, they need assurance that there will be skilled workers to hire. This is a common fear I hear from business owners in Minnesota. Being that this is a problem fairly unique to Minnesota, we should first look for a solution at the local level. A coordinated effort by the state, schools, unions, and businesses will be required in order to solve our shortage of skilled workers. I look forward to continuing conversations on supporting our local businesses. Cooperative Health Plan for Farmers [cid:image009.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] This week, my staff was briefed on a new Cooperative Health Plan for Farmers by 40 Square Cooperative Solutions. 40 Square is a cooperative dedicated to providing health plan options owned and governed by Minnesota farm families and the agricultural community. You can learn more on their website. Minnesota Department of Human Services [cid:image010.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] My staff attended Department of Human Services \"Connections: Community Listening Event\" discussing the needs in the community in the area of Mental Health, Housing, and Addictions. Information gathered at these sessions with help determine future efforts to supporter healthier communities. United Way of Southwest Minnesota [cid:image011.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] My staff aide, Meg Louwagie, participated in the United Way of Southwest Minnesota's joint effort with Jumpstart's \"Read for the Record\" nationwide campaign. The campaign aims to draw attention to the importance of early literacy by mobilizing adults and children to set a record for the largest shared reading experience. You can learn more online here. [cid:image012.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80]Legislative Update This week, the House passed two pieces of legislation targeted at increasing transparency in federal government settlements and to stop the \"sue and settle\" process of agency activism. One of these included the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, which I was the lead Democratic sponsor. The legislation seeks to stop the practice of the DOJ requiring donations to be directed towards certain groups, often politically motivated, as part of settlements. Finally, the House passed the Senate's budget, which I voted against. This budget will increase the debt by over $1.5 trillion, and I cannot support a bill so financially irresponsible. [cid:image013.gif@01D34F3F.05ABDE80]Newsstand National FFA Convention The 90th National FFA Convention will be held in Indianapolis this week. More than 64,000 FFA members from across the country are expected to attend the event.

This was a District Work Week and I spent time traveling around our community to make site visits and meet with constituents.   I took this photo along the way: French Creek at Sheeder Hall Bridge, East &amp; West Vincent Township, Chester County Since coming to office in 2015, I have heard from constituents, first responders, treatment facility officials, nurses, doctors, and many others who are working to combat the opioid epidemic both locally and nationally. I have utilized their feedback and worked to fight this epidemic&nbsp;through legislation, by ensuring first responders and others facing the epidemic on the front lines&nbsp;have adequate resources, by visiting treatment centers in the community, and by supporting the 21st&nbsp;Century Cures Act, which&nbsp;provided $1 billion&nbsp;in funding for states to fight the opioid epidemic - including $26 million for Pennsylvania alone. As you may have read, or seen on 60 Minutes, the intent and focus of legislation regarding the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that was signed into law in 2016 was recently the subject of a Washington Post story.This bipartisan legislation first passed through the Energy and Commerce Committee&#8217;s Health Subcommittee and the full Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously in 2014 and 2015 before it passed both the House and Senate unanimously -in fact, it passed the House unanimously in 2014, 2015, and 2016- and was signed into law by the Obama Administration without any stated objection from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).&nbsp;To be clear,&nbsp;this bill went through regular order, and technical assistance was provided by the DEA and Department of Justice (DOJ).&nbsp;Here is an op-ed&nbsp;by Senator Hatch which reflects the facts and the context surrounding passage of the bill. The legislation&#8217;s clear and stated intent was to have the DEA and distribution companies establish a clear understanding of enforcement standards, allowing for greater collaboration among stakeholders to address modern challenges to prescription drug abuse, while still allowing patients&nbsp;with medical needs to have reasonable access. I have stated that if the purpose of the law is now&nbsp;not&nbsp;being realized, then we need to&nbsp;fix it. I am in the process of investigating and evaluating this, and preparing questions to the DEA to get answers. I believe many others are as well, especially given it was unanimously supported by the entire Congress and signed into law by President Obama. On Wednesday, October 25, I will have the opportunity to hear directly from the DEA during a full Energy and Commerce Committee hearing. I will be sure to provide an update from the hearing. Keep reading for a full update on my week. October 16 &#150; October 20: Local Efforts to Keep Our Community Safe &amp; Healthy Week Without Domestic Violence I joined the YWCA Tri-County on Thursday for its Open House for National Week Without Violence -&nbsp;a nationwide effort to raise awareness on the impact of violence in our communities. I believe it is critical to&nbsp;advocate for healthy and safe communities, which is why I support efforts in Congress on these important issues:&nbsp;  Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act: This legislation reauthorizes the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program, which relies on evidence-based measures by ensuring grantees of the program are making progress in several areas, including improvements in maternal health, improvements in self-sufficiency, reduction of child abuse, and reducing domestic violence. Under the bill, states must provide certain information to show this progress.&nbsp;   International Violence Against Women Act: This bill would&nbsp;create an&nbsp;Office of Global Women&#8217;s Issues within the U.S. Department of State. In addition, this legislation would establish a Senior Coordinator for Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s Empowerment within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). If enacted, these programs would be directed to coordinate U.S. foreign policy with respect to the global prevention of violence against women and girls. This legislation would help promote gender integration on an international scale, especially in countries where women are denied basic human rights, starved of opportunity, and unjustly targeted as victims of discrimination and abuse.   PAWS Act: This bill would amend federal criminal law to include threats or acts of violence against an individual&#8217;s pet under the offenses of stalking and interstate violation of a protection order.&nbsp;In addition, this legislation would authorize the U.S. Department of Agriculture to award grants to local stakeholders to develop programs to provide housing assistance, support services, and training for victims of domestic violence and their pets.  I also sent a bipartisan letter with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-MI) to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, urging her to maintain Title IX guidance in K-12 schools that protects young people from sexual assault and harassment. Our schools must be prepared to protect students from sexual assault and violence, which is why maintaining current guidance to make sure schools know their responsibilities and commit to them is so important. The lasting consequences for victims of sexual assault can be wide-ranging, which is just one of the reasons why we must ensure schools support completing training and education to provide an environment safe from sexual violence. You can read the letter here. When Secretary DeVos announced the Department would rescind Title IX guidance, I issued the following statement: At the very least, parents expect Pennsylvania&#8217;s K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to be safe learning environments for our students, and Title IX helps uphold this standard. Any threats to a safe and healthy learning environment &#150; especially sexual misconduct &#150; must be taken seriously and addressed swiftly and fairly. I am concerned by Secretary DeVos' decision today to formally rescind the 2011 Title IX guidance document issued by the Department of Education that protects young people from sexual assault and harassment. I will continue paying close attention to the Department&#8217;s actions as it reevaluates existing guidance to improve due process under the law. Any new guidance must maintain strong protections for victims, further clarify the responsibilities of schools under Title IX, and more effectively prevent sexual assault on campus. Infrastructure In Our Community  This week, I visited Poplar Neck Bridge in Cumru Township to meet with officials from the American Public Works Association (APWA) and local officials about infrastructure needs. In Congress, I co-chair the Public Works and Infrastructure Caucus &#150; a bipartisan forum to advance discussion and efforts on the need for greater investment in our nation&#8217;s infrastructure, including public works. I believe our Caucus can play a vital role in advocating for a comprehensive infrastructure package and serving as a strong advocate for public works throughout that process. Public works professionals are the first line of defense in weather emergencies and natural disaster to make sure our roads are safe and clear for first responders &#150; and who provide vital services we all depend on day in and day out, regardless of where we live. Equifax Update As I continue to hear from constituents affected or concerned by the data breach at Equifax, caseworkers at my offices in West Chester and Wyomissing are available to provide assistance for residents of Pennsylvania's Sixth Congressional District. As a reminder, you may also visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website for assistance by clicking here. I am also&nbsp;continuing to work on this issue in Congress: This week,&nbsp;along with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I&nbsp;sent&nbsp;a letter to the General Services Administration&nbsp;(GSA) requesting information on GSA&#8217;s data security evaluations when considering and awarding federal contracts.&nbsp;The Committee was made aware GSA had previously awarded federal contracts to Equifax, including for data work with the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.&nbsp;  Companies that handle consumers&#8217; personal information as part of their work with the federal government must demonstrate an ability to protect this sensitive information as part of the contract application process - no excuses.&nbsp;Similarly, federal agencies vetting potential contractors should have a strong confidence in those companies&#8217; ability to securely guard such information. I also recently signed onto a letter sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that questioned the decision by the IRS to continue its contract for data services with Equifax even after the breach. The IRS has since suspended the contract. Click here to read the letter to GSA and click here to read the letter to the IRS.&nbsp;I will continue to keep you updated on this issue.  Constituent Service Announcements Pottstown Office Hours  Did you know my office holds Community Office Hours at the Pottstown Library? A member of my staff will be in Pottstown on the first and third Thursday of each month, and is available to meet with constituents between 11:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Spotted Lanternfly I have been hearing from constituents about the Spotted Lanternfly, a pest that could negatively impact the operations of farms in our area, particularly in Berks County, as well as recreation and daily routines for constituents. Earlier this year, Pennsylvania received federal funding through the Farm Bill to help respond to the Spotted Lanternfly. I am currently working with federal officials at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on how we can provide effective assistance. If you need immediate assistance regarding the pest, or have questions, please&nbsp;click here&nbsp;for additional information.&nbsp; October: Breast Cancer Awareness Month This year, approximately 246,600 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer. In Pennsylvania, approximately&nbsp;30 new cases are diagnosed each day.&nbsp;With the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimating that 1 in 8 women will receive a breast cancer diagnosis at some point during her lifetime, we all know someone who has been affected. As we recognize&nbsp;Breast Cancer Awareness Month&nbsp;this October as part of the nationwide effort to support those who have been impacted by breast cancer and to raise awareness to improve early detection, I wanted to tell you about my efforts in Congress to combat this disease:  Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act:&nbsp;This bill would take steps to identify opportunities and ideas within government and the private sector that have not yet been utilized but could be very helpful in the work to end breast cancer.   Breast Cancer Patient Education Act: This bill would take steps to better inform breast cancer patients of treatment and recover options.   Protecting Access to Lifesaving Screenings (PALS) Act: This bill would help women maintain access to essential breast cancer screenings, regardless of their age.  I have also worked to gain the support of a bipartisan group of my colleagues to advocate for robust funding for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program during the appropriations process and will be sure to share the letter with you once it has been sent. Next week, the House will be in session for votes, Committee business, and constituent meetings. Sincerely,  Ryan Costello Member of Congress &nbsp; &nbsp;           The Alexander-Murray plan, a bipartisan health plan announced this week in the Senate, would provide for two years of cost-sharing reduction payments, a new plan level that allows for catastrophic insurance, an increase in state flexibility through certain waivers, and fiscal responsibility through a \"zero score.\"&nbsp;What are your thoughts on this plan?I support parts of the plan, but I still want to see the Affordable Care Act (ACA) repealed and replaced. I support parts of the plan and believe additional fixes are necessary, but we should keep the ACA. I support parts of the plan, but I still believe single-payer is the way forward. I do not support any parts of the plan announced this week and believe the only solution is to repeal and replace the ACA. I do not support any parts of the plan announced this week and believe the only solution is a single payer healthcare system. I do not support any changes to the ACA. I'm not sure      Here I am visiting the YWCA Tri-County on Week Without Violence for the YWCA's open house - a nationwide effort to raise awareness on the impact of violence in our communities. In this photo, I am with&nbsp;Stacey Woodland, Chief Executive Officer. Click here to watch WFMZ's coverage of the open house.  I joined the Greater Berks Food Bank (GBFB) this week for the World Food Day Breakfast - an opportunity to thank the dedicated volunteers, staff, and supporters and raise awareness of the importance of addressing hunger. It may be hard to believe food insecurity exists in your own backyard &#150; but thirteen percent of the population in Berks County lives in poverty and can face food insecurity &#150; including many children. We must raise awareness and advocate for solutions to this problem, and GBFB is playing an important role in helping the community. Click here for more information.  Constituents with the Recording Academy visited my office to talk with me about music licensing.  Katherine, a member of my Washington, D.C. staff, met with Ayanna Mitchell, a student at Pottsgrove High School and Pennsylvania&#8217;s Student Ambassador with Fuel Up To Play 60. Ayanna shared her day-to-day responsibilities with the FUTP60 program and how she engages with other students, teachers, school administrators, and cafeteria staff to promote health and wellness at school. She was recently awarded a $1,000 grant for her proposal to reduce food waste in school cafeterias. Congratulations, Ayanna, and thank you for taking the time to visit my office to share your ideas on issues of importance to you and your fellow students!   As part of an effort to bring new residents and work opportunities to Pottstown, the Pottstown Industrial Development Authority and other community organizations brought together dozens of business owners, residents and community leaders to record a promotional video touting the community&#8217;s civic pride, along with the slogan, I Pick Pottstown.  Meeting with doctors and healthcare professionals at Reading Hospital to listen to their concerns about improving access and quality of care for their patients.  Exciting day for students, staff, school board and the community as Boyertown Area School District formally unveiled renovated high school after a three-year building project. Beautiful fall afternoon to celebrate and get a look at all the hard work that went into making a great school even better.  I met with the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants to discuss tax reform and other legislative priorities. ICYMI: Pottstown Mercury:&nbsp;Rep.

Dear Friend,  Opioid pain killer abuse kills some 33,000 Americans every year, and I&#8217;m strongly supporting legislation to immediately repeal a bad law that has made the opioid crisis even worse. Under the guise of ensuring adequate supplies to patients who actually require these powerful medications, the 2016 law has made it tougher for federal enforcement agencies to crack down on drug companies and distributors that ship opioids illegally to turn huge profits. According to a blockbuster investigation by the Washington Post and 60 Minutes, these shipments have flooded areas of the Nation hardest hit by the opioid abuse epidemic. So in addition to repealing the 2016 law, our new measure restores the federal Drug Enforcement Agency&#8217;s (DEA) full authority to suspend the licenses of unscrupulous distributors of opioids and other prescription drugs.&nbsp; Last week, President Trump&#8217;s nominee to be the Nation&#8217;s &#8220;Drug Czar,&#8221; Republican Congressman Tom Marino, was forced to withdraw from consideration following news reports that he had received substantial campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry&nbsp;while helping lead the 2016 measure to passage by the House. In fact, according to the Post-60 Minutes report, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than $100 million lobbying Congress and delivering campaign contributions between 2014 and 2016. This is just one more example of the toxic effects of special interest money on our public policymaking process. That&#8217;s why my Restore Democracy legislation calls for getting toxic special interest money out of politics. We need to restore integrity to a system that has increasingly become rigged for the rich and powerful.  As this opioid situation so clearly illustrates, bad public policy fueled by special interests and their campaign dollars not only hurts our Nation &#150; but can also cost lives. The American people deserve better from their elected leaders.  We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email. Sincerely,   International Falls Military Veterans Roundtable Highlights Need to Reform Veterans Choice Program&nbsp;   Click on the photo above for a video summary of the packed military Veterans roundtable Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz and I hosted last Friday in International Falls. Congressman Walz, to my left in this picture, is the highest ranking enlisted person ever to serve in Congress. No military Veteran should ever have to make a 600-mile round trip from International Falls to Minneapolis for routine medical care. That, in a nutshell, was the message Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz and I heard last week from Veterans Service Officers, health care providers, and military Veterans who attended our Veterans Choice roundtable on Friday in International Falls.&nbsp;  The Veterans Choice program to provide rural military Veterans with top quality local medical care &#150; without having to travel long distances to VA health care facilities &#150; is a great idea. But Veterans Choice is not working as intended. Rules and regulations are confusing. Providers are leaving the system because of trouble getting paid. And it takes too long to schedule appointments. So we need to be bold, creative, and open to new ideas in order to fix Veterans Choice and get it right.&nbsp;  As we pointed out during the meeting, the Veterans Affairs Administration (VA) has just submitted its latest version of Veterans Choice reform legislation to the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees - an update which is meant to eliminate the current long wait times and distance requirements that have frustrated so many military Veterans and their families.  Congressman Walz is the Ranking Member (Democratic equivalent of Chairman) of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, and I&#8217;ll be working closely with him on bipartisan legislation to provide better and more accessible local health care to all our military Veterans in Minnesota and across our Nation.&nbsp;   Military Veterans and their families packed our Veterans Roundtable in International Falls to relay their experiences with the Veterans health care system and advocate for reform of the Veterans Choice program to provide local care in rural areas.&nbsp;  21st Century Cures Act Just One Step Forward To Better Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment&nbsp;   Wherever I go across Minnesota&#8217;s rural 8th District, families, patients, community leaders and mental health professionals emphasize the need for more mental health resources for diagnosis, treatment and support.&nbsp; By almost any definition, mental health problems here in America have reached epidemic proportion &#150; a major factor in opioid abuse and addiction, alcoholism, domestic abuse, crime, homelessness, unemployment and suicide. According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, more than 43 million people experience some kind of mental health issue in any given year.&nbsp;  Make no mistake &#150; we are making progress. The 21st Century Cures Act signed into law in 2016 contains a provision I cosponsored &#150; the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act &#150; that has been called the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.  Specifically, the Cures Act provides money and support to better train teachers, law enforcement, and first responders to recognize the symptoms of mental illness and de-escalate crises. Thanks to the Cures Act, there are more resources to keep people with mental illnesses out of jail, and more psychiatric hospital beds once they get into treatment. The law also provides for better oversight of the insurance industry to ensure that mental illnesses are treated like any other medical condition.&nbsp;  But as I pointed out to the hundreds who attended last week&#8217;s Pine County Mental Health Forum in Hinckley, we still have a long way to go to bring mental health issues out into the open, and encourage people to seek treatment. Only about 40 percent of the people who need treatment actually receive it. According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, that figure translates into annual lost earnings topping $193 billion. And tragically, more than 90 percent of young people who die by suicide have a mental health condition.  Wherever I go across Minnesota&#8217;s rural 8th District, families, patients, community leaders and mental health professionals emphasize the need for more mental health resources for diagnosis, treatment and support. And more bed and facilities for people in crisis, so they can be treated close to home near their families and loved ones. That will be my focus in Congress as we strive to make life better for people who are troubled and in need. &nbsp;  Paws &amp; Claws in Hackensack Joins Nationwide Rescue of Pets Made Homeless by Hurricanes&nbsp;   At the Paws and Claws Rescue and Resort in Hackensack, owners Betty and Jack Thomas introduced me to Bruiser, a boxer mix puppy displaced when Hurricane Harvey struck Texas earlier this fall.&nbsp; This fall&#8217;s devastating hurricanes have left countless numbers of pets homeless, and Betty and Jack Thomas, owners of the Paws and Claws Rescue &amp; Resort in Hackensack, have joined folks all over the country to help them out. In addition to providing adoption, foster care and boarding for local dogs and cats, as well as volunteer, educational, and employment opportunities for Cass County animal lovers, Betty and Jack have accepted ten dogs separated for their families when Hurricane Harvey struck Texas.  When I visited Paws and Claws last week, Betty and Jack introduced me to the little guy in the photo above. His name is Bruiser, and he&#8217;s a boxer mix puppy. He sure is cute. And he&#8217;s also a reminder of the lasting damage that terrible storms bring upon communities. Though the hurricanes have past, an incredible amount of work needs to be done. And as I have pointed out before, Congress must immediately provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with all of the resources and support necessary to help restore Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida. Tens of thousands of people are still struggling to rebuild their homes, regain access to power and clean drinking water and - for some - to find their lost pets.  Thanks to Betty and Jack and folks like them, thousands of homeless pets are finding safe haven, and as many as possible are being reunited with their families. You can find more information on how to help by clicking HERE. &nbsp;  GOP Opens the Way for $1.5 Trillion Tax Boondoggle to Make the Rich Even Richer - Working Families Would Pay the Bill&nbsp;&nbsp;   House and Senate Republicans have passed a budget resolution that opens the way for an enormous tax cut for super-wealthy individuals and corporations - paid for by working families. Republicans leaders have again demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to hand millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations a $1.5 trillion tax cut paid for by working families. Paving the way for the GOP&#8217;s phony so-called &#8220;tax reform&#8221; bill, Senate Republicans last week passed a $4 trillion budget resolution that would blow up the deficit and roll back Social Security, Medicare, and an entire century of American progress. On the chopping block are good paying jobs, clean air and water, lifesaving medical research, pensions and retirement benefits, health care and transportation &#150; just to name a few.  As I have pointed out before, the Republican budget plan sets the stage for dismantling Social Security and Medicare - turning Social Security over to Wall Street bankers and Medicare over to the costly private insurance industry. Medicare benefits would be cut by half a trillion dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Medicaid &#150; which millions of elderly nursing home patients, disabled children, rural hospitals and others depend on for support &#150; would be decimated with a trillion dollar cut. Now the GOP Senate measure goes back to the House, where Republican leaders will do their utmost to rubber stamp it. Mark my words &#150; I will continue to fight this every step of the way. And I&#8217;ll be working for a much better budget that invests in America, in people and good paying jobs, and in opportunities for the middle class.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Our Week in Cook   It was a tremendous honor for me to present 96-year-old World War II Navy Veteran Leo Hiveley with several medals he earned in service to our Nation. The medal pinning ceremony took place at the Cook VFW on Friday afternoon. A mix-up way back in 1945&nbsp;prevented Leo from receiving the honors at that time, and I&#8217;m so proud that our Congressional office was instrumental in&nbsp;rectifying the situation so he could receive them in front of so many friends and members of his family. Our Week in Minneapolis   My daughter Katherine and I were honored to represent A Breath of Hope Lung Foundation at a special luncheon sponsored by the Minnesota Vikings and the American Cancer Society to honor cancer survivors and caregivers. Here we are with Viking team member Jaleel Johnson, one of many players we met at this wonderful event. Our Week in International Falls   Before our Veterans Roundtable with Congressman Tim Walz, I sat down for an interview with host Duane Etienne at KSDM/KGSM Radio.   During our tour of the beautiful new terminal at International Falls Airport, I had the opportunity to meet with the TSA Homeland Security agents who do such great work to ensure the safety of passengers and employees alike. I&#8217;m proud to say that our office helped secure $3 million in federal funding for this facility, which will help boost good paying jobs, commerce and tourism throughout the Borderland.&nbsp; Our Week in Blackduck   We enjoyed a warm welcome from the 300 employee owners of Anderson Fabrics, Blackduck&#8217;s largest employer - and the largest custom fabrics design and craft center in the Nation. Blackduck Mayor Rudy Patch and City Administrator Christina Regas joined us on Thursday afternoon for the tour.&nbsp; Our Week in Crosby &nbsp;  I&#8217;m working hard in Congress to increase funding for medical research to help better diagnose, treat and ultimately find a cure for Type 1 Diabetes. So it was a real inspiration to meet with Crow Wing Commissioner Doug Houge, who has launched the &#8220;Because of Brandon&#8221; campaign to help find a cure and boost awareness of this condition. Doug lost his son, Brandon, to type 1 diabetes in 2015. For the past two years, he has worked to raise more than $90,000 to send children with this disease to a special summer camp, and to help parents transport their kids to doctor visits in the Twin Cities. Doug is pictured here along with Jayce, a Type 1 Diabetes survivor who is helping advance the Because of Brandon organization. Our Week in Duluth   The Duluth Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s 147th Annual Meeting on Thursday night. The speaker was our friend Khawar Nasim, Consul General of Canada stationed in Minneapolis.&nbsp; Mr. Nasim spoke about the important trade relationship that Canada and the United States share. Canada is Minnesota&#8217;s largest trading partner. Anyone who spends anytime in Duluth, on the Iron Range or North Shore, has seen all of those Canadian license plates and knows what a positive impact our friends to the North have on our economy.&nbsp; When we talk about fair trade and free trade, we need to make sure we protect our good relationship with Canada. Our district director, Jeff Anderson, attended the event on my behalf.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Members of the Baha'i in the Northland gathered over the weekend to celebrate the 200th anniversary of their faith, and Nolan Congressional staffer Brynn Sias joined them on my behalf.&nbsp; I was proud to co-sponsor a House Resolution this year condemning the Government of Iran for their state-sponsored persecution of their Baha'i minority. Our Week in Pequot Lakes   Highway 317 is open! Staff from MnDOT, Mathiowetz Construction and WSB Engineering were on hand to celebrate the completion of the Highway 371 expansion project. In this picture, Pequot Lakes Mayor, Nancy Adams, cuts the ribbon to officially open the highway. Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the event on my behalf. Our Week in Hackensack &nbsp;  At the Paws and Claws Rescue &amp; Resort, my old friends Jack and Betty Thomas, who operate this wonderful facility, introduced me to Eddie, a rescue cat they have adopted as their own. Eddie is one lucky guy!&nbsp;  Our Week in Littlefork   We stopped in Littlefork on Thursday for a tour of the Littlefork/Rainy Lake Medical Center and meeting with the staff to discuss rural health care issues. Pictured here with me are Stephanie Fairchild, Dietary Manager; Geoffrey Ryan, Regional Director St. Francis; Carrie Claybuny, Associate Administrator; Deputy Mayor of Littlefork Loren Lehman; Ron Manka, Director of Maintenance. Our Week in Hinckley   These Green Bay Packer fans were among the several hundreds folks who attended the Pine County Mental Health Forum last Tuesday in Hinckley.&nbsp;  Coming Up in Washington  This week: The House is expected to take up the fiscal 2018 budget resolution that the Senate adopted last week. If the House green lights what the Senate sent over, the Senate would be able pass their tax overhaul for the wealthy with a simple majority.  Finally...

[link 1] This week, the House will vote on three bills and a resolution to hold Iran accountable for their growing threat to the U.S. and the entire world. The *Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act [link 2]*takes a proactive approach focused on countering the Iranian regime's aggression - particularly its support for terrorism - by holding those individuals, foreign companies, and banks involved in Iran's dangerous missile development accountable for helping Iran expand its ballistic missile program. These sanctions will ultimately shut down Iran's ballistic missile development by cutting off the financial backing by penalizing those who trade conventional weapons with Iran in violation of international trade restrictions. As part of the package of bills to hold Iran accountable, the House will vote on two bills to sanction the militant group Hezbollah, which is a leading Iranian proxy for terrorism. The Hezbollah has carried out horrible acts of violence and undermined our interests in Syria and has threatened our greatest ally, Israel. *The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendment Act [link 3]*will increase sanctions on the terrorist organization and will target Hezbollah's Fundraising and recruiting efforts, including its attempts to crowdsource small donations to support its fighters. The Hezbollah has been known to use men, women, and children as human shields. The *Sanctioning Hezbollah's Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act * [link 4]will sanction Hezbollah commanders responsible for ordering or directing the use of human shields, and will extend sanctions to anyone who provides material support to those involved in this human rights abuse. [image = [link 5] * Around the District* * Engines of Economic Growth: Tax Reform, Regulatory Reform, Smart Investments* [image = Kevin speaking with the Lenexa Chamber of Commerce last week. It was great to join the *Lenexa Chamber of Commerce* last week to give an update on what we're doing in Congress - what we've done so far and what we are planning to do in the coming months. This year, we've renewed focus on our veterans and military by passing dozens of bills like the *VA Accountability Act * [link 6]and *Forever GI Bill* [link 7] to help our nation's veterans get the care and benefits they need. We've passed legislation to increase funding for crucial programs across the country like *National Institutes of Health (NIH)* and *Head Start*, and increased funding to our national defense and border security. We've also focused on growing the economy and creating jobs - and today more Americans have jobs now than ever before. But there's more that we can do as we begin to look ahead to tax reform. [image = [image = Click here to read more from the *Wall Street Journal* about the next steps for tax reform. [link 8] The free enterprise system is the greatest poverty program in human history, which has lifted up more people around the world than any government program. By updating our broken tax code as a part of our larger economic agenda, American families will have more freedom and opportunities. A combination of smart investment, fewer regulations, and simpler and fairer taxes will help us achieve the jobs and wage growth that we've been looking for but failed to reach over the last ten years. It means millions of additional jobs and millions of people rising out of poverty over the next decade. * What Does 4% Growth Mean for America?* - 10 million additional jobs during the next decade. - More than $3 trillion in additional revenue over the coming decade without tax increases. - 30% reduction in the 10-year budget deficit. - 3 million people would rise out of poverty over the next decade. - Reduce the burden on government safety nets by $200 billion. [image = [link 9] * Kansas City Kansas Chamber of Commerce* [image = Kevin meeting with local small business owners in KCK at a roundtable discussion. Small businesses make up about 99.7 percent of all firms that employ at least one person in America, and more than six in ten new jobs come from small businesses. In fact, if every small business in America created one new job, we'd have economic growth that we haven't seen in many years - even decades. That's why, as we consider tax reform, we're making sure to prioritize letting you keep more of your hard-earned money so that you can start that small business you've always wanted to. And once you do start it, we want to make sure you'll be afforded the opportunity to help it grow and thrive. Last week, I met with local small business owners in KCK at a roundtable discussion hosted by the *Kansas City Kansas Chamber of Commerce*, where we discussed a host of issues they face when dealing with government regulations and mandates and the complexity of our current tax code. It's meetings like these that are the most helpful for me to take back to Washington, to help my colleagues in Congress craft the best possible tax legislation to help get our economy moving again. Thanks to Daniel Silva from KCK Chamber and Valerie Mussett from Design Mechanical for leading discussion. [image = [link 10] * Kansas State Board of Education Meeting* [image = Kevin addressing the Kansas State Board of Education last Tuesday. Thank you to the *Kansas State Board of Education* for inviting me to take part in your monthly meeting last Tuesday to discuss federal education issues. During the meeting, we talked about the need to provide our students with the tools and training they need to be successful in the long run. In Congress, I have been working to help Kansas and other states have the resources they need to better prepare students for their careers and post-secondary education like *TRIIO*,* **GEAR Up*, the *Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act* [link 11]. I voted to reauthorize the Perkins Act, which is the primary source of federal funding for states to develop academic, career, and technical skills of secondary and postsecondary students. The state of Kansas received $10.2 million in Perkins grants this year. I have also been a strong advocate for quality childcare or education programs like *Head Start* to get ahead of their peers who don't have those benefits - and evidence shows that they stay ahead of the curve throughout their educational careers. Earlier this year, I even introduced my own bill, called the *PACE Act* [link 12], which will expand child care tax credits to help more working parents afford high quality childcare for their kids. My bill will make this tax credit fully refundable - which means that low income families stand to gain the most from the PACE Act. Special thank you to Commissioner Watson for the presentation on Kansans Can and for your leadership on hard work of preparing our students to become the next generation of workers and citizens. I look forward to hearing more of your thoughts, along with the rest of the Kansas State Board of Education, on federal education issues and appreciate the chance to have this discussion. Thank you also to the Board for your service, and to Board Member Janet Waugh from KCK for the invitation. [image = [link 13] * Shawnee Mission School District Center for Academic Achievement* [image = Kevin with Shawnee Mission School District Board Member Patty Mach at the Grand Opening. The state of Kansas - and specifically the Third District - has some of the best public schools in the nation where students learn from the most well-prepared teachers in America. On Thursday, I attended the Grand Opening of the *Shawnee Mission School District Center for Academic Achievement*, where I saw how SMSD is taking steps to continue to be one of our nation's finest public school districts. The Center for Academic Achievement houses the district's Academic Signature Programs, which include a simulation hospital, the Bistro - an award winning student-run restaurant, a Project Lead the Way Engineering maker space, and a biotechnology laboratory. This building also has meeting spaces for members of the community, and the district's administrative offices. Congratulations to SMSD on the opening of this outstanding facility. Thank you SMSD Interim Superintendent Dr. Kenny Southwick, the SMSD Board of Education for your leadership, and to all SMSD administrators, teachers, students and community for your investment in our future. [image = [link 14] * Girl Scouts Troop 2053* [image = Kevin with Girl Scouts Troop 2053. Thank you to the ladies of the *Girl Scouts Troop 2053* out of *Prairie Center Elementary School *in Olathe* *for inviting me to visit with you last week. I enjoyed talking about community service, government - obviously cookies - and did my best to answer some very smart questions from these 4th grade girls! [image = [link 15] * Growing Futures Early Education Center* [image = Kevin talking with preschoolers at Growing Futures Early Education Center. October is *Head Start Awareness Month* - a time to recognize the life changing impact of this program, which serves many Kansas families and children to be prepared for modern education. Last week I enjoyed lunch and conversation with preschoolers at *Growing Futures Early Education Center* in Downtown OP. We talked about their siblings, their pets, and what they want to be when they grow up. They also shared with me all that they are learning, like their numbers and the alphabet, and even let me sing the ABC's with them. I applaud and support Head Start and our early childhood educators who prepare children for Kindergarten. Thank you to Terrie VanZandt-Travis, Executive Director of Growing Futures for the invitation. [image = [link 16] * Connecting for Good* [image = Kevin touring the Connecting for Good facility and meeting with staff to get a better idea of the work they are doing in the community. Access to the Internet is essential in today's modern economy, but isn't always a given for many Americans across the country and some folks right here at home in Kansas City. Internet access brings with it a chance to apply for jobs online, access to virtual library shelves, information about medical and health issues, online education, and more. Thankfully, organizations like *Connecting for Good *exist to help bridge the Digital Divide. Connecting for Good has been operating since 2011 with wireless mesh networks, community technology centers, low cost refurbished PCs and free digital life skills classes in KCK as the only area nonprofit that has digital inclusion as its core mission. Last week, I toured their facility and met with staff to get a better idea of the great work they are doing in our community and understand how I can help them through my work in Congress. Several of the employees are supported through state and local AmeriCorps VISTA grants, which I've supported in my role on the *House Appropriations Subcommittee*.* VISTA* is a national service program that works to eliminate poverty through things like expanding job-training services, combatting homelessness among our veterans, or recruiting disadvantaged youth for computer literacy and coding classes at businesses like Connecting for Good. [image = [link 17] * Grant Schroeder of Shawnee* [image = Kevin with Grant and his brother Collin and sister Olivia. I recently had the honor to meet a local hero, 8 year old Grant Schroeder of Shawnee. Grant saw a need to help the community of Houston following the Hurricane devastation and collected several tons of diapers to be distributed to families in need. Grant has also stepped up to selflessly serve the people of Puerto Rico and has collected several tons of diapers, including water, cereal, paper towels, toilet paper, and cash donations. Tirelessly he has worked with our first responders, the schools in the *De Soto School District* and others to meet the need. Grant, his mom Melissa, brother Collin and sister Olivia stopped by my District Office and Grant told me his story. Thank you Grant for your vision and passion to serve others. You are an inspiration and example to all of us in the 3rd District of Kansas. [image = [link 18] * National Multiple Sclerosis Society* [image = Kevin meeting with Leah Bond, Courtney Eiterich and Dr. Randle Rock discussing Multiple Sclerosis and other debilitating neurological diseases. I continue to support efforts to increase access to affordable health insurance and appreciated the opportunity to meet with members of the Multiple Sclerosis advocacy community this week. We discussed the importance of federal health research taking place at the *National Institutes of Health (NIH)* and my continued efforts in Congress to double the research budget to $2 billion next year. We also must continue working together to implement the provisions included in the *21st Century Cures Act* [link 19], which call for a *National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System *to collect accurate data to further enhance our research efforts and outcomes. Thank you to Leah Bond, Courtney Eiterich and Dr. Randle Rock for your work to advocate on behalf of those battling Multiple Sclerosis and other debilitating neurological diseases. [image = [link 20] * AIPAC Israel Action Forum* [image = Kevin answering questions on a congressional panel with Representatives Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) and Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO). As our closest ally and friend in the Middle East, Israel holds a special place in my heart because of the many values and ideals our two countries share. Congress' work in Washington and our strategic partnership has an immensely positive effect on both of our countries and the entire Middle East region. I will continue to be a steadfast supporter of that relationship, and will continue working closely with my friends at the *American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)* to find new and innovative ways to help ensure the safety and prosperity of our nations. Yesterday, I enjoyed participating in a bipartisan congressional panel with my colleagues Representatives Hartzler and Cleaver, because support for Israel runs across the party divide and we need to continue working together to foster our bond with our allies in Israel. [image = [link 21] * Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Event* [image = Kevin meeting with seniors at the Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Event. At my *Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Event *at the *Olathe Community Center* on Wednesday, I visited with several seniors from the Third District about their Medicare options. I was excited to learn that constituents saved anywhere from $275 to $1,500 per year with our help. Thank you to the dedicated volunteers from the *Senior Health Insurance Counseling for Kansas (SHICK) program* and the *Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services*, who were on hand at the event and provided one-on-one assistance to seniors who had questions or who wished to make changes to their plans. [image = Click here to learn more about the Medicare Open Enrollment Assistant Event on November 8th. [link 22] If you were unable to attend last week's event, I will also be hosting a second Medicare Open Enrollment Assistance Event on November 8th at the *West Wyandotte Library*. For more information, please *click here* [link 23] or contact my District Office in Overland Park at* (913) 621-0832*. As a reminder, the Medicare open enrollment period will end on December 7th and if you would like to consider changes you must do so during this time. [image = [link 24] * Third District Job Fair* [image = Last Thursday was my ninth Third District Job Fair at the *New Century Field House* near Gardner, Kansas. Eighty employers were ready to share with job seekers their available jobs in law enforcement, tech industry, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation industry, financial management, education, food service industry and so much more. Job seekers came dressed for success with resumes in hand and were able to meet with potential employers. [image = Thank you to Keely Schneider, Executive Director and Lars Leininger, Director of *Business Services* and the *Workforce Partnership Team*; and thank you to Jason Camis, Executive Director of the *Gardner* and the first correct response will receive a shout out in next week's newsletter. Congratulations to last week's winner *Jon Bentz*! *Last week's answer:* The AMT was created in 1969 following the public outrage that ensued after then-Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr informed Congress that 155 taxpayers with incomes exceeding $200,000 had paid no federal income tax in 1966. Between 1979 and the late 1990s, only a few hundred thousand taxpayers were affected. The problem is that it was never indexed and now captures millions of middle-class families in its web. As the Tax Policy Center [link 27] notes, \"originally intended to prevent perceived abuses by a handful of the very rich, it now affects roughly 5 million filers.\" * KU Beats Mizzou 93-87* [image = Click for more coverage of yesterday's game.

Sabotage with a Pen Even though he has majorities in both the House and the Senate, President Trump was unable to pass legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Instead, on Thursday he sought to undermine and destroy the ACA through Executive Order. While urging an end to the \"employer mandate\" which requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health coverage at group rates, Trump advanced Association Health Plans (AHPs) where small businesses or other entities could buy health insurance. He claims this will lower premiums. Maybe it will, but not surprisingly, Trump is oversimplifying and leaving out some crucial facts. AHPs could be a reasonable addition to the overall health care discussion. The problem here is that the AHPs Trump will allow would be under no obligation to cover essential benefits as required by the ACA. Essential benefits include everything from pre-natal and postpartum care to mental health and substance abuse treatment. There would also be no obligation to cover pre-existing conditions. This includes anything from asthma and high blood pressure to a previous cancer diagnosis. Younger healthier people may opt for lower premiums and less coverage but if they are faced with accident or illness that coverage won't be enough. Older people or those with disabilities or chronic conditions would be forced into more expensive plans. President Trump also announced late yesterday that the Administration would stop the payments to health insurance companies that help low-income individuals afford coverage. In rejecting this Cost-Sharing Reduction Program (CSR), Trump is again seeking to sabotage the ACA because he has been so ineffective legislatively. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has concluded that stopping these payments will increase health insurance premiums by 20% for many Americans next year alone and increase the federal deficit by $6 billion in 2018. Some companies may also stop participating in the insurance marketplaces because of the volatility. Interestingly, most of this negative impact will occur in the states that voted for Trump! This morning Trump tweeted: \"The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!\" So the President takes a hammer to health care for millions of Americans, including many who voted for him, then calls on Democrats to \"fix\" it. To me - this is the height of hypocrisy and irony! Making America Small Again Today, Trump refused to certify that Iran is living up to their side of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. That is the agreement supported by the ENTIRE WORLD that moved Iran away from building nuclear weapons. This refusal does not itself break the agreement and no one expects Iran will start building nuclear bombs soon. The rest of the world - including ALL of our allies like Britain, France and Germany, and all of our adversaries like Russia and China - have stated their belief that Iran is living up to the deal and their intention to stay true to the agreement. However, Trump does open the door for Congress to take action that might undermine the agreement further and, thereby, challenge Iran to either submit to Trump's unilateral demands or start building bombs. Time will tell if Congress will act foolishly and endanger the world. Trump's action also undermines America's role in the world. Little by little Trump has thumbed his nose at virtually every other country, including our closest allies, and withdrawn from the position we have earned as leader of the free world. His reckless and unilateral actions have grave consequences. Much of the world will come to believe they do not need the USA, cannot trust the USA to stay true to its word, and have, therefore, no good reason to cooperate with us or pay attention to our concerns. How can anyone see this as a good result? I expect to have more to say on this matter as events unfold. More Outrageous Tweets Although I believe President Trump's daily Tweets are primarily intended to distract us from more important business, some of his recent statements I think demand a response. Trump is mad at NBC News for reporting he called for a vast increase in the United States' nuclear arsenal during a summer White House meeting. This is the gathering that prompted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to reportedly call the President a \"moron\" based on his lack of knowledge and understanding about nuclear weapons in today's world. One of his Tweets called out the network and raised the possibility of revoking its broadcast license. This is an outrageous attack on the First Amendment by a sitting President. I am occasionally angered by the media and I think they deserve to be called out when they are wrong or misleading - but every American must accept that the press has a vital role to play in our democracy. Trump took an oath to uphold the Constitution and whether he likes it or not, he has an obligation not only to support, but to champion a free press. Empty threats that clearly violate basic rights protected by the Constitution undermine the Office of the President and offend basic American values. Trump was busy Thursday morning. His threats to essentially abandon Puerto Rico, devastated by Hurricane Maria, are cruel, unconscionable and beneath the dignity of the office he holds. 3.4 million American citizens are struggling to rebuild their lives. Far too many still lack access to clean water and electricity. Medical supplies are scarce and many roads still not operational. In yet another fit of Twitter pique, Trump rants that the United States can't stay and help \"forever\" when it's been just three weeks. This is both a moral failure and an appalling lack of leadership. I wish I could tell you I'm surprised. Disaster Aid Yesterday the House passed the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2266, Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act. It provides emergency aid for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and additional relief for other areas devastated by the recent hurricanes. H.R. 2266 also includes aid for California where residents are battling deadly wildfires. It's not enough, and our fellow citizens will need our support for many months, but it is a necessary down payment. I voted YES. H.R. 2266 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 164 69 0 6 DEMOCRAT 189 0 0 5 TOTAL 353 69 0 11 MASSACHUSETTS 9 0 0 0 Whistleblower Protection Yesterday the House considered S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This legislation increases protections for federal whistle blowers by requiring agency leaders to strengthen disciplinary action when it is determined that supervisors have retaliated against them. I voted YES. S. 585 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 232 0 0 7 DEMOCRAT 188 0 0 6 TOTAL 420 0 0 13 MASSACHUSETTS 9 0 0 0 Behind the Curtain - More House and Trump Administration Actions You Don't Want to Miss Here are this week's additions. If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here. 169: According to October 2017 news reports, the Department of Justice overruled decades of precedent in January, making it possible for President Trump to hire his daughter and son-in-law. Memos from the administrations of Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan and Obama make clear that under a 1967 nepotism law, Presidents cannot appoint their family members to any paid or unpaid positions. The Trump Administration's Justice Department basically threw out all previous legal guidance on nepotism, making it possible for Trump to hire daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, which he did. 170. On October 5, 2017 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) disagreed with the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) decision to allow Equifax to serve as an interim fraud prevention contractor for the federal government. Equifax holds the current contract but another company recently won the bid. Equifax is protesting the loss of the contract and the IRS is now reviewing the process. The GAO maintains that the IRS could have given the interim contract to the company it chose over Equifax as it reviewed the contract awarding process. I am sure you recall that Equifax has been in the news quite a bit lately for a data breach that exposed 145 million consumers' personal information to hackers. Yet the IRS apparently doesn't see the problem with allowing Equifax to continue doing fraud prevention work for the federal government. The GAO argues that the law gives the IRS the authority to award a contract to the winning bidder even if the current contractor is challenging the process under certain circumstances. Certainly, awarding a company that mishandled the personal data of 145 million customers with a fraud prevention contract qualifies. UPDATE: As this newsletter was going through the final editing process, news broke that the IRS finally suspended Equifax's government contract. 171. During a confirmation hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on October 4, 2017, Michael Dourson, who is President Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, refused to definitively state that he would recuse himself from all matters that would conflict with former employment. While this is concerning from an ethical standpoint, it is even more concerning because Dourson founded Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA) where he routinely issued reports favorable to chemical companies. Some of those reports were paid for by chemical companies and TERA regularly issued findings asserting that safety standards for certain pesticides and chemicals should be much lower than current federal and state regulations. It is expected that Dourson will be confirmed by the full Senate, putting him in charge of an office that is involved with protecting the public from pesticide. 172. On October 6, 2017 Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued guidance that greatly expands interpretation of the protections granted religious groups and others when their beliefs are at odds with government regulation. He wrote: \"To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government action, including employment, contracting and programming.\" Given this Administration's previous actions, it's not hard to see an abuse of this directive that discriminates against the LGBTQ community and others. If an employer does not believe in same sex marriage, the AG has basically given that employer license to reject a candidate solely on that basis. 173. On October 9, 2017 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that Administrator Scott Pruitt would take steps to repeal the Clean Power Plan, an Obama Administration rule intended to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. Abandoning this policy shows a cynical disregard for the reality of global warming. It also has health consequences. During the previous Administration, the EPA estimated that the Clean Power Plan could prevent thousands of deaths and reduce asthma attacks in children. 174. In October 2017, the sabotaging of the ACA, as described above. What's up Next Week A district work period will take place. The next House votes are scheduled for Monday October 23rd. **************************** Congressman Mike Capuano 7th District, Massachusetts Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Financial Services District Offices: 110 First Street, Cambridge, MA 02141 Roxbury Community College, Building 2, Room 315, Boston Stetson Hall Room 124, 6 South Main Street, Randolph District Office Phone: (617) 621-6208 DC Office: 1414 Longworth Building, Washington, DC 20515 DC Office Phone: (202) 225-5111 We welcome feedback on our e-updates.

Peterson's Newsletter 9/29/2017","body":"[cid:image001.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Thief River Falls Dear Friends, As Congress begins discussions on the upcoming budget, I continue to visit with Minnesotans about the programs and tax provisions that impact their lives the most. As a CPA, I appreciate the importance of making our system easier, and the possibility to strengthen the economy if tax reform is done right. The impact of tax reform came up a number of times this week as I met with groups on healthcare, education, agriculture, and small business. A few of these groups included the Minnesota Department of Human Resources, the Tri-Valley Opportunity Council, and the National Farmers Union. Sincerely, [cid:image002.png@01D33947.414A83A0] Congressman Collin C. Peterson Minnesota 7th District Minnesota Department of Human Resources [cid:image003.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Emily Piper (Commissioner, Minnesota Department of Human Services) Minnesota Department of Human Resources (DHS) Commissioner Emily Piper visited my office Thursday to discuss the recent approval of Minnesota's waiver application to establish a state-based reinsurance program. While I am happy that progress is being made to help stabilize the state's individual health insurance market, I am concerned by the recent development that funding for MinnesotaCare will significantly decrease as a result. I will work closely with Governor Dayton and the Minnesota Delegation to preserve these critical funds while implementing needed changes to our healthcare system. Minnesota Rural Electric Association [cid:image004.png@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday, I met with a group of Minnesota Rural Electric Association (MREA) members who represent electric cooperatives across the state. The cooperatives provide affordable and reliable electricity, oftentimes to hard-to-reach customers. MREA dedicates significant transmission line infrastructure in rural Minnesota which provides farmers and businesses with access to much-needed power. I support the efforts of MREA and will continue to find ways to represent their needs in Congress. Minnesota Credit Union Network [cid:image005.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Credit unions play an important role in providing the credit rural communities need to thrive. The Minnesota Credit Union Network visited my office and shared their concerns with the cost of complying with regulations which were supposed to target the large banks following financial collapse, and also their concerns about the impact tax reform could have on their operations. With data security in the news, they shared how the cost of a data breach anywhere in the retail sector can impact lenders and their members. We are only as secure as our weakest link, and that is why credit unions favor strong data protection and consumer notification laws for everyone. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers This week, I met with the St. Paul District Army Corps of Engineers for an update on projects in the district. We talked about next steps for Fargo-Moorhead flood protection and the process that will be needed to bring in all stakeholders for a real conversation about solutions. With the injunction in place, I believe that trying to resolve this issue through the courts will waste time and divert resources away from the concrete actions that can bring flood protection to Fargo. I am confident that at the end of the day, everyone is going to have to give a little, but that the entire region will benefit from bringing flood protection to Fargo. As drainage water management and retention projects in the valley move forward, I will continue to work with federal officials to ensure that the flood benefits of these efforts are appropriately considered as a part of the region's flood control strategy. National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association [cid:image006.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Minnesotan representatives of the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association were in Washington this week to share their perspective on infrastructure development and tax reform. As the association works to develop rural communities, it is increasingly important that we improve the roads and bridges that connect them to the rest of the country. Tri-Valley Opportunity Council [cid:image007.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Members of the Tri-Valley Opportunity Council visited my office this week to advocate for the Head Start Program. The education and nutrition services that Head Start provides to children in the 7th District also allows their parents to work, contributing to a strong rural economy. I will continue to support this program in the future. National Farmers Union [cid:image008.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, came by my office on Wednesday to discuss his organization's priories for the farm bill. We discussed the importance of farm programs that appropriately help farmers in difficult times and how we can improve those policies. I look forward to working with Roger and the rest of Farmers Union to build support for the next farm bill. National Association of Wheat Growers [cid:image009.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday, several representatives from the National Association of Wheat Growers, including their president, David Schemm Kansas, met with me to outline their top issues for the farm bill. We agreed that farm programs should reflect the costs farmers incur when growing their crops and that reference prices need to be equitable for all commodities. CFTC Commissioner Behnam [cid:image010.png@01D33947.414A83A0] I met with Russ Benham who was sworn in as a new Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) earlier this month. We discussed his role on the commission, the upcoming agenda for the year, and how the Commission's policies impact farmers. Minnesota Prairie Line Railroad 15 Year Anniversary [cid:image011.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Last Friday, I celebrated with the Minnesota Prairie Line Railroad at their 15-year Anniversary hosted in Franklin. They have a lot to celebrate as their hard work and investments in the railroad over the years have supported shippers and rural communities with many new economic opportunities. I appreciate what they have done for rural agriculture and look forward to their continued success. Consul General of Canada [cid:image012.png@01D33947.414A83A0] I welcomed Consul General Khawar Nasim to my office on Tuesday to discuss important interplay between Minnesota and our neighbors to the North, particularly as Congress continues discussions on trade reform. The US - Canada economic relationship affects Minnesota in many ways, including tourism in the Northwest Angle and our manufacturing and agriculture communities - especially regarding Canada's supply management system in its dairy and poultry sectors. I look forward to continuing these conversations with General Nasim. FDA Duchenne Hearing [cid:image013.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Cheri, Jacob, and Jon Gunvalson (Gonvick) This week, my staff delivered remarks at an FDA advisory committee hearing in support of the accelerated approval of a drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One of my constituents, Jacob Gunvalson, also attended the event to share his experience with the disease and emphasize the urgent need for therapies within the Duchenne community. During my time in Congress, I have consistently supported efforts to ensure that others can benefit from life-saving therapies the way that Jacob has. Ag and Animal Science Conference (AASC) [cid:image014.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday my staff attended the Agriculture and Animal Science Conference in Willmar. The one day conference brought together many of the region's agriculture and animal science stakeholders to listen to local start-ups about their businesses along with industry issues such as marketing, pressures related to GMO and non-GMO labeling, changes in generational labor force, and addressing consumer opinions. The conference brought in engaging speakers and prompted dynamic discussions amongst stakeholders. Minnewaska Community Health Services [cid:image015.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Thursday morning my staff attended the groundbreaking ceremony for Hoffman's new assisted living and memory care facility. A great crowd was on hand to celebrate the momentous occasion. In addition to Hoffman's new building Minnewaska Community Health Services facilities in Starbuck will undergo several renovations. Along with generous donations and community support, these projects will use funding from USDA's Community Facilities program. Minnewaska Community Health Services has come a long way in developing a regional care network, and I commend the hard work that made it all possible. Humane Society [cid:image016.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday, local volunteers from the Humane Society of the United States visited my Detroit Lakes office to share their priorities for Congress. A few of the issues they addressed with my staff were the Horse Soring - Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act, H.R. 1847, the Pets and Domestic Violence - Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act, H.R. 909, and the Dog/Cat Meat Trade - Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, H.R. 1406. National Science Foundation Grant [cid:image017.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Northland Community and Technical College (NCTC) received the National Foundation, Advanced Technology Education (ATE) grant award for $600,000 in partnership with St. Cloud State University (SCSU) for the advancement of geospatial information technology and unmanned aircraft systems education and training. The three year project will focus on developing new capabilities in geographic information science at both institutions while creating educational pathways through dual credit enrollment and 2 +2 articulation agreements for Northland students. NCTC has the only accredited UAS maintenance program in the nation and the first two-year Associate of Arts degree program in Geospatial Intelligence Analysis. Highway 2 West Manufacturers Association [cid:image018.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] The Highway 2 West Manufactures Association held a meeting on Thursday to meet with business leaders of northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. The meeting focused on sharing business experience, learning more about solutions in today's pressing work force, as well as other business issues. The meeting was supported by Anderson Fabrics of Blackduck, which was toured after the meeting. Sam Gould (Enterprise) keynoted the event and discussed employee engagement as an important part of any company's success. I will continue to support our local businesses that play such a pivotal role in keeping our economy strong. Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs 2017 Leadership Conference [cid:image019.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] My staff member Meg Louwagie participated in the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs 2017 Leadership Conference this week held at Camp Rickey Training Center. The Conference brought together numerous groups that work together to support and facilitate programs for our Minnesota Veterans. Fall Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Company Seminar [cid:image020.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] My staff attended the Fall Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Company Seminar held by Prudential Financial. This Seminar brought Yellow Ribbon Companies and Key Support Partners together to discuss best practices for recruiting, hiring and retaining military connected employees and military community support. Grand Forks Air Base Grand Forks Air Force Base Commander COL. Benjamin Spencer met with my military staff aide to discuss the latest development at the Air base. Col. Spencer is the newly appointed commander of the base. As commander, he serves as the senior officer responsible for providing base operating and direct operations support to wing personnel, 2 tenant units and 11 geographically separated units. The wing trains, deploys and redeploys over 1,400 Airmen in support of Air Expeditionary Force and combatant commander requirements. It also provides facilities and equipment support for the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection. The wing is also only one of two locations worldwide operating the High Frequency Global Communications System, providing operational support of senior leader communications for all Department of Defense agencies, including the President of the United States. In addition, the Base provides logistics, civil engineer, contracting, communications, medical, security and force support functions as well as facilities and equipment valued at $2.2 billion and executes a budget of $48 million. [cid:image021.gif@01D33947.414A83A0]Newsstand Remembering Jamie Alan Hyatt On January 7th, 2016, Jamie Alan Hyatt of Wood Lake, Minnesota died attempting to rescue David D. Syring from suffocation in Granite Falls, Minn. I'm honored to share that the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission has given the late Jamie Hyatt the Posthumous Carnegie Hero award. Hyatt's heroic and selfless act will always be remembered. This Week in American History [cid:image022.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On September 28, 1935, Joan Growe was born in Minneapolis. After serving in the Minnesota House of Representatives, she would become Minnesota's secretary of state from 1975 to 1998, making her the first woman elected to statewide office without first having been appointed. A member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, she championed voter and election reform, including such programs as vote by mail and motor voter registration. She held one of the longest tenures for any secretary of state in Minnesota's history. Spotted in the Seventh [cid:image023.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Can YOU guess what was Spotted in the Seventh?

The recovery effort has been very active. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) along with the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and others, are conducting aggressive 24-hour operations, with an array of U.S. government and non-governmental partners, in an ongoing effort to provide immediate assistance to the residents of these two devastated territories. According to FEMA, the top priority of the federal government is continuing to provide life sustaining resources to the islands, bringing additional essential commodities in and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports, and other critical facilities. There are more than 10,000 federal staff representing 36 departments and agencies, including more than 800 FEMA personnel, on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands engaged in response and recovery operations. In Puerto Rico, 56 of 68 hospitals are partially operational, with one fully operational. Additional *National Disaster Medical System* staff arrived Thursday to support hospital assessments and medical needs of those in Puerto Rico. Specific activities in other areas: - Officials in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico opened points of distribution in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for survivors to get meals, water, and other commodities. The Governor of Puerto Rico established 11 Regional Staging Areas around the island, serving 77 municipalities. - FEMA, working in coordination with federal partners, provided millions of meals and millions of liters of water to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Additional meals and water continue to arrive to the islands daily via air and sea. **Life Safety and Life Sustaining** - FEMA Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) visited all 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico conducting search and rescue operations, helping assess hospitals, and distributing commodities. FEMA US&R task forces saved or assisted 843 individuals and five pets, while searching over 2,600 structures. - The DoD continues to operate from Roosevelt Roads Airfield, executing route clearance, commodity and fuel distribution, as well as providing helicopter support to assist officials from *Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)* complete assessments of all Puerto Rican hospitals - The use of medium lift helicopters allows for the flow of needed commodities such as food, water, and fuel to remote areas disconnected from traditional supply lines. Six additional military medium lift helicopters arrived in Puerto Rico to continue commodity distribution to affected areas - The U.S. Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority drinking water system is back online, and other drinking water systems on the islands are top priority for receiving generators - The *National Guard* has thousands of Guard members on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands taking part in security and support operations. The Air National Guard is focused on transporting food, water, and communications capabilities as well as rapidly increasing airlift into affected areas. **Fuel, Transportation, and Debris** - Fifteen *United States Coast Guard *National Strike Force (NSF) teams arrived in PR to conduct post-storm assessments and recovery operations. - The National Business Emergency Operations Center* (NBEOC) is working with private sector companies to reach additional truck drivers throughout Puerto Rico to enable commodities to reach more remote parts of the island. - 11 major roads in Puerto Rico are cleared of debris and back open. - The Federal Highway Administration* (FHWA) made $40 million available to the PR Highways and Transportation Authority (PHRTA) for emergency relief work to impacted roads. - 26 chainsaw teams and one Incident Management Team (IMT) from the Department of Agriculture, United States Forest Service* are in Puerto Rico are conducting emergency road clearance and manage logistics. - *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)* debris experts are assisting FEMA with debris management strategies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with the *Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).* - The federal government is working with its interagency and private sector partners to support availability, transportation and delivery of fuel, based on priorities identified by Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. - The Army Corps of Engineers coordinated transportation of more than 300 FEMA or *Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)* generators from across the U.S. to meet anticipated requirements in the islands. Generators continue to arrive daily to meet temporary power needs. Right now, our fellow Americans are suffering--especially the people of Puerto Rico. We recognize that when crisis hits, every dollar counts and so does every minute. Congress continues to work with the administration to make sure the people of Puerto Rico are getting additional help. While significant progress has been made, full recovery will be very long and very trying. But the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands should be reassured that they are entitled to equal treatment under the law and the Appropriations Committee and House Leadership will assure that every step of the way. It is important to reassure residents and local officials that that we will help them rebuild. And of course, the people of New Jersey remain eager to provide whatever assistance they can. **The fastest way to help** As with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the most effective means to support recovery of communities affected by Hurricane Maria is to donate time or money to trusted voluntary-, faith- and community-based charitable organizations. This gives these organizations the ability to purchase what survivors need right now. In addition, when these organizations purchase goods or services locally, they pump money back into the local and regional economy, helping businesses recover faster. It is important to remember unsolicited donated goods (e.g., clothing, miscellaneous household items, mixed or perishable foodstuffs) require voluntary agencies to redirect valuable resources away from providing services to sort, package, transport, warehouse, and distribute items that may not meet the needs of disaster survivors. **Donate through a trusted organization** The National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) lists trusted organizations receiving donations, many of which are already coordinating relief and response efforts in the Caribbean. The NVOAD website has information on non-profit organizations accepting or registering individual in-kind donations here [link 1]. For corporate donations connect here [link 2]. You may also make financial donations to a National VOAD member organization [link 3] to help voluntary or charitable organizations continue to provide services to Hurricane Maria survivors.

Visit my website to access more information about Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands here: [link 5] *Key Cosponsorships* In addition to the major legislation I have sponsored in the House of Representatives, I also lend my support to other legislation on a range of important issues. Here is a sampling of my recent co-sponsorships: *H.R. 2721 - Seniors' Tax Simplification Act.* The IRS currently prohibits individuals over 65 years old from filing the 1040EZ form even if they have a simple return and choose not to itemize deductions. This bill directs the IRS to create a new tax form, the 1040SR, to accommodate the tax needs of seniors while extending the common sense convenience of the 1040EZ form. This commonsense measure will reduce the burden of filing taxes for senior citizens. *H.R. 1991 - Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act*. This legislation would exempt volunteers providing firefighting or emergency medical services to a state, local government or charity from being counted as full time employees under the Employer Mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As you may remember, the ACA redefined what was considered a full-time employee for the purposes of the employer mandate, which determines whether towns and municipalities must provide health insurance to their workers or pay of fine of as much as $3,000 per employee. *H.R. 3441 - Save Local Businesses Act. * This legislation would clarify that two or more employers must have \"actual, direct, and immediate\" control over employees to be considered joint employers. In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board re-defined the term \"joint employer\" to include employers making a business agreement that \"indirectly\" or \"potentially\" impacts their employees' day-to-day responsibilities and working environment. *H.R. 3165 - Renovate and Enhance Veterans Meeting Halls and Posts (REVAMP).* This bill would authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to provide grants to veterans service organizations for upgrading local chapter facilities, including technology at such facilities. Many New Jersey veterans organizations are struggling with declining memberships and deteriorating post facilities. In the last Congress, I introduced a resolution regarding the eligibility of veterans service organizations for Community Development Block Grants. *H.R.3176 - Disaster Assistance Fairness and Accountability Act*. Under current law, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is permitted to require victims to repay disaster assistance if FEMA changes its determination on their eligibility, even if the payment was already made and the mistake was through no fault of the victim. This process, known as recoupment, is particularly troublesome because there is no statute of limitations on this type of action. H.R. 3176 sets a statute of limitations of three years for disaster recoupment as long as the recipient's application was made in good faith and they provided accurate information, and they did not receive assistance that was out of the range of what they were expecting to receive. The measure does nothing to stop FEMA from recouping money from those who have defrauded the government. *H.R. 2765 - the Perpetual POW/MIA Stamp Act*. This legislation would provide for the issuance of a \"forever stamp\" to honor the sacrifices of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who are still prisoner, missing or unaccounted for. The Department of Defense reports that more than 83,000 service members remain missing since WWII. *H.R 3329 - The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act*. Hizballah is Iran's proxy army across the Middle East. This terror organization poses a direct threat to American interests and Israel, props up the Assad regime in Syria, and has hijacked the Lebanese government. This bipartisan legislation would impose additional sanctions on the terrorist organization and those that support it. For a complete listing of the bills I have sponsored and cosponsored, please visit my website here: [link 6] *Congressman Steve Scalise Comes Back to Serve* The prayers of a nation were answered this week as my colleague, Rep. Steve Scalise, returned to the House of Representatives for the first time since he was gunned down by a would-be assassin on June 14. His bravery and his family's strength have been an inspiration to this House and to all the people it serves. To watch Steve Scalise's stirring return to the House and his plea for unity, [link 7]visit: [link 8] *Bringing Suicide \"Out of the Darkness\"* I was honored to be asked to participate by Mayor Curt Ritter last weekend in Chatham's annual \"Out of the Darkness\" Community Walk where 250 local residents turned out to shine a spotlight on suicide, especially suicide among children. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in America, claiming over 144,000 family members, friends, neighbors, and business associates each year. On average, there are over 120 suicides every day. Most of the people who die by suicide have an underlying mental health illness. In the veterans community, we lose 20 of our comrades each day. These are twenty veterans who have left spouses, mothers, fathers, children, siblings and others wondering why. The VA report indicates that the risk of suicide was 22 percent higher for veterans than those who have not served. But among veterans and those who have not served, we all can make a difference. If you know someone who is showing signs of depression or has talked about suicide, **there are many ways you can help** [link 9]. For example, pay them a visit, meet up for coffee, or invite him or her to participate in a healthy activity like walking or biking. In short: be there. This week concludes National Suicide Prevention Month. But, in reality, it's up to all of us to be on the lookout for anyone possible signs of suicide and take appropriate action.

My thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by these natural disasters. *Visiting with Kansans:* Every month during a district work week I host open office hours in my Topeka office where any constituent can come in for a one on one meeting with me to discuss issues of concern. I had the opportunity to visit with Kansans about a variety of concerns including issues with long term care, healthcare reform and Veterans' benefits. I also enjoyed visiting with the folks from Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved. I always appreciate the opportunity to visit with Kansans on issues that are top of mind. *Touring Topeka Zoo:* Several years ago my office was contacted to assist the Topeka Zoo with some Federal Regulations that were prohibiting the zoo from bringing in an aged authentic safari Land Rover for an exhibit. This week I had the opportunity to tour the zoo and see the vehicle first hand. I enjoyed my tour and appreciate all the folks at the Zoo who work everyday to bring an important service to the families of northeast Kansas.

This local pet shelter does a fantastic job caring for homeless pets. There are great employees and volunteers that work together to make Helping Hands a true success. I appreciate getting to see this passion first hand. [image = *Head Start in Ottawa:* Any day I get to stop in at a Head Start and catch up on what they're doing is a good day. It's always a highlight to see these young kids with bright futures ahead of them and to visit with the wonderful people who are dedicated to helping our future build a solid foundation.

It's truly a privilege to work on behalf of Kansans and I appreciate the kind gesture of this award. [image = *Chamber Congressional Summit:* On Friday I joined several members of the Kansas delegation for a Congressional Summit hosted by the Kansas Chamber. We discussed a wide range of issues that are important to grow the economy and create jobs for Kansans. One of the top items discussed was tax reform. It's very clear Washington needs to get tax reform done so we can create certainty for Americans and allow our job creators to grow their companies and hire more Kansans.

This bill was presented by its proponents as legislation intended simply to enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, fishing, and shooting on public lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, though, the bill contains a long list of anti-conservation measures.  Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this bill, though, is the extent to which it weakens some of our nation&#8217;s most essential common sense gun safety laws. The SHARE act would make silencers&#151;whose sole purpose is to make gunfire harder to detect&#151;easier to obtain. It would also allow some now-illegal armor piercing ammunition to be sold, as long as the ammunition manufacturer labeled it for &#8220;sporting&#8221; purposes. Additionally, the bill would allow gun owners in states with fewer gun safety laws to freely travel with their weapons to states with more stringent gun safety laws. I believe in ensuring that sportsmen and sportswomen can enjoy all the recreational opportunities our public lands have to offer, but this legislation attacks the very conservation laws that protect those federal lands, seriously relaxes commonsense gun safety precautions, and puts lives at risk from gun violence. Click  to watch the statement I made during the Natural Resources Committee&#8217;s Markup of the bill.        The packed house at Tuesday&#8217;s SHARE Act Hearing included a number of members of the gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, who dressed in red.&nbsp;    Hosting a Successful Twitter Town Hall  On Monday night, I had a great time hosting my first ever Twitter Town Hall.

Responding to the Forced Shut-Down of Radio Free Asia in Cambodia Radio Free Asia is an international broadcasting corporation that provides independent news in many countries throughout Asia. This week, under continued threats and provocations from the regime of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the organization was forced to shutter its operations inside Cambodia.  The Hun Sen regime has made it perfectly clear that it has no intention of allowing a free press to exist in Cambodia, and the government appears ready to use any contrivance it can&#151;intimidation, threats, coercion, and even outright violence&#151;to prevent the people of Cambodia from having independent, reliable, and trustworthy news that is not filtered through the Hun Sen lens. The right of political expression, the right of a free media, and the right to dissent, are all being quashed by Hun Sen to subvert free and fair national elections in Cambodia scheduled for next year.  As co-chair of the Cambodia caucus, I  on Wednesday in which I express my concern over the situation and call on the United States Ambassador to Cambodia, as well as the Secretary of State, to take any and all actions necessary to assist the Cambodian people.     Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received numerous calls and letters from people expressing their support for&nbsp;the Pet and Women Safety Act of 2017. Below is a portion of my response to those communications:&nbsp; &#8220;The Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act would protect pets and their owners in homes facing domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It does so by directing the Department of Agriculture to provide grants for housing assistance and support services for domestic violence victims with pets. I believe that victims of domestic violence should not have to worry about the wellbeing of their pets when seeking safety for themselves, and for that reason I am a proud cosponsor of this important legislation. As your representative, I will keep fighting for animal welfare and ensure that our laws provide strong protections for animals and victims of domestic abuse.&#8221; If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.   You can find out how to contact me on my website by . &nbsp;      Regular Order \"Regular order\" refers to the formal processes that govern the House and Senate. It consists of rules and precedents followed with few exceptions when creating or passing legislation. Simply put, regular order means &#8220;the normal legislative process,&#8221; and it goes something like this:   A bill is introduced by its author on the floor of either the House or the Senate. It is given a number and then the majority leadership assigns the bill to a committee--or more than one&#151;that has jurisdiction over whatever the bill covers. For example, a bill about restricting mining on federal lands would be sent to the House Natural Resources Committee (which I sit on).  The chairman of the committee decides whether to consider the bill and when. Public hearings are scheduled in coordination with the ranking (most senior) member of the opposition party on that committee.  Once hearings are complete, the committee chairman brings forward a version of the bill he or she likes and schedules a \"markup\" to consider amendments. Members of the committee--from both parties--offer amendments, debate them, and then vote on them. If the committee votes to approve the bill, the bill then goes to the Floor of the House or Senate for a vote of the full body.   It&#8217;s important to remember that regular order is not just a process, but also a state of mind. Regular order implies that a certain level of comity and bipartisanship is required to govern. This is what has been lost by the abandonment of regular order in recent years.        &nbsp; As you may know, Dreamers are young people who were brought to the country illegally when they were children, often with their parents.

Levin authored a column in the Financial Times sharing the need to shore up labor rights for Mexican workers as a way to help increase the wages of American workers. The column explained that extremely low wages have given Mexico an advantage when it comes to attracting auto manufacturing plants, and that by 2020 it will be the fifth-largest auto producer in the world. There?s no reason such plants shouldn?t be built in the U.S. -- but any new NAFTA must include stronger labor provisions to help that effort. You can read the full column here  . Rep. Levin to CMS: Explain ACA Outreach Cuts Last week, Rep. Levin wrote to Administrator Seema Verma of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding the Trump Administration?s recently announced cuts to outreach programs that support the Affordable Care Act (ACA). On August 31st, Trump Administration officials released a bulletin announcing a 90 percent cut in funding for ACA advertising and educational activities, as well as a draconian new funding formula that will slash grants for ACA Navigator consumer assistance by more than 40 percent. In his letter, Rep. Levin highlighted the harmful impact these cuts would have on Michiganders and consumers across the country, and demanded the Administration provide a detailed explanation for this decision.

Levin Supports DREAMERS While the President has chosen to upend thousands of lives by ending DACA, Rep. Levin continues his support for DREAMers as a cosponsor of the Dream Act of 2017 (H.R. 3440).? The measure would permanently protect DREAMers and allow them to remain in the United States without fear, and work legally to contribute to strengthening the nation they have called home since childhood.? By ending DACA and turning his back on the DREAMers, the President is diminishing the values of our nation and sowing chaos and fear in communities throughout the country.?? This Week on the House Floor: This week, the House continues debate on amendments to a FY 2018 omnibus funding bill (H.R. 3354).? Unfortunately, this bill makes deep cuts that jeopardize women?s health, undermines the Affordable Care Act, compromises environmental protection and restoration, and cuts efforts to upgrade our nation?s infrastructure.? It does not prioritize education, economic development, or job training, and reduces funding streams that support local law enforcement.? The Senate is unlikely to consider this legislation.? The House will also consider legislation that will do little to ensure immigration laws are not exploited by gang members (H.R. 3697).? Instead it could lead to racial profiling, expanded mandatory detention of immigrants, and cause faith-based organizations or faith leaders to be classified as being associated with gangs simply because they aid immigrants regardless of their status, as those missions call on them to care for all in need. ????
