I also announced $4.5 million worth of funding to modernize and expand outdated locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.    Congresswoman Bustos signing legislation to create the Rural Health Liaison.  Health care is the number one issue I hear about from folks back home and in rural communities, access to care can present unique challenges. That&#8217;s why I was proud that on Friday the USDA appointed the first-ever Rural Health Liaison after I passed legislation to create the role. It&#8217;s crucial we ensure small towns across the Heartland have access to 21st Century health care and that&#8217;s what this position will help do. I remain committed to lowering health care costs and improving access, and I look forward to working with our first Rural Health Liaison. You can learn more here.  Then, I joined Senators Durbin and Duckworth to announce $4.5 million worth of funding to improve our locks and dams along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Our inland waterways are responsible for moving more than 600 million tons of goods each year, including agricultural products, but outdated locks and dams could bring this local economic driver to a standstill. This funding will help increase our region&#8217;s competitive edge, promote efficiency and support our local economy. Read more about it here.  Finally, I was proud to vote in favor of women&#8217;s equality when I helped pass a bipartisan resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline Congress previously set to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. With this vote, we take another step forward to guarantee fundamental rights for all and place the ERA on a path to becoming a part of our Constitution.

The budget proposal is pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth and pro-American. The President's budget also includes great news for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP). The budget includes full funding to keep the project on track. This is the fourth year in a row SHEP will receive full federal funding from the Trump Administration, pending Congressional passage of the annual appropriations bill. President Trump has again proven that the Trump administration understands the critical importance of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for our nation. The project is now well past the half way mark. While the finish line is finally in sight, I will continue to fight tirelessly for this federal support and to ensure the project is completed. Also this week, I announced that we secured a federal Department of Transportation grant of $34,600,000.00 for the Port of Savannah. The Port Infrastructure Development Grant is critical to straighten and realign Berth 1, one of the oldest areas of the Port, to increase efficiency. The funding will work to modernize the Berths to handle larger ships. This grant is necessary to ensure the Port is able to handle additional cargo. This announcement goes hand-in-hand with recent news, including the recent land acquisition, to increase port capacity and efficiency. I am excited that this federal funding will work to modernize the port, allow larger ships and increase the amount of cargo they will be able to move. I discussed President Trump's budget and the blockbuster week for the Port of Savannah in this week's edition of Buddy's Briefing. Click here to watch Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCLIII Monday, February 10, 2020: After an early morning flight back to Washington, Im in the House Chamber where I pay tribute to one of my favorite veterans, Paul Grassey from Savannah. Paul, a World War II veteran who is also a great singer and routinely leads us in patriotic songs at veterans events, has recently been given the French governments highest possible honor, the Legion of Honor, for his military service and role in helping to free France from Nazi occupation. A link to my tribute can be found here. Once back in my office, we have our weekly all district conference call to discuss last weeks events in the district, upcoming events and casework. Later, I have a series of phone interviews to discuss President Trumps fiscal year 2021 budget proposal that was released today and includes full funding for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) for the fourth straight year. Funding this project was one of my top priorities when I took office five years ago and this good news should allow us to complete dredging by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. My first interview is with WTOC TV in Savannah, followed by the Savannah Morning News (SMN) and WJCL TV in Savannah. A link to these stories can be found here, here and here.

Once back in my office, I have a phone interview with WSAV TV in Savannah to discuss SHEP funding. A link to this interview can be found here. The good news on the Port of Savannah keeps coming as we find out today that we have secured a $34.6 million Department of Transportation (DOT) grant that will allow us to straighten and realign one of the oldest parts of the Port to accommodate larger ships. Before heading to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day, I have a phone interview with the SMN to discuss the grant. A link to the story can be found here. After votes, I remain in the House Chamber where I memorialize Ann Cox Chambers who recently passed. A link to my tribute can be found here. Rep. Carter meeting with a delegation from the Federal Bureau of Prisons Once back in my office, I have a meeting with the Georgia Special Olympics delegation followed by a meeting with the Director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Scientists (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Wednesday, February 12, 2020: Im up early this morning and head to downtown Washington with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as we meet with CEOs of pharmaceutical manufacturers to discuss the prescription drug pricing bills being considered in Congress. Once back at the Capitol, I head to a GOP policy conference where we discuss the threats posed by China and hear from experts in the field.

Rob Woodall (R-GA), a member of the Budget and Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committees. Before calling it a day, I head to the T&I Committee room where I film this weeks edition of Buddys Briefings. Thursday, February 13, 2020: Having owned my own business for over 30 years, Ive had many associates come and go. While youre always glad to see someone better themselves, many are difficult to replace. After an early morning meeting with leadership to discuss election issues, I spend the next few hours in my office interviewing candidates for our health care legislative assistant position. Fortunately, because I serve on the E&C Healthcare Subcommittee, top candidates are attracted to our office and we have quality interviews. After filming a quick video to promote our open house next Wednesday, February 19th, at our new Brunswick district office location, I head to the House Chamber for our only vote series of the day before heading to the airport for my return trip home. Friday, February 14, 2020: After getting a few hours of sleep last night, Im up early for my Band of Brothers bible study in Garden City this morning and afterwards head down to St. Simons Island where I have the pleasure of visiting St. Simons Christian School.  Rep. Carter visiting St. Simons Christian School Ive always said that interacting with students is my favorite part of serving in this position and today is another example why. What a great group of students! Because it is a small school, I get to visit each classroom from pre-K through 5th and then meet with the 6th through 8th grade classes as a group. They ask great questions and I thoroughly enjoy my visit. Afterwards, I head to Sea Island where my good friend, Jonathan RacIin, has assembled an outstanding group of community leaders for a round table discussion on national and world issues.

My last stop of yet another busy week is to Tybee Island where the Two Hundred Club of the Coastal Empire is hosting a benefit. This great organization helps provide for the surviving spouses and dependents of law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics who lose their lives in the line of duty.

Bost                  The Bost Bulletin Friend,  As we celebrate Presidents' Day tomorrow, it's important to note the impact each president has had on our nation's history, including Illinois' own Abraham Lincoln. His dedication to freedom is a shining example of the values our country represents. Here's what I've been up to this week.   Protecting Our Children in Schools Having the Securing Our Schools Act, a bill I introduced, signed into law by the President is one of my proudest achievements while serving in Congress. This law created the School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) to provide law enforcement with the appropriate tools and technology they need to make classrooms safer. Starting this week, the SVPP is accepting applications through April 8, 2020 for this year&#8217;s round of grant funding. For more information, please visit here. As a former first responder, I encourage local government leaders, school administrators, and law enforcement to apply ASAP!  Safeguarding Veteran Votes Ensuring Americans have a say in who leads our government is a right our veterans overseas fight for every day. Too often, however, our men and women serving across the world are unable to have their absentee ballots arrive to the States on time for the collection deadline.This is completely unacceptable, which is why I am proud to tell you that I have cosponsored the Counting All Military Votes Act to improve voting accessibility for American active duty service members. Our military men and women overseas are committed to keeping American diplomats and citizens safe and deserve peace of mind knowing that their ballot will be counted in a timely manner.     Empowering the Postal Service Since its creation in 1775, the USPS has remained one of the most reliable government agencies. In fact, it is one of the few explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution. Today, the USPS employs over 600,000 workers and continues to be an integral function of our government and economy. However, due to a mandate passed over a decade ago, the USPS is obligated to pre-fund its future pensions, losing the agency millions of dollars every year. I'm proud to tell you that legislation I cosponsored, the USPS Fairness Act, passed the House last week. This bill will make sure that employees within the USPS will receive the same retiree health funding benefits that apply to all other federal agencies and allow the USPS to invest in itself for the first time in years.  Prior to its passage, I spoke on the House Floor in support of this legislation. To hear my remarks, please click the link below.     Sending Valentines for Veterans On Thursday, I joined my colleagues in writing Valentine's Day messages to be sent to veterans living in the Washington, D.C. area. Veterans selflessly signed up to defend the freedoms of our great country without asking for anything in return. As a Marine and father of a Marine, I was honored to take part in this small gesture of appreciation for those who have served our nation.    Protecting Correctional Officers Our district is home to United States Penitentiary Marion, but like many facilities, it is not staffed at the proper level. Studies show that understaffed facilities have more assaults against workers and more inmate suicides. Recently, I led a letter asking the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide the Bureau of Prisons with direct-hiring authority, which would allow individual facilities to hire the staff they need on their own timelines.&nbsp;This week, I was honored to accept the Legislative Appreciation Award from the Council of Prison Locals for my work on this issue and will continue to make sure the safety of correctional facility staff and inmates is a top priority.&nbsp;     Investing in Illinois Waterways I met with Illinois members of the Waterways Council to discuss the funding and maintenance of our system of inland waterways and ports. With millions of tons of cargo transported on the Mississippi River every year, this issue is one of my top priorities. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will continue to make sure Southern Illinois's waterways are taken care of.     Meeting with Southern Illinois Community Colleges Earlier in the week, I had the chance to meet with Interim President Dr. Kathleen Curphy and Don Patton with Shawnee Community College as well as several administrators and trustees from John A. Logan Community College to discuss access to grants, lowering costs of tuition, and bolstering job training for career and technical education (CTE) programs. As a member of the Congressional CTE Caucus, I will continue to support these critically important programs.   It was a productive week here in Washington, with a schedule jam-packed full of meeting with folks from across our district. I&#8217;m looking forward being back in Southern Illinois for our district work week.  I hope you enjoy Presidents' Day tomorrow and are able to relax and reflect on the blessings in your life. Enjoy your week!  -Mike                  Unsubscribe    ","district":"12","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Republican","score":2.0280917},{"name":"Congressman Lloyd Smucker","address":"PA11LS.Outreach@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-16","subject":"Responding to your message","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }         News from Representative Smucker  &nbsp; &nbsp;           Home About Contact Media Services       Hello Lindsey--  Thank you for subscribing to my E-newsletter!

Our nation has truly experienced a blue-collar boom, with strong year-over-year wage growth and record low unemployment.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice President Pence Visits Lancaster!

I had the honor of being joined by Pastor Matt Mylin and his wife Kelly, who lead the congregation at the Worship Center in Leola, PA. The morning featured an uplifting message from keynote speaker Arthur Brooks.       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Floor &nbsp;  This past week, I had the opportunity to speak from the floor of the House to honor two community leaders and to oppose legislation which would harm American workers.  I spoke out against the PRO Act, which is a massive giveaway to union special interests and would have drastically changed the balance of labor laws in favor of unions and against American workers.

Additionally, I spoke on the House floor to honor the life of Mr. Robert Aichele, a community leader in Lancaster County, who passed away at the age of 92 last week.

As I said on the House floor, I am an equal to every one of my male colleagues in Congress until I walk out the door and down the steps of the Capitol. Then I am relegated to second-class status because women are not recognized in the Constitution as fully equal to men under the law. Thursday&#8217;s vote on H.J.Res.79, my resolution to facilitate ratification of the ERA, was a vote for equality, the American dream, and that more perfect union. I am proud of House Democrats, and five of our Republican colleagues,&nbsp;who&nbsp;joined me in championing&nbsp;the fight for women&#8217;s rights and greater equality. House Democrats also continued our work to protect our environment and natural spaces with a sweeping wilderness protection bill, and we voted to establish the first museum in the United States dedicated to the celebration and recognition of women&#8217;s history. We also turned the spotlight on threats to our nation with the&nbsp;Military Personnel Committee hearing that I chaired and that focused on the rise of white supremacy in our military, the House Armed Services Committee hearing on the malign actions of foreign adversaries including Russia and China, and my work to expose and eradicate the corrosive effects of sexual assault on our brave servicemembers &#8211; which threatens unit cohesion and military readiness. I was proud to introduce a resolution with Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA)&nbsp;to establish an international anti-corruption court&nbsp;to address the impact that corruption has on&nbsp;human rights worldwide and the challenge of holding kleptocrats accountable for their crimes, and much more as you will read below. I am looking forward&nbsp;to being home in the 14th District this coming week. Then it&#8217;s back to Washington, DC the week of February 24th, and a return of Jackie&#8217;s DC Dashboard, so be sure to keep an eye out for the next update.                   As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

By 1982, 35 states out of the required 38 states voted to ratify the amendment. In the past three years, grassroots campaigns have successfully secured the final ratification votes in Nevada, Illinois, and most recently, Virginia. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel recently put out a legal opinion that the current ERA push is dead and that Congress lacks the authority to revive it. The Archivist, who is responsible for certifying amendments to the Constitution once ratified by three-fourths of the states, has decided to follow DOJ&#8217;s guidance even though Article V makes clear the Executive has no role in the Constitutional amendment process. Our vote to eliminate the arbitrary deadline brings us closer to placing this important guarantee of women&#8217;s equality in our founding document. It is now up to the Senate to follow suit and vote on companion legislation by Senators Murkowski and Cardin, and the Archivist to move forward with certifying the ERA.  Voted for Sweeping Wilderness Bill This week, the House took a major step toward protecting our public lands by voting to designate almost 1.4 million acres of land as wilderness and adding 1,000 river miles to the National Wild and Scenic River Systems. H.R. 2546, the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act, would preserve natural spaces in California, Colorado, and Washington for generations to come by protecting them from logging, mining, drilling, and new construction. It would also improve recreational access for underserved communities, safeguard ancestral homelands and tribal access, and boost local economies. Despite the bipartisan House vote, the Senate Majority Mitch McConnell is likely to relegate this critically-needed bill to his legislative graveyard. President Trump has also threatened to veto this legislation if it reaches his desk. But this fight is far from over. Our public lands are our most important natural heritage and an important tool in the fight against climate change. House Democrats will continue to push for wilderness and environmental protections as Americans across the continue to demand action this election year. Voted to Create a Smithsonian Women&#8217;s History Museum On Tuesday, House Democrats passed H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women&#8217;s History Museum Act. This bipartisan legislation would establish a Smithsonian museum dedicated to women&#8217;s history on the National Mall. Currently, we do not have a comprehensive museum in America documenting women&#8217;s history. Without it, women&#8217;s contributions to the nation are too often forgotten and could be lost as distant and forgotten memories. The stories of women in this country are too integral to our history to push aside. I was proud to vote for this historic legislation and urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass it so that we can get to work building this museum!    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Chaired MILPERS Hearing on White Supremacists in the Military  There are several warning signs that these efforts have found success. Recent high-profile examples include a Marine attending the 2017 Charlottesville rally, a Coast Guard officer arrested with a cache of weapons, and a West Point graduate espousing hate on social media. It seems that the military is not only not taking this threat seriously enough, it also lacks the tools it needs and has failed to dedicate sufficient resources to fighting this threat. At the hearing, we discussed necessary improvements to the accessions process, how we investigate and punish white supremacist activity in the forces, and how we report and track these individuals after they have been expelled from the military. I look forward to an update from military leadership soon on the progress that they will make in focusing on this issue with the seriousness and commitment that it demands. You can watch the hearing here.  House Armed Services Committee Hearing on Threats Posed by Russia and China This week, I attended the House Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department&#8217;s role in our national efforts to address the threats and challenges posed by Russia and China&#8212;two formidable countries that do not share our values. The DoD is focused on ensuring that the United States is ready to compete with those countries militarily, but at the hearing we discussed the importance of addressing less traditional acts of aggression, such as propaganda operations, cyber-attacks, and predatory economic practices. Countering these threats will require a comprehensive strategy across our government, executed in partnership with our allies.  Spoke on a Panel about Military Sexual Assault&nbsp; On Wednesday night, I attended Heroine, a one-woman show about a female soldier performed at the beautiful Kennedy Center. The play, which is based on a real story, describes a woman&#8217;s struggle with addiction, depression, and suicide after being raped by soldiers in her unit. I was deeply impressed by how the performance conveyed the horror of military sexual assault and lasting pains with which survivors must wrestle. After the play, I sat on a panel with military justice experts to discuss our ongoing efforts to address this issue. As the Chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, I have made eradicating military sexual violence a top priority because our military cannot succeed while battling this scourge within its ranks.&nbsp;    Meetings with Jackie Meeting with Local Veterans Affairs Department Union On Wednesday, I met with leaders of AFGE Local 2110, the union that represents workers at our local VA hospital and clinic. We discussed our ongoing efforts to improve VA locality pay to offset the high cost of living in our area and help the VA recruit and retain staff. The VA representatives also shared the way that the Trump Administration&#8217;s anti-union actions have constrained their ability to operate. I remain committed to helping AFGE as it fights for its members to receive a living wage and fair representation.  Met with Northern California Special Olympics Delegation  Met with the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District On Wednesday I met with representatives of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District (GGBHTD) to discuss opportunities for supporting San Francisco&#8217;s infrastructure needs. The District shared their plans for upcoming federal grant opportunities, and I look forward to lending my support to their work. We discussed the District&#8217;s concerns around the lack of federal funding to California for critical infrastructure needs, such as seismic retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge and expansion of the ferry boat system. I share many of their concerns, especially given President Trump&#8217;s vindictive attitude toward California.  The GGBHTD also provided updates on important projects and policies such as drone restrictions over the bridge, construction of the suicide net, and new safety measures for the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is an icon of the Bay Area as well as a vital piece of infrastructure for the region. I remain committed to supporting GGBHT and the needs of all Bay Area residents.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District  Here are some issues raised this week:   99 constituents expressed support for H.R. 230, the Ban Toxic Pesticides Act of 2019. I am a cosponsor of this crucial piece of legislation that would ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and prohibit any future registration of the pesticide. Please know that I will always fight to protect public health and safety, and ensure that our water, produce, and environment is safe from toxic chemicals. 87 constituents expressed concern with fracking.&nbsp; Like you, I am deeply concerned about the effect of fracking on water sources. I take regulation of hydraulic fracturing seriously and will fight to protect the health and safety of all Americans. I am also deeply committed to supporting clean technology innovation, including solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, advanced biofuels, and other renewable energy sources 27 constituents expressed support for our public lands. Our landscapes and national parks are treasures that must be preserved for future generations. I am proud to have been named a \"Friend of the National Parks,\" and I am committed to conserving our natural heritage.

During the first half of February, I attended President Donald Trump's inspiring State of the Union address, traveled with President Trump for the Opportunity Now Summit, and met with school leaders on education issues. I also had the opportunity to personally award the winner of the Congressional App Challenge. Below you can also find information on this year's Congressional Art Competition.  State of the Union Address In President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, he reaffirmed his commitment to keeping his promises.&nbsp; South Carolina has seen his kept promises first-hand. At 2.3 percent, South Carolina&#8217;s unemployment rate is at a record low. Since President Trump&#8217;s election, 122,000 jobs have been created in South Carolina&#8212;including 19,000 manufacturing jobs, wages increased 4 percent by an average of $5,000 for families in South Carolina. Read my full statement on the President's State of the Union address here.&nbsp;  Opportunity NOW Summit&nbsp; I was grateful to travel with President Trump for the launch of Opportunity NOW, a new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across America.

February 14, 2020 Congressman Lipinski Hosts Climate Change Panel at Lewis University Featuring Tom Skilling and Other Climate Experts Rep. Lipinski meets with meteorologist Tom Skilling before the climate panel at Lewis University on February 1st.? ? Watch the panel discussion here  Congressman Lipinski hosted a panel of climate change experts speaking before a sold-out audience at Lewis University on February 1st. The panel, moderated by Rep. Lipinski, featured award-winning WGN-TV Chief Meteorologist Tom Skilling and four other experts speaking about the short and long-term consequences of climate change and potential solutions. Congressman Lipinski has been leading on climate issues since he was first elected to Congress in 2005. The first two bills he introduced that went on to become laws championed innovative solutions to climate change. In 2009, he also helped to introduce the first bipartisan bill to institute a fee on carbon emissions to fight climate change. More recently, the Congressman introduced the bipartisan Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act, which establishes a fee on greenhouse gas emissions and returns all the revenue generated by cutting payroll taxes, increasing Social Security benefits, and increasing funding for weatherization programs and low-income home energy assistance. The Lewis University panel provided the Congressman with added insight and an opportunity for community feedback. Other panelists at the forum included Doug Sisterson, retired Argonne National Laboratory research meteorologist; Dr. Don Wuebbles, the Harry E. Preble Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Dr. Laura Franklin, Dean of Lewis University?s College of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Communications; and Dr. Seth Darling, Director of the Center for Molecular Engineering and Senior Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. All five panelists spoke directly about the science behind climate change and the need to act. ?I learned so much from the expert panelists on this forum,? Congressman Lipinski said. ?I left with a great sense of optimism after seeing the number of young people who were taking an active interest in climate change.? Congressman Lipinski Helps House Pass Legislation Supporting Unions? Right to Organize Rep. Lipinski speaks about his support for the PRO Act on the floor of the House of Representatives on February 6th. Watch the Congressman?s floor speech here  Congressman Lipinski last week stood up for the rights of union workers by voting forH.R. 2474 , the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. The PRO Act guarantees protections against harassment and retribution for workers who attempt to form or join a union. The legislation would ensure that union members in the Third District of Illinois are permitted to stand together in pursuit of higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions. The bipartisan effort is designed to offer a comprehensive solution to the problems faced by workers in exercising their right to organize, including ensuring access to fair union elections and preserving collective bargaining agreements. Congressman Lipinski spoke on the House floor in support of the legislation. ?I am a proud supporter of the hardworking men and women of our nation. And no one does more for American workers than organized labor,? said Congressman Lipinski. ?Workers standing together and bargaining collectively have been instrumental in building our Country and our middle class for more than a century. Unions helped bring tens of millions of good paying jobs to Americans by working for fair and safe workplaces and better wages and benefits. In Chicagoland, we are fortunate to have many labor unions fighting every day to improve the lives of workers and their families. Across my district, thousands display a lawn sign created by the Chicago Federation of Labor that reads Proud Union Home, but sadly, some are now trying to hinder collective bargaining and undermine the National Labor Relations Act just at a time where workers need greater protection. I voted to pass the PRO Act because I support American workers and I support American prosperity.? Chairman Lipinski Invites Chicago Alderman Matt O?Shea to Testify at Rail Subcommittee Hearing on Blocked Crossings, Noise, and Safety Concerns Chairman Lipinski stands with Alderman O?Shea following the Feb. 5th hearing of the House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.? Watch the full hearing online here  Chairman Lipinski was pleased to welcome 19th Ward Chicago Alderman Matt O?Shea to Capitol Hill last week to testify about blocked rail grade crossings during a hearing of the Congressman?s Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. Blocked rail crossings at roadways pose several noise and safety concerns for communities in the Third Congressional District, including impeding the flow of traffic and preventing emergency responders from reaching individuals in life-or-death situations. Both Chairman Lipinski and Alderman O?Shea have played an active role in addressing the problem of blocked crossings for several years. Chairman Lipinski has made the issue a priority for his office and for the Subcommittee in the current session of Congress. ?I am committed to exploring innovative solutions that will improve safety and end the gridlock caused by idling or broken-down trains in the Chicago area and around the country,? said Chairman Lipinski. ?This hearing will provide much-needed answers to help us craft laws that will protect our constituents and put an end to practices that hinder their ability to get to work, reach loved ones, and perform the other essential tasks of daily life. Alderman O?Shea?s testimony will give voice to the concerns of area residents, and I am pleased to welcome him to Capitol Hill for the hearing.? Rep. Lipinski Attends Ribbon Cutting for New Warming Shelters at Metra's Summit Station ? Congressman Lipinski joins Metra representatives and community leaders at a ribbon cutting ceremony for a new warming shelter at Metra?s Summit Station. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, Congressman Lipinski works to secure federal funds for the Heritage Corridor line and other rail services around the region. Rep. Lipinski Votes for the Great Lakes Restoration Act Congressman Lipinski tours the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that runs through the Third Congressional District. ? Click here to read Rep. Lipinski's statement in support of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  The Great Lakes provide drinking water to more than 30 million people, support more than 30,000 jobs, and are home to more than 3,500 plant and animal species. The Great Lakes are essential to life in our region and our nation, but they also face significant threats from algal blooms, pollution, and invasive species. Last week, Congressman Lipinski joined a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers to support The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (H.R. 4031 ), which helps to protect vital resources and ensure the continued health of the Great Lakes. The Congressman served as a co-sponsor of the legislation and worked to inform other members about the benefits of the Initiative. ?Constituents of the Third District regularly reach out to me to emphasize the importance of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Those constituents recognize how important the Great Lakes are to our region, and I could not agree more,? said Congressman Lipinski. ?The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative provides vital protections for our drinking water, environment, and local economy. I am proud to stand with members on both sides of the aisle in leading the fight for this initiative.?      Unsubscribe  ? ? ?

This legislation addresses growing student loan debt by making the student loan interest tax deduction work better for married couples. Current law penalizes married couples by only allowing them to take one deduction&#8212;even if both spouses qualify. This bill would stop this unfair tax on student loans against married couples while also helping individuals with their student loan debt burden. For decades, hardworking Americans have been saddled with student loan debt which has delayed their dreams of achieving financial stability. I am proud to lead this effort to maximize the student loan interest tax deduction that married couples can claim each tax year. This allows married couples to put more towards paying off their student loans, incur less interest, put more food on the table, or save a little more for a down payment on a home. This unfair marriage penalty came to my attention after Claudia McHale, a constituent from Garden City, discussed with me the situation of her niece and her husband. Both of them paid towards reducing their student loan yet were only able to claim a $2,500 deduction between the two of them, the same maximum amount a single individual can claim every tax year. As Claudia said, &#8220;it is ridiculous that the federal government punishes taxpayers with student loan balances just because they get married.&#8221;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; __________  On Tuesday, I received the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council. This recognition is awarded to Members of Congress with a proven record of defending the right to life, religious freedoms, and family values.   It is truly an honor to represent Missouri's 4th congressional district as we fight for our foundational values.  Legislative Update On Thursday, Democrat leadership in the House attempted resurrect the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) through Congress.  I commend the women who have gone before us, to celebrate the achievements women have made, and to reaffirm the fact that we are already equal in the eyes of God and in law. Women make up 51% of the population, comprise over half of college students, make up most of today&#8217;s medical and law school students, and own the majority of new businesses. Little girls can be whatever they want to be whether that be an astronaut, a doctor, a full-time mom working at home, or a Member of Congress.  In addition, federal law and court precedent uphold our rights. That is something to applaud and I do.  However, today&#8217;s legislation is problematic on several fronts. First, the resolution is unconstitutional. The time limit to pass the ERA expired decades ago. Congress can&#8217;t go back and remove a deadline from a previous constitutional amendment initiative. The Supreme Court has recognized that the 1972 ERA expired, and the Department of Justice issued a ruling saying, &#8220;Congress may not revive a proposed amendment after a deadline for its ratification has expired.&#8221; Pretending we can remove the time limits for passage is both futile and deceptive. Secondly, if the time limit COULD be extended, the ERA would not bring women any more rights than they currently have but it would entrench the legality of abortion. We know this from court precedent and by listening to those who have the most to gain from constitutionally protecting abortion on demand.  In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Rights Amendment in their state constitution requires state-funding of abortions. Federal courts are likely to do the same. Perhaps this is why every major pro-abortion organization is endorsing passage of the ERA.  NARAL Pro-Choice America says: &#8220;With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion&#8230;.&#8221; National Organization for Women: &#8220;An ERA&#8212;properly interpreted&#8212;could negate the hundreds of laws that have been passed restricting access to abortion care.&#8230;&#8221; But that&#8217;s not the only concern with passing this resolution. Besides being unconstitutional and shredding state and federal pro-life protections, the ERA would also erase decades of progress which have provided opportunities for women, advanced women&#8217;s progress through federal programs, and secured necessary protections for women and girls. How? By incorporating gender identity in the definition of &#8216;sex&#8217;, jeopardizing private spaces for women, girls&#8217; sports programs, and women&#8217;s educational institutions.  By banning distinctions between men and women, the ERA also endangers laws, programs and funding designed to benefit women. The ERA provides a pathway for legal challenges to welfare programs, grants for battered women&#8217;s shelters, efforts to bolster women participating in STEM programs. These outcomes of the ERA are anything but pro-woman. I urge my colleagues to vote &#8216;No&#8217; on today&#8217;s resolution and uphold the Constitution, promote life, and protect women&#8217;s rights that have been so hard-fought gained.  District Update I am so pleased to tell you about an honor recently won by Columbia Public Schools. Project Tomorrow is a national education nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that&nbsp;today&#8217;s students are well prepared to be tomorrow&#8217;s innovators, leaders, and engaged citizens of the world. Project Tomorrow is recognizing Columbia Public Schools with its annual Speak Up District of Honor award, an honor given to school districts for leadership and commitment to listening to the voices and views of students, parents, and educators.    I believe it is through these valuable exchanges that better learning experiences are created for students from kindergarten through the 12th grade. Congratulations to Columbia Public Schools for earning this distinction and for its dedication to improving and enhancing the educational experience for its students.  Constituent Update I want to share with you that our office has joined forces with the Library of Congress to help preserve, forever, the stories of our veterans.   The Veterans History Project began as an effort to collect the accounts of America&#8217;s World War II heroes, many of whom are passing away without their stories being saved for posterity. It has since expanded to veterans of all military encounters with the goal of ensuring their personal memories are recorded and made available for future generations. If you are a veteran or if you know a veteran who would like to share your experiences as part of the Veterans History Project, contact Steve Walsh in our Columbia office at 573-442-9311.

Every time I step on the House floor, I&#8217;m focused on legislation that will help our district - whether that&#8217;s lowering out of pocket health care costs or making sure every student gets a quality education. No matter what is happening in Washington, I won&#8217;t lose sight of the issues we face back home.&nbsp; I was especially lucky to introduce Kathy Zeman to the House Agriculture Committee earlier this week. Kathy farms in Rice County and she came to Washington to testify in support of the Local Agricultural Markets Program which promotes farmers&#8217; markets around the country.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Expanding Higher Ed Opportunities  On Tuesday, I spoke with Minnesota State about how we can expand higher ed opportunities for our students. If education isn&#8217;t affordable, it&#8217;s not accessible.   &nbsp;     Improving Rural Health CareRight now, there are insufficient health care resources in our rural communities. Wednesday, I met with folks from the Minnesota Department of Health to talk about the unique healthcare challenges facing rural patients and providers.       Advocating for Minnesota River Funding&nbsp;This week, I sat down with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and the Waterways Council to discuss the importance of the Minnesota River Dredging project in keeping the river fully operational. The river transports about 4 million tons annually, worth more than $362 Million in economic value.   &nbsp;     Pushing for Ratification of the ERA:&nbsp;Equal rights for women should not have a deadline. In fact, it&#8217;s long past time. That&#8217;s why I voted to remove the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment on Thursday.  Protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social SecurityThe President&#8217;s budget proposes cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I&#8217;ll never stand for that. Watch my video about these cuts here.&nbsp;  Supporting the Special OlympicsThis week was Special Olympics Hill Day! It was great meeting with our Minnesota delegation about empowering folks with different abilities.       Meeting Rescue PuppiesThursday, I stopped by the ASPCA Paws for Love pet adoption event to give out some belly rubs.   &nbsp;     Funding Recreational TrailsThis week, I introduced the Recreational Trails Full Funding Act of 2020 with Rep. Welch to make sure folks have quality trails to enjoy Minnesota&#8217;s four seasons for hiking, cross country skiing and taking their ATV&#8217;s out. Not only will this bill invest in these opportunities right now, but it also makes sure future generations of Minnesotans and visitors can experience the beauty of the Minnesota River Valley and our well-traveled trails from Zumbrota to Cottage Grove.&nbsp;  Upcoming Event:Excited to announce my February town hall!

It was a very eventful week and I'm excited to tell you about what we accomplished. Here are some highlights:   I was the Grand Marshall for the Ninth Annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade I toured the Indian River Lagoon to see living shorelines and learn more about preserving our environment I attended the signing of the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act by President Trump at the White House I spoke on the House floor in recognition of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and her contributions to our community and country  CELEBRATING OUR RACING HISTORY: This weekend I had the honor of serving as the Grand Marshall of this year&#8217;s Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade! Since the 1920s, Daytona Beach has been the home of&nbsp;NASCAR, with drivers setting records racing down our beach to the famous North Turn and A1A. This race is an important part of our community&#8217;s history and it&#8217;s always one of my favorite events every year!    Serving as Grand Marshall at the 9th annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade  CONSERVING OUR SHORELINE:&nbsp;Our beautiful and natural shorelines can co-exist with development when done correctly. Living shorelines and mangroves are important for our communities because they are the best natural barriers against storm surges. Estuaries and mangroves are also important to commercial fisherman. Around 80 percent of them rely on estuaries and mangroves for spawning.&nbsp;I enjoyed touring our local living shorelines to learn more about how conservancies bring free market, volunteering and community based solutions to our community. It's important we maintain our living shorelines to help keep Florida resilient.&nbsp;    Views of our Indian River Lagoon living shoreline  SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS: This week, I went to the White House to see President Trump sign another bill supporting our veterans into law &#8212; and this time, it was a bill I co-sponsored! The&nbsp;Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act&nbsp;supports our veterans, helping them find opportunities for jobs in STEM fields when they return to civilian life. I was glad&nbsp;to work on this bill with two fellow Florida congressmen, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Neal Dunn, and I was proud to be there as the President signed it into law!    President Trump signing the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act into law RECOGNIZING SERVANT LEADERSHIP: I can't think of anyone better to highlight great servant leadership in our community and our country this Black History Month than our district's very own Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. Bethune founded and was President of the all African-American girls school in Daytona Beach, which later became&nbsp;Bethune&#8211;Cookman University. Bethune selflessly dedicated herself to fighting for the equality and civil rights of all Americans through education and because of her, Florida and America are a better place.

It is important to remember that Congress holds the power of the purse. The President's budget is merely a reflection of his priorities and a suggestion to the House and Senate. His proposal demonstrates his commitment to decreasing our national debt and balancing our federal budget, and we can use his proposal to guide our discussions in Congress. I am proud to serve on the powerful Appropriations Committee, which sets the funding levels for discretionary spending, and we have a lot of work to do. We have already started hosting Appropriations Subcommittee hearings to discuss funding for different departments and offices of the federal government. One place where I believe the President's budget proposal fell short was at Hanford. Since I came to Congress, every Administration has proposed cuts to the Hanford cleanup, and I have worked across the aisle to restore funding. Federal dollars are critical to ensuring the men and women of the Hanford workforce are able to safely and efficiently clean up the millions of gallons of nuclear waste at the Hanford Site, keep our groundwater and the Columbia River safe from contamination, and fulfill the federal government's promise to the Tri-Cities community.&nbsp;    The Columbian: \"In Our View: Nuclear waste requires innovative solutions\"  President Trump's proposal also did not include funding for the licensing of Yucca Mountain, which is a change from his previous position. It is the law of the land: Yucca Mountain is the nation's sole permanent repository for nuclear waste. With 56 gallons of nuclear waste at the Hanford Site alone, no district in the United States is more dependent on Yucca Mountain than Washington's 4th. I have met personally with the President to urge him to reconsider his change in position.&nbsp; As we continue through the Appropriations process, I will work to represent Central Washington's priorities and ensure the federal government fulfills its moral and legal obligation to clean up the Hanford Site.&nbsp;  Healthy Forests Prevent Wildfires   In Central Washington, we understand how important active land management is for wildfire prevention. I am proud to support commonsense land management practices and policies that both protect our national forests and communities from wildfires but also protect the environment. My friend, Rep. Westerman, recently introduced the Trillion Trees Act that would plant 1 trillion trees by 2050 and incentivize the use of wood products as carbon sequestration devices. This week, I visited with U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen and attended a Summit on Active Forest Management and Wildfire Suppression, hosted by the Western Caucus, to discuss Rep. Westerman's proposal and several ways we can promote healthy forests and sustain our public lands. Native Communities Have Had Enough   Patricia Whitefoot has been an incredible advocate for Native women and a critical ally for me as we work in Congress to address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. She joined me in the nation's Capitol to discuss our legislative efforts like Savanna's Act that - for too long - have been stalled in the Judiciary Committee. I have met with tribal leaders across the Pacific Northwest to hear how this crisis is affecting our communities. One thing is clear: Native communities have had enough. We cannot continue to drag our feet while the loved ones of these women wait for answers.&nbsp; Calling All High School Artists: Congressional Art Competition   The 2020 Central Washington Congressional Art Competition is now OPEN! This competition is an opportunity for students in Central Washington to tell a story and express themselves through art. Year after year, I am impressed by the talent and creativity of these young people. I look forward to seeing the new submissions!&nbsp; The Art Competition is open to all high school students in Washington's 4th Congressional District. The winner's artwork will hang in the U.S. Capitol for one year, and the winning artist will receive two plane tickets to Washington D.C. Find more details, rules, and regulations on my website.&nbsp;  To stay current on the work I am doing around the District and in Washington D.C., I encourage you to follow me&nbsp; on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and to read updates&nbsp;on my&nbsp;website.&nbsp; It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.

I met with leaders on education and labor policy to inform my legislative work and attended hearings with my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Legislation Meetings&nbsp; Foreign Affairs  Legislation  Last Tuesday, the House considered a bill that I cosponsored, H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness Act, introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR). In 2006, the United States Postal Service was required to be the only government agency to pre-fund health care for all employees present and future. In the changing landscape of distribution in the following 14 years, I believe, along with many of my colleagues, that this is an unsustainable burden on of our nation&#8217;s most important public services. I voted in favor of H.R. 2382, which would repeal the 2006 mandate and passed on a bipartisan vote of 309-106.  Last Thursday, I voted in favor of H. Res.826, a bill expressing disapproval of the Administration&#8217;s Medicaid block grant proposal, introduced by Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX). It is critical to protect Medicaid recipients against any efforts to undermine or reduce coverage, especially in the face of rising health care and prescription drug costs. H.Res.826 passed by a vote 223-190. Later that day, I also voted for another bill that I cosponsored, H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019, introduced by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA). As inequality in our economy spikes, the rights of workers to organize and protect themselves must be guarded at all costs. H.R. 2474 protects the right to strike, the right to act in solidarity with workers at other companies, the right to pursue justice through class action, and other fundamental rights.&nbsp; This bill also strengthens the ability of workers to negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, and secure first contract agreements. H.R. 2474 passed by a vote of 224-194.  Crucially, the House also passed H.R. 5687, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief and Puerto Rico Disaster Tax Relief Act, introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY). This package provides $4.67 billion in emergency supplemental aid for Puerto Rico following a series of intense earthquakes in recent months. I voted in favor of this package and will continue working with my colleagues to help Puerto Rico rebuild.&nbsp; H.R. 5687 passed by a vote of 237-161. All of the bills passed this week have been sent to the Senate for consideration. Meetings  Last Wednesday, I met with representatives of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. We discussed my support for labor unions and the work Congress is currently undertaking to progress labor rights across the country. The following day, I met with the National Education Association. Speaking with NEA Director Donna Mirabelli and New Jersey Director Anita Kober, we went over legislative priorities for protecting our public schools and expanding funding to ensure the success of students. Afterwards, I spoke at &#8220;Dominicans on the Hill&#8221; day, an event hosted by my friend Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY). I am thrilled every year to meet with the constituents who travel to Washington and am proud to be a longtime supporter of the Dominican community.  Foreign Affairs&nbsp;  I attended a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Wednesday focused on the challenges facing women in global health. As Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I was proud to bring the knowledge my Subcommittee colleagues and I have fostered on women&#8217;s health issues to the full Committee hearing. When I visited the Venezuela-Colombia border, I spoke directly with Venezuelan women about their concerns for the health and safety of them and their children. Sheba Crocker, Vice President for Humanitarian Policy and Practice at the relief agency CARE, emphasized how the stories I heard firsthand represent the prevalence of gender-based violence, stemming in part from the Venezuela crisis. Congress must always look to lift up marginalized voices in the creation of our foreign policy and work to overcome challenges women face in global health.&nbsp;  As Latvia will celebrate the 30th anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union later this year, I met with Rihards Kols, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the Latvian Saeima, and Reinis Znotins, Chairman of the IT and Innovative Entrepreneurship Subcommittee. I emphasized my commitment to combating Russian aggression and we discussed how a Belarus travel ban could make the country more susceptible to Russian influence. On Thursday, I sat down with Metin Hakverdi, a member of the German Bundestag, to express our mutual support for a strong U.S.- German relationship. Also last Thursday, I met with Juan Guaid&#243;, Venezuela&#8217;s Interim President, along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House colleagues. Nearly 5 million Venezuelans have been forced to flee their homes due to a humanitarian crisis caused by Nicol&#225;s Maduro. I spoke with President Guaid&#243; about how to bolster our international aid response and promote democratic elections in Venezuela. Additionally, I voiced my support for granting Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to protect Venezuelans already here in the U.S. Last Friday, I met with Taiwan&#8217;s Vice President Elect, Lai Ching-te, along with some of my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. We discussed Taiwan&#8217;s recent election, Taiwan&#8217;s response to the coronavirus, and the U.S-Taiwan partnership.  Thank you for reading the Washington Review.

Congress has been stuck at a standstill for too long. Having been sworn into Congress only a week prior to the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, I am thankful this storm has passed and I can finally begin the legislative work eastern North Carolinians elected me to do. Congress could and should have been working on issues like healthcare, prescription drugs, border security and more instead of this tiresome and illegitimate impeachment. Hopefully, we can finally get back to tending to the business of the people. Unfortunately, I doubt that will be the case after the petty and partisan theatrics displayed by Speaker Pelosi at the State of the Union address. Bipartisan efforts that would benefit the American people will likely be forgone due to the Speakers disdain for the president and her fear of giving him legislative victories. America deserves better. What's going on with coronavirus? As a physician and member of Congress, I wanted to give you all an update on the status of the coronavirus and how the United States is working to combat its spread. Watch the video below to learn more. Surprise billing There is bipartisan agreement that surprise billing is a major problem for patients and families across America. It desperately needs to be addressed. While Im glad we discussed the best path forward to alleviate the problems of surprise billing during a markup of H.R. 5800 in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week, this legislation is not the right solution to this problem. Even though I couldn't support H.R. 5800 in its entirety, I was glad to improve it with two amendments that were adopted unanimously. As a physician, I'll continue to utilize my expertise on these issues to lower the cost of healthcare and increase patient access to provide Americans with the greatest treatments possible. Watch my opening statement below: Veterans HOPE Act Last week, I was proud to introduce the Veterans HOPE Act to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans. Between 2010 and 2016, deaths due to opioid overdose rose by 65% among veterans. During those same years, veteran deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by roughly five-fold. Meanwhile, the rate of prescription opioid receipts within three months before death declined by more than 25%, suggesting that opioid overdoses are likely stemming from hard or synthetic drugs, without knowledge of the initial prescriber. To combat this issue, the Veterans HOPE Act would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to further investigate deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids. Upon conclusion of the study, the Secretary would report findings to the public and Congress and suggest veteran overdose prevention efforts to save lives. As a member of the North Carolina State Assembly, authoring the main legislative actions to combat the opioid crisis in North Carolina was one of my proudest achievements. Now as the U.S. Representative of a Congressional District with the fifth most veterans in America, the Veterans HOPE Act is especially important research to me. The data speaks for itselfveteran deaths caused by non-prescribed opioids like heroin and fentanyl have skyrocketed. But our veterans are more than a statistic. They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers who have selflessly sacrificed so much for our great nation. It is our duty to do all we can to protect them from the dangers of opioid addiction. You can read the bill here. District Highlights George Henry White Commemorative Stamp Act Honored to introduce legislation this week alongside several of my North Carolina colleagues to honor George Henry White of New Bern, a Republican politican and the last black member of Congress during Reconstruction. George Henry White courageously stood up to racial injustice in a hostile time period for African Americans, especially in the South. The cause of Civil Rights in this country was only advanced because of strong and brave leaders like him. It was only fitting that we honor such a historic African American figure during Black History Month. You can read more about his life and legacy here. Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office Almost one year after Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.'s passing, Im pleased that a bill I introduced in his honor advanced through the House of Representatives. This measure would designate a post office in his hometown of Farmville, the \"Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office.\" It was altogether fitting that my first piece of legislation as a member of Congress be a tribute to my predecessor, friend and mentor. Walter cared deeply for the people of eastern North Carolina, especially the Marines who serve at Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point and New River. He epitomized what a public servant stood forhis constituents. I greatly appreciate my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation for unanimously supporting this bill, and I hope the Senate and President Trump will swiftly act to make this bill a law. You can watch my remarks from the House floor in support of the bill below: Christina Koch Returns to Earth Congratulations to Christina Koch for completing her 328 day mission in space! Welcome back to planet Earth! Christina grew up in Jacksonville and attended NC State. Her time aboard the International Space Station set the record for the longest single continuous spaceflight by a female. Such a tremendous accomplishment for North Carolina, the United States of America and all of humanity. Welcome home, Christina! You can read more about her record-breaking flight here. District Work Even though I've been in our nation's capital for the past two weeks, I've met with numerous people and organizations from North Carolina, many of whom are from the Third District. Scroll through the photos below to see some of the people I met. Had a productive discussion about how Congress can impact state and local narcotic issues with Sgt. Kevin Black, Lt. Daniel Duckworth, Sgt. Mike Dawson, Special Agent Joe Barringer and Sgt. Jason Chappell. Enjoyed talking with representatives from the Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource Council. Forestry is such a vital part of the economy in eastern North Carolina. These gentlemen work at International Paper's facility in New Bern. I learned a great deal about this wonderful renewable resource. It was an honor meeting UNC Chapel Hill's Athletic Director, Bubba Cunningham, and other senior athletic department officials. We talked about college athletics and issues relating to student-athlete compensation that are affecting the NCAA. Met with Tom Gentile, President and CEO of Spirit AeroSystems to discuss their business and presence in North Carolina. Such an honor to attend the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit with President Trump and several of my colleagues from the North Carolina Congressional delegation. Cutting taxes and red tape has helped create jobs and raise wages across every demographic. We have helped stressed areas of our country by raising people out of poverty with jobs and pride. So much better than creating more government dependency. I will continue to support this administration and its pro-growth policies while serving the great people of eastern North Carolina. It was great meeting with Winston Salem Special Olympics athlete, Jennifer Wardlow, and President and CEO of Special Olympics North Carolina, Keith Fishburne. The Special Olympics is a truly fantastic organization. Honored to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, with several of my colleagues from the North Carolina delegation. Agriculture is extremely important in eastern North Carolina, and recent trade victories like USMCA and the Phase One trade agreement with China are big wins for American farmers. As a physician, I always enjoy discussing how we can improve America's healthcare system. Had a productive discussion with representatives from National Rural Health. Access, equity and quality of healthcare are especially important issues in places like eastern North Carolina. Thanks for reading! Thank you for signing up to receive my newsletter.

I am proud to announce that I have secured significant funding to start construction on the Arkansas Valley Conduit, which will provide clean drinking water for 50,000 Coloradans in 40 communities. This is&nbsp;the first time funding has been secured since Congress authorized the project and President Kennedy promised completion nearly six decades ago. The communities of the Lower Arkansas Valley deserve clean drinking water, which the Arkansas Valley Conduit will supply for generations to come. This is the first time robust federal funding of $28 million has been dedicated to the project which will help finish final design, pre-construction costs, and begin construction to get to the first community in need.&nbsp;In Pueblo last week I celebrated the good news with members of the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District and discussed the next steps on the project.&nbsp;Read more from the&nbsp;Pueblo Chieftain.  Learn More About My Guest to the&nbsp;State of the Union Address   Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;or the picture above to watch&nbsp;remarks from Senator Gardner and his State of the Union guest Kristen Christy on destigmatizing mental health.  I&#8217;m honored that&nbsp;Kristen Christy, the 2018 Air Force Spouse of the Year, attended the State of the Union Address as my guest.&nbsp;Kristen has experienced heartbreaking loss that no family should ever have to face. Through her strength and commitment to military families,&nbsp;Kristen has become an inspiring suicide prevention advocate and guiding light for the Air Force and entire military community as she helps others transition from post-traumatic stress to post-traumatic growth. Her resilience, courage, and her never-quit attitude exemplify the best of the American spirit, and it&#8217;s fitting that someone with her inspirational and moving story was in the room as the president highlighted the progress and opportunities for our great country. Meeting with&nbsp;Fort Carson&nbsp;Officials About Infrastructure Improvements and the Novel Coronavirus  I recently visited Fort Carson and&nbsp;received an update on Gate 19 construction and infrastructure improvement projects both on base and in the community. We also discussed the possibility of evacuees from the novel&nbsp;coronavirus outbreak being quarantined at Fort Carson. I appreciate the leadership on base that is organized and ready if needed to assist our nation's response and containment of this virus. I wrote to leaders on the Senate Appropriations Committee requesting that they work with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to&nbsp;ensure robust funding to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak. As the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;coronavirus continues to spread&nbsp;around the world, HHS, through a number of its agencies, is actively leading critical prevention, containment, and supply chain stability efforts.&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;must serve as a collaborative partner and ensure&nbsp;that there is sufficient funding for both current and potential future efforts to&nbsp;contain this communicable and deadly virus. Meeting with the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce  I recently&nbsp;had a great discussion with the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce Legislative Affairs Committee on water policy, transportation and housing issues, and ways we can work together to grow the economy and boost job creation in Colorado.&nbsp;I always&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;with Coloradans&nbsp;to&nbsp;gain their input on a variety of issues and help&nbsp;bring more of Colorado to Washington.&nbsp; New Renovations at the&nbsp;Colorado Springs Airport  &nbsp; I had a great visit at the Colorado Springs Airport to discuss renovations and growth, including&nbsp;plans for a new airtanker base and ramp&nbsp;to support firefighting efforts. Year after year, much of the West is forced to deal with horrible wildfires that burn millions of acres. Our firefighters risk everything to protect our communities and it's our duty to make sure they have every possible tool to safely fight wildfires. This&nbsp;new&nbsp;airtanker base will serve as an incredible resource for firefighters in Colorado and surrounding areas. Providing&nbsp;Student Loan Relief&nbsp;for&nbsp;Colorado&nbsp;Students In November, the Department of Education announced it would cancel the loans taken out by students to attend the Art Institute of Colorado between January 20, 2018&nbsp;&#8211; when the school lost its accreditation&nbsp;&#8211; and December 31, 2018 &#8211; when they shut their doors.&nbsp;Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) and I urged&nbsp;Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to extend the school discharge eligibility period because the relief is incomplete and does not relieve students of the debt they took on to attend the school prior to January 20, 2018, which is now worthless.&nbsp;At our&nbsp;urging, the Department of Education agreed to expand student loan forgiveness&nbsp;for those who attended the Art Institute of Colorado at the time the school lost its accreditation, meaning more Colorado students will receive full relief on federal loans still owed, as well as a refund of loans they have already paid.  Supporting&nbsp;Sugar Beet Farmers&nbsp;After&nbsp;Adverse Weather Conditions The past two years have been devastating for Cooperative farmers working in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, and Wyoming due to significant weather events. In 2018 and 2019, growing regions across these states experienced freezing temperatures in early October before sugar beets are typically harvested.&nbsp;I sent a bipartisan letter with Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) and a bipartisan group of our colleagues&nbsp;urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to take immediate action&nbsp;in implementing the sugar beet eligibility provisions that were passed in the Fiscal Year 2020 Appropriations bill as part of the Wildfire, Hurricane, and Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+). This program has been essential for farmers during adverse weather growing seasons,&nbsp;and USDA&#8217;s swift action is necessary in order for farmers to obtain operating loans for the 2020 crop.  Meeting Taiwan&#8217;s&nbsp;Vice President-Elect Lai Ching-te  I was honored to meet with Taiwan&#8217;s Vice President-elect Lai Ching-te recently&nbsp;and reaffirm that the U.S.&nbsp;Congress will continue to advocate on behalf of Taiwan as guided by U.S.&nbsp;law, including the Taiwan Relations Act, the Taiwan Travel Act, and my&nbsp;Asia Reassurance Initiative Act. I also relayed my concerns with the World Health Organization excluding Taiwan as the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;coronavirus spreads around the globe. As China continues its aggressive campaign to delegitimize Taiwan, it&#8217;s critically important for the U.S.&nbsp;to reaffirm our support for Taiwan.

This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year. This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model. It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference. In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area. I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our country&#8217;s food and agriculture interests. Read more here,&nbsp;  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products. The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.&nbsp;I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient. This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.&nbsp;For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products. Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store. Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as &#8220;milk&#8221;. I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law. Read more here.&nbsp;  Dropping the Puck in Glens Falls to Stick It to Cancer and Helping Kids Learn to Skate   This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the community \"Try Hockey for Free\" event in Glens Falls, where I helped introduce many young constituents&nbsp;to the sport of hockey. This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game. NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!  Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce.&nbsp;   It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing. In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease. I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases. I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.   I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards. I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress. Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events. The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees. This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires. Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance. This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base. Read more here.  Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving on&#8239;our embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts. This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted. As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical. Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders. Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots. We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and I&#8217;m honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress. Read more here.  Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown. The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities.&nbsp; Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns. Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities. I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.

Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for \"absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies\" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases. Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines &#8211; though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks.  \"New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,\" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

The blast injured dozens of workers, and it took the lives of six: Peter&nbsp;Chepulis, Raymond&nbsp;Dobratz, Kenneth Haskell, Roy&nbsp;Rushton, Chris Walters, and one of my close friends, Ron Crabb. On Sunday, I was in Middletown along with colleagues, community leaders, and friends and family of those who were lost in the tragic accident, to honor and remember those who never came home that day. Ten years ago, workplace safety laws failed these six individuals, and the dozens of others who were injured in the blast. Nothing can ever make up for the lives lost that day, but we have a responsibility as a community and as a Congress to ensure we do all we can to protect America&#8217;s workers. Last year, on the 9th&nbsp;anniversary of the explosion, I introduced the Protecting America&#8217;s Workers Act (PAWA) to strengthen and modernize the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) &#8211; which hasn&#8217;t been meaningfully updated by Congress in over 50 years. The bill is simple, and contains some common-sense measures like improving whistleblower protections; requiring the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to investigate all cases of death and series injuries that occur within a place of employment; and establishing rights for families of workers who were killed on the job by giving them the right to meet with OSHA investigators, receive copies of citations, and more. The lives lost ten years ago deserve to be honored with action. To read how PAWA makes workplaces safer, click here to visit my website.        Rep. Courtney joined community leaders, friends, and families at a memorial service for those lost in the Kleen Energy explosion     Bipartisan Action on Surprise Health Care Billing  Surprise medical bills are a crisis waiting to happen for so many families in eastern Connecticut and across the country. When people are ill, the last thing they should have to worry about is how to safeguard themselves against complex billing technicalities that result in surprise, sky-high medical bills. The cost of health care is a top-line issue for folks in our region, and surprise billing is a major contributor &#8211; my office has received far too many calls from people in eastern Connecticut who have not been treated fairly.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve already taken steps in the House to curb the cost of prescription medication, and this week we took on surprise billing. On Tuesday, my colleagues and I on the house Education &amp; Labor Committee voted to approve the bipartisan Ban Surprise Billing Act (H.R. 5800), a bill that would protect patients from devastating surprise medical bills, and would finally give them the financial confidence and peace of mind they deserve. These protections would be for everyone &#8211; for people who receive health care through their employer, and for those who are enrolled in the individual market. Erica Moser did a great job covering the ins and outs of the bill in her article for The Day, click here to read more. One of the most exciting parts about H.R. 5800 is that it&#8217;s so bipartisan &#8211; it was supported by both the Democratic Chairman of the Committee, and by the Republican Ranking Member. People in Congressional Districts across America are impacted by surprise medical bills, and it&#8217;s great to see Members from both sides of the aisle coming together to address the problem. I commend Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for working together to advance this bipartisan bill, I was proud to support it, and I&#8217;m looking forward to voting to pass it when it comes before the House for a final vote.        Click here to watch Rep. Courtney's remarks in favor of H.R. 5800     Meeting with National Defense University Students  On Tuesday, I hosted a large group of students from the National Defense University&#8217;s Eisenhower School to discuss some of the top priorities on the horizon for our Armed Forces and the industrial base, and to learn more about their work as students focusing on undersea warfare. As always, these NDU students were totally impressive &#8211; they came to study in Washington from all across the U.S., represented a variety of branches, backgrounds, agencies, and experiences, and were sharp and well informed on our national security strategy and priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our conversation turned in large part to the flurry of activity we&#8217;ve seen in Connecticut&#8217;s defense manufacturing sector recently. Up and down the supply chain, skilled manufacturers and small companies&nbsp;are seeing new opportunities for work. Connecticut&#8217;s defense manufacturing is booming, but even that good news presents its own challenges &#8211; mainly, how can we make sure that we have a workforce that&#8217;s skilled and well educated enough to take advantage of these new opportunities? The answer to that question has been the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board&#8217;s revolutionary job skills training program, the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative (MPI). The MPI was kick-started with a $6 million federal grant that I helped to procure back in 2015, and since then it&#8217;s flourished alongside our state&#8217;s burgeoning manufacturing sector. The MPI has helped Electric Boat (EB) to grow by thousands of employees in just a few short years. In the last year alone, EB reported that they made over 1,000 hires directly from the pipeline. The MPI is exactly what was needed to fill the ranks of a booming manufacturing sector, and its been a total success for our region. It was great to host this impressive class of National Defense University students in Washington this week, and to discuss with them all of the moving parts that must work in unison to deliver the tools are Navy and Armed Forces need.        Students from the National Defense University met with Rep. Courtney at his Washington, DC office &nbsp;     The Start of a Months-Long Budget Process&nbsp;  Earlier this week, the White House released their official 2021 budget request. Ultimately it is Congress&#8217;s job to craft and pass a budget through the House and the Senate, and it&#8217;s the President's job to sign it. However, the start of the budget negotiation process typically begins with the White House&#8217;s budget request &#8211; their &#8220;proposed budget&#8221; &#8211; and this year we&#8217;re off to a strange start.&nbsp; The White House&#8217;s proposed budget makes $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other health care programs over the next 10 years. It also slashes investments that help workers find and keep good paying jobs, and altogether eliminates bedrock programs that help fund America&#8217;s public education system. Thankfully, this is just the start of a months-long budget negotiation process. The proposed budget introduced by the White House yesterday has already received criticism from both sides of the aisle, and it&#8217;s not going to make it through Congress as-is. It&#8217;s not encouraging to see the White House kick the process off with a budget proposal that points so many important programs in the wrong direction, but as the House moves into our own budget negotiating process, we have an opportunity to work together across the aisle to get it right. It will remain our top priority in the House to protect and defend the health, financial security, and well-being of millions of Americans as we begin debate on the 2021&nbsp;budget.  &nbsp;   Proposed Shipbuilding Budget Receives Bipartisan Criticism&nbsp; One of the components of the 2021 budget request that has generated significant bipartisan concern is the plan to cut back on shipbuilding investment for our Navy. Congress had traditionally worked together to provide strong support for the Navy&#8217;s plans to build, modernize and support a strong fleet of ships, submarines, destroyers and other vessels critical to our national defense. Contrary to expectations, however, the budget we received this week took a significant step backwards &#8211; proposing to purchase just 7 ships, a sharp reduction from the 10 that the Trump&nbsp;Administration itself&nbsp;planned for this year and a nearly 20% reduction in the budget for shipbuilding. Incredibly, one of the cuts included the reduction of a Virginia-class submarine, with only one requested in 2021. This plan flies in the face of more than a decade of testimony from our defense leaders about the unmatched value of our submarine force and increasing alarm about shortfalls in the fleet. It&#8217;s even in direct contradiction with the Trump Administration's own plans for our Navy and defense strategy. Given that every submarine we build will be in service for four decades, the decision to plan for only one new submarine next year is short-sighted. As Chairman of the House&nbsp;Seapower&nbsp;and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I can say with certainly that this budget is dead on arrival. Throughout the week, bipartisan concern about this proposal has grown across Congress and I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to dig into this surprising plan as we begin our work on the 2021 budget.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Homeland Security for Children Act (), the DHS Acquisition Reform Act of 2019 (), the providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2546) to designate certain lands in the State of Colorado as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes; providing for consideration of the joint resolution () removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment; and for other purposes. (), the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act (), the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act (), and the removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment (). Budget season has officially begun. Earlier this week, I received the President&#8217;s budget request for Fiscal Year 2021. While Congress holds the Article I powers of the Constitution, or the &#8220;power of the purse,&#8221; the President&#8217;s budget outlines his vision for the nation.&nbsp;The release of the President&#8217;s budget request historically kicks off the congressional budget process in both the House and the Senate. It serves as a starting point for lawmakers to make spending decisions and analyze the economic outlook for the coming year. The framework of the budget process can be divided up into :   President submits the budget to Congress House and Senate mark up and pass budget House and Senate conference the budget resolution Consideration and passage of Appropriations bills Consideration of reconciliation/authorization Start of new Fiscal Year (October 1st)   I applaud President Trump for putting forward a budget proposal. That&#8217;s more than we can say for the People&#8217;s House, where, for the second straight year, the Democrat majority has failed to produce a budget. That&#8217;s not leadership.  This is interesting to me because, on the House Budget Committee majority&#8217;s website, there is a section titled &#8220;Responsibility.&#8221; The first sentence in this section reads, &#8220;The Committee&#8217;s chief responsibility is to draft an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that provides a congressional framework for spending and revenue levels, the federal surplus or deficit, and public debt.&#8221;  In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done. Yet, here in the House, in the greatest country in the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget. Simply put, a failure to budget is a failure to govern.  We must start doing our job to put our country on a sustainable, responsible fiscal path. This is our duty to the American people, not promoting budget-busting policies, including Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, that will leave future generations saddled with the consequences of House Democrats&#8217; eagerness to spend with no way to pay. It&#8217;s time for Democrats to stop punting one of our most basic responsibilities in Congress. I&#8217;m ready for them to join us at the table to do the difficult work.  While we can&#8217;t analyze the Democrats&#8217; budget &#8211; because they won&#8217;t put one forth &#8211; the House Budget Committee did hold a hearing on the President&#8217;s FY 2021 budget proposal with&nbsp;OMB&nbsp;Acting Director Russell Vought. As we discussed, the proposal seeks to balance our fiscal constraints with the need to fund the priorities of the country, including national defense. The President&#8217;s budget includes deficit reduction measures, specifically $4.6 trillion between 2021-2030. This is a strong start, but more work remains to be done to put our country on a solid fiscal path. Moving forward, it is imperative that we work together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to advance a budget that funds our nation&#8217;s important priorities while acknowledging our very real fiscal challenges. You can read my full opening remarks .  MEETINGS  In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! It was a pleasure to meet with Keturah Finch and Tanner Arnwine of Bentonville to talk about neurofibromatosis&nbsp;(NF), a genetic, tumor-generating disorder. We discussed research through the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) and the National Institutes of Health, as well as its value to civilians, warfighters, and veterans suffering from&nbsp;NF. Novel research has led to a new era of medical breakthroughs for a variety of illnesses, but there is still much more work to be done across many fields. We must continue to make smart investments that build our pipeline of science, research, and medical discovery. The next morning, I invited my Republican House Budget Committee colleagues to join me at the Office of Budget and Management to hear more about the President&#8217;s recently released budget proposal, as well as fiscal priorities of the White House. As I mentioned earlier, I appreciate the Administration for drafting a budget. Congress should be doing the same thing, but House Democrats have refused to put forth a proposal yet again. In the real world, everyday Americans and Arkansans are held accountable for their income, expenses, and savings. Main Street job creators and business leaders are held accountable for demonstrating fiscal restraint, for making tough choices, and for setting priorities. Congress should not be any different. But in the House, Democrats are refusing to put forth the very document that tells us what we need to know about how much we&#8217;re spending, what we&#8217;re raising in revenue, and the impact of our deficits and debt on our economy and the nation. The American people deserve better.  Representatives from NorthWest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) were in Washington, and I had the opportunity to hear some important school and curriculum updates. We talked about enhancing Career and Technical Education (CTE), the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act &#8211; which I voted for &#8211; and the National Science Foundation&#8217;s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. NWACC just received an ATE grant for a project that will create a Technical Certificate in Integrated Design to help expand the skilled technical workforce, especially in construction fields and engineering design. NWACC is helping prepare our students for the jobs of today and the future, and I appreciate their dedication to providing quality education and opportunities in the Third District. I thank Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson, Dr. Ricky Tompkins, Jim Hall, Rachel Harris, and DeAnne Witherspoon for their time and work!  I then met with the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police. I always appreciate meeting with our law enforcement officers and hearing more about their work to protect and serve our communities. We discussed many issues, including The Protect and Serve Act (HR 1325). I&#8217;m a cosponsor of this legislation, which creates new federal penalties for individuals who deliberately attack or attempt to cause significant bodily injury to any law enforcement officer. This bill aims to deter attacks against police officers who have increasingly been targeted and face higher levels of hostility because of the uniform they wear. I&#8217;m extremely thankful for the work of the men and women who wear the badge each day!  My next meeting was with the Enlisted Association of the Arkansas National Guard. It was wonderful to sit down with Arkansas National Guard members from Fort Smith and other parts of the state to talk about their work, duties, and programs that support their efforts. We also had a productive discussion on the National Guard&#8217;s role going forward in the Space and Cyber domains. The Arkansas Air National Guard has both Space and Cyber missions. As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas Army&nbsp;National Guard, I salute their service and thank them for their commitment to the Natural State and our nation! I then welcomed Dr. John Lorsch, Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, to my office to speak about the Institutional Development Award (IDea) program and its impact on Arkansas. Our conversations focused on the NIH&#8217;s research and biomedical investments within the Natural State.  I wrapped up the day at the National Guard Association, where I joined National Guard members from across the country to talk about defense efforts, legislative advocacy, and my work on the House Budget Committee. I shared stories about my time in uniform, as well as my perspectives on appropriations work in Congress. I talked about the constrained resource environment we face, and how growing mandatory spending is squeezing the portion of discretionary funding available for national priorities. The Guard brings great value to the fight, and it was my honor to talk to this great group and answer questions.  The next morning, I met with Dan Hendrix, President and CEO of the World Trade Center Arkansas. I appreciated an update on their work, economic development in the community, small business grants, and the impact of recent trade deals on the state. Arkansas is a state of opportunity, and the World Trade Center Arkansas is a pivotal resource that has supported bilateral trade services, global connections, and export development programs for local businesses.  Our region is full of opportunity, and it was great to speak with students from the Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program. FLEX students spend an academic year in the U.S. living with a volunteer host family and attending high school. The students, who are from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are currently living and going to school in Russellville and Springdale! They said that they have learned a lot during their time living and studying in the region &#8211; and that they love the sense of community in Arkansas! &nbsp;  Modernized infrastructure is vital to keeping our communities economically competitive and strong. It was great to wrap up my week in Washington with Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.&nbsp;We had very productive conversations on rural infrastructure grants, local projects like I-49 and regional airport improvements, and budget and appropriations.&nbsp;We also highlighted the importance of addressing U.S. infrastructure needs using smart and effective methods that provide results and maximize our resources. Today, I also want to wish everyone &#8211; especially my wonderful wife, Terri &#8211; a Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day! I'm grateful that my office was able to present some special valentines to residents at Methodist Village Senior Living in Fort Smith. Spreading some cheer and happiness is what this day is all about! I&#8217;m looking forward to being back in the district and traveling the Natural State next week. Wishing everyone a Happy Presidents&#8217;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;on Monday! Let us reflect and honor the leaders who've held our nation's highest office to serve the American people. By swearing an oath to &#8220;preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,&#8221; they each answered the call to lead our great country throughout history.

This harmful plan allows states to receive a waiver to block grant their Medicaid programs for certain low-income Medicaid recipients, and would have the impact of weakening the entire program and pushing Medicaid recipients off their much-needed, life-saving health care coverage. These block grants are just the latest in a slew of attempts by this Administration to gut the Affordable Care Act&#8212;and the numerous coverage expansions that it has offered to millions of Americans, of all ages and backgrounds, who were unable to gain affordable coverage before&#8212;and the millions more who could gain coverage in my home state of Texas expands Medicaid. I am proud that my resolution demonstrated our Democratic majority&#8217;s strong opposition to removing the expanded protections that the Affordable Care Act provided to primarily childless adults and those parents who are living at or below the poverty line.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;            Watch my video condemning this Administration&#8217;s latest assault on affordable and accessible health care. &nbsp;    Millions of hard-working Americans have finally been able to gain affordable health insurance&#8212;now the Trump administration wants to take away the progress made by these Americans&#8212;and undercut access to health care. And they also want to chip away at access to health care for millions of Americans who have and will be able to gain coverage through state Medicaid expansions.  That is why I&nbsp;am proud to lead this resolution, and I am proud to fight for affordable and accessible health care each and every day.  Sincerely,    Marc Veasey  P.s.

To that end, as Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I recently joined House leadership&nbsp;in unveiling the&nbsp;Moving Forward Framework&nbsp;&#8211; a five-year, $760 billion investment in infrastructure that would&shy; fix some of the country&#8217;s most urgent infrastructure needs. From addressing the massive road and transit maintenance backlog, to designing safer streets, to putting the U.S. on a path toward zero emissions from the transportation sector and increasing resiliency, the Moving Forward Framework charts a course for investment and reform.&nbsp;The framework put forth&nbsp;will transform the federal role in helping communities around the country undertake projects that are&nbsp;smarter, safer, and made to last.&nbsp;       LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK    Our country has changed dramatically since the 1950s, yet people and goods are now literally stuck trying to move on transportation networks developed nearly 70 years ago.&nbsp;It&#8217;s past time for transformational investments to make our infrastructure smarter, safer, and resilient to climate&nbsp;change, or else we will keep throwing money at an antiquated system that is only holding us and our economy back.&nbsp;The Moving Forward Framework&nbsp;is the launchpad we need to get our existing infrastructure working again and create an estimated 10 million jobs, while reducing &nbsp;carbon pollution, dramatically improving safety, and spurring economic activity. In the coming months, I look forward to continuing our work to make this framework a reality. The cost of inaction is too great.&nbsp; The transportation sector is the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States. That is why I am writing comprehensive legislation that will meaningfully tackle carbon pollution by funding more and better transit service, expanding Amtrak&#8217;s passenger rail services, requiring states to report on greenhouse gas emissions, and focusing on maintaining what we have rather than building new and bigger highways.&nbsp; This framework invests in alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling, walking, and public transportation, to get Americans to work safely while reducing congestion and our carbon footprint.  In addition to combatting carbon pollution, safety will be front and center to this legislation. Last year more than 37,000 people died on American roads, and the number of pedestrians and cyclists killed has risen at a startling rate. The Moving Forward Framework will invest $10 billion in road safety over the next five years and will require states to prioritize safety when planning projects. The Moving Forward Framework marks an exciting and necessary shift in how the United States plans, builds, and maintains its infrastructure. Putting carbon pollution, safety, and improvements to bring our existing infrastructure up to a state of good repair first will help our communities make better investments that reflect the needs and desires of the American public.&nbsp; Investing in Oregon&#8217;s Ports and Harbors I am excited to announce that I have secured nearly $11 million in new funds from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to support dredging at the ports of Coos Bay, Siuslaw, Gold Beach, and the Coquille River. These dredging projects are vital to supporting the economic health of coastal communities and ensuring the safety of mariners. Without routine dredging, these ports would quickly fill in with silt, become unsafe and eventually unusable.  The recent funding is just a down payment on much larger needs on the Oregon Coast, including repairs and improvements on jetties at most coastal ports. That&#8217;s why earlier this year I introduced legislation which passed the House to ensure that the USACE fully utilizes all revenues from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for its intended purpose: harbor maintenance.  I am currently drafting and plan to pass later this year a new Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which will make sure Oregon harbors receive their fair share of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, improve dam safety, and ensure greater resilience from climate change. With the passage of WRDA, we can ensure that Oregon&#8217;s ports receive the dredging and jetty repair funds they need. Fighting for Clean Water The Trump administration is moving forward with two proposals that will have long-lasting impacts on our public health and environment, as well as cost taxpayers more money in the long run. First, the Trump administration recently released its final &#8220;Dirty Water Rule,&#8221; the single largest effort to rollback clean water protections in our nation&#8217;s history. Access to clean water is a right, not a privilege. However, the Trump administration is rolling back decades-old Clean Water Act protections that aim to make our rivers and streams safe for fishing and swimming, &nbsp;including eliminating protections for thousands of miles of small streams, leaving half of our nation&#8217;s wetlands at risk for destruction, and putting the drinking water of over 117 million people at risk. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that the Dirty Water Rule will eliminate clean water protections on between 18 to 71 percent of the nation&#8217;s stream and river miles, and over 50 percent of wetlands. Yet, in spite of my repeated requests, EPA political appointees have refused to quantify the exact scope and nature of waters that will lose Clean Water Act protections &#8211; failing to let communities know if the Dirty Water Rule could harm or destroy locally-important waterbodies. The Trump administration also announced in early January that it is moving forward with plans to amend the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to, among other things, allow Federal agencies to ignore the impacts of climate change when developing and planning infrastructure projects. When tackling new and critical infrastructure projects across the country, we need to consider the range of impacts to our environment. Pretending like our climate isn&#8217;t changing is reckless and costly.&nbsp; NEPA ensures the environmental impacts of a proposed project are examined and that the public has a role in the decision-making process. Not only is weakening NEPA requirements a bad idea for public health and the environment, but it will end up costing taxpayers more when projects aren&#8217;t built to be resilient. Unfortunately, this administration has consistently put the interests of industry first and appears hell-bent on taking us back to an era when our nation&#8217;s rivers were so polluted, they caught on fire and the Willamette River was an open sewer. Americans deserve better. I will continue to use all the tools at my disposal to stop the Trump Administration from its reckless rollbacks of our clean water protections and considerations of climate change when planning Federal infrastructure projects.

Yvette D. Clarke's DHS Climate Change Research Act  in the House of Representatives &nbsp; Last night, my&nbsp;bill,&nbsp;H.R. 4737, the&nbsp;Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Climate Change Research Act&nbsp;passed in the U.S. House of Representatives. The DHS Climate Change Research Act takes important action to address America&#8217;s national security concerns in the face of our changing climate. Climate Change is not only an existential threat to our planet, it is also a major national security risk to Americans at home and abroad. Today, more than ever, it is critical that we understand both the impacts that climate change is having across the globe, as well as the implications of these impacts to our national security. Specifically, the DHS Climate Change Research Act will:    ensure that the Department of Homeland Security fulfills its mission of conducting research to advance homeland security; direct the Science and Technology Directorate to conduct analysis and technological research on how DHS can confront climate change; implement a high level of accountability to the American public by mandating annual reporting to Congress regarding the research and projects that DHS has undertaken in the previous year.  It is critical that we address the homeland security implications of climate change in greater depth. I am happy that Congress took bold steps to addressing this crisis by passing my critical legislation which safeguards communities across the nation from future climate impacts.&nbsp;  &nbsp;       Washington, D.C.&nbsp;Office 2058 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20515Phone: (202) 225-6231  Brooklyn&nbsp;Office 222 Lenox Road, Suites 1 &amp; 2Brooklyn, NY 11226Phone: (718) 287-1142            Stay Connected    Unsubscribe            &nbsp;    ","district":"11","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"NY","party":"Democrat","score":2.4139705},{"name":"Representative Sean Patrick Maloney","address":"NY18SMIMA@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-11","subject":"UPDATE","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }    I just voted to protect Hudson Valley workers and support their right to unionize.&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;&#8204;&nbsp;    News from Congressman Maloney                        &nbsp; Home About Member About District News Contact &nbsp;             &nbsp;       Lindsey Cormack,  I just voted to protect Hudson Valley workers and support their right to unionize.

When my dad got out of the Navy, he and my mother were able to buy a house, raise a family, and even put 5 kids through college &#8211; all while saving up enough to retire after a lifetime of hard work. Every family who works hard and saves up should be able to achieve this American dream, but today that kind of financial stability seems like nothing more than a fantasy. The&nbsp;ability to retire and live with dignity is constantly under attack by far-right politicians and corporations. They&#8217;re trying to roll back worker protections, and they&#8217;re throwing everything they&#8217;ve got at us.  I am fighting back to protect the rights of workers and help set a higher standard of living for families across our state.

The impeachment trial is both a symptom of our times and another example of our division. At the beginning of our nation, we did not have an impeachment inquiry of a president for almost 100 years with the partisan impeachment of Andrew Johnson. After more than 100 years, another impeachment inquiry was conducted when the House began a formal impeachment inquiry into President Nixon in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410-4. Within a period of weeks, President Nixon resigned before he was formally impeached. Then, just over two decades later, President Clinton was impeached by the House, on another mostly partisan vote leading to a partisan acquittal in the Senate.&nbsp;  This season of our history and has been referred to as the Age of Investigations and the Age of Impeachment. We have had multiple special counsels since 1974 over multiple topics. This is more than just oversight; it has been a unique time in American history when the politics of the moment have driven rapid calls for investigation and impeachment. Over the past three years, the House of Representatives has voted four times to open an impeachment inquiry: once in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019. Only the second vote in 2019 actually passed and began a formal inquiry.&nbsp;  The Mueller investigation that consumed most of 2018 and 2019 answered many questions about Russian attacks on our voting systems&#8212;though no votes were changed&#8212;but it was also a $32 million investigation that took more than two years of America&#8217;s attention. For the last four months the country has been consumed with impeachment hearings and investigations. The first rumors of issues with Ukraine arose August 28 when Politico published a story about US foreign aid being slow-walked for Ukraine, and then on September 18 when The&nbsp;Washington Post published a story about a whistleblower report that claimed President Trump pressured an unnamed foreign head of state to do an investigation for his campaign.&nbsp;  Within days of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Washington Post story on September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House would begin hearings to impeach the President, which led to the formal House vote to open the impeachment inquiry on October 31 and then a vote to impeach the President on December 18th. But after the partisan vote to impeach the President, Speaker Pelosi held the articles of impeachment for a month before turning them over to the Senate, which began the formal trial of the President of the United States on January 16, 2020. After hearing hours of arguments from both House Managers and the President&#8217;s legal defense team and Senators asking 180 questions to both sides, the trial concluded February 5, 2020. Key Dates to Know&nbsp;   April 21, 2019 - President Zelensky is elected President of Ukraine. May 21 - President Zelensky sworn in. After the ceremony, President Zelensky abolishes Parliament and calls for quick (snap) elections on July 21. July 21 &#8211; Ukrainian Parliamentary elections.

Important Context of What Was Happening in Ukraine  Ukraine became independent in 1991 when it broke away from the Soviet Union, but the Ukrainians have faced constant pressure from Russia ever since. In 2014 Ukraine forced out its pro-Russia president, and Moscow retaliated by taking over Crimea (and stealing the Ukrainian Navy), then rolling tanks into eastern Ukraine and taking all of eastern Ukraine by force. Russian and Ukrainian troops continue to fight every day in eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;  The people of Ukraine face an aggressive Russia on the east and pervasive Soviet era corruption throughout the government and the business community. President Trump met the previous President of Ukraine in 2017 to talk about other countries helping Ukraine with greater military support funds and to ask how Ukraine could address corruption on a wider scale. The two Presidents also spoke about lethal aid (allowing the Ukrainians to buy sniper rifles, anti-tank javelin missiles, and other lethal supplies) to help them fight the invading Russians. The US also started sending a couple hundred American troops to train Ukrainian soldiers in the far west of Ukraine.&nbsp;  Ukrainian&nbsp;President Zelensky  On April 21, 2019, President Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected as the new President of Ukraine. He was a sitcom actor/comedian who had no political experience, but was well known for his television show in which he played the part of a corruption-fighting teacher who was elected as President of Ukraine. His television popularity helped him win the election, but when he was sworn in on May 21, he was relatively unknown to most of the world.&nbsp;  On the same day as his inauguration, May 21, President Zelensky abolished Parliament and called for snap elections to put his party in power. With a new president in place and parliamentary elections in Ukraine coming, starting in June of 2019, the President ordered foreign aid to Ukraine to be held until the end of the fiscal year, but agencies were informed that they should do all the preliminary work needed before the aid was sent, so it would be ready to release at a moment&#8217;s notice. The leadership in Ukraine was not notified that there was a hold on their foreign aid.&nbsp;  The new Parliament was elected on July 21, and President Zelensky&#8217;s party won by a landslide. By mid-August, the new Parliament was working on anti-corruption efforts and trying to establish a High Court on Corruption, which they put in place September 5, 2019. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the early days of the new administration, but by mid August there was clear evidence of actual change in a country that desperately needed a new direction from its corrupt past.&nbsp;  President Trump&#8217;s Phone Call to President Zelensky  On July 25, when President Trump called President Zelensky, the President congratulated President Zelensky for the big win in Parliament and talked about &#8220;burden-sharing&#8221; (other nations also paying their share of support for Ukraine). The two presidents talked about their disapproval of the previous ambassadors to each other&#8217;s countries. But instead of following all the staff preparation notes written by Lt. Col Vindman, the National Security Council staffer assigned to Ukraine, and just talking about &#8220;corruption&#8221; in general, the President brought up a question about Ukraine and the 2016 election interference, which I will note below. President Zelensky also brought up to President Trump that his staff was planning to meet with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, in the coming days, which led to a conversation about Joe Biden and the firing of the previous prosecutor in Ukraine.&nbsp;  After the call, Lt. Col Vindman contacted an attorney at the National Security Council to express his &#8220;policy concerns&#8221; about the call. It is interesting to note that Lt. Col. Vindman&#8217;s boss, Tim Morrison, was also on the call, but he did not see any problems or concerns with the call according to his own testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. Within a month a whistleblower filed a report about the call, saying he heard about the call second-hand and was concerned about the implications of a conversation about elections on a head-of-state call. To keep the July 25th call in context with other news, the day before it took place&#8212;July 24&#8212;Robert Mueller had testified before Congress as the last official act to close down the two-and-a-half-year Mueller investigation and clear the President and his campaign team of any further accusation of election interference.&nbsp;  During the impeachment trial in the Senate, the House Managers repeated over and over that the President was planning to cheat &#8220;again&#8221; on the next election, but the final conclusion of the Mueller Report was &#8220;ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the (Trump) Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.&#8221;&nbsp;  This is especially notable, because for years a rumor circulated that Ukraine was part of the 2016 election interference and that someone in Ukraine was hiding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server that was hacked by the Russians in 2016. As the conspiracy theory goes, it was actually the Ukrainians that hacked the DNC, not the Russians. This is the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory that President Trump asked President Zelensky to help solve during the call.&nbsp;  Agencies of the US Intelligence Community have stated over and over that they did not believe that Ukraine was involved in the Russian election interference from 2016. I personally agree with the Intelligence Community assessment. But Rudy Giuliani, and multiple others around President Trump believed there was a secret plan in 2016 to hurt President Trump&#8217;s election from Ukraine. This accusation was amplified by bits of truth, including that the Ukrainian Ambassador to the US wrote an editorial in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 right before the election, and several other Ukrainian officials publicly spoke out against candidate Trump in 2016.&nbsp;  There is nothing illegal about a foreign nation speaking out for or against a presidential candidate, whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in 2016, or anyone else in the future. It may not be wise to take sides before an election, but it is not illegal. Just because some Ukrainian officials took sides, does not mean that the whole Ukrainian government worked on a cyberattack on our elections. But since this rumor had persisted, and it was a new administration now in Ukraine, President Trump asked President Zelensky to help clear up the facts if he could. That is certainly not illegal or improper, and it is certainly not something that could help the President in the 2020 election, especially since the 2016 Russian election accusation had just been closed the day before.&nbsp; &nbsp; The 2016 &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory is the issue that President Trump asked President Zelensky to &#8220;do us a favor&#8221; about, not the Biden&#8217;s or Burisma. During the July 25 call after the question about &#8220;Crowdstrike,&#8221; President Zelensky mentioned to President Trump that one of his advisers would be meeting with Rudy Giuliani soon. Then, President Trump affirmed that meeting and encouraged them to talk about the Biden investigation and the firing of the Ukrainian Prosecutor.&nbsp;  That may seem out of the blue, but in Washington, DC, that week, the city was buzzing about a Washington Post article that had been written three days before (July 22, 2019) detailing Hunter Biden&#8217;s giant salary ($83,000 per month) for doing essentially nothing for a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company and how it undercut Vice President Biden&#8217;s message on corruption.&nbsp;  It is important to get the context of that week to understand the context of the phone call that day. I have no doubt that the story was just as big of news in Kiev, Ukraine as it was in Washington, DC, that week. President Trump&#8217;s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had been in and out of Ukraine since November 2018, meeting with government officials and trying to find out more about the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory or any other Ukrainian connection to the 2016 election. During that time Rudy Giuliani met several former prosecutors from Ukraine who blamed their departure on Vice President Biden. It is clear that Rudy Giuliani was working to gain information about both of these issues in his capacity as President Trump&#8217;s private attorney.&nbsp;  It is not criminal for Rudy Giuliani to work on opposition research for a presidential campaign or to work on behalf of his client to clear his name from any issues related to the 2016 campaign, which he had done since November 2018. Some have stated that since this was &#8220;foreign information,&#8221; it is illegal. That is absolutely not true. In fact, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee in 2016 paid a British citizen, Christopher Steele, to work his contacts in Russia to create the now debunked &#8220;Steele Dossier&#8221; which the FBI used to open its investigation into President Trump, leading directly to the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller. That &#8220;Dossier&#8221; was opposition research done in Russia by a British citizen, paid for by the Clinton campaign team. Their opposition research was not illegal, but the use and abuse of that document by the FBI to start an investigation was certainly inappropriate and is most likely illegal. But, the FBI warrant issue is still being investigated by the ongoing Durham probe.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, when President Zelensky brought up the issue of Rudy Giuliani and President Trump replied to his statement. You can argue that President Trump should not have discussed the issue with President Zelensky when he brought it up, but it is certainly not illegal or impeachable to talk about it, especially when there are serious questions about Hunter Biden&#8217;s work with Burisma. That is not a conservative conspiracy theory; the issue of Hunter Biden&#8217;s employment in Ukraine was a problem for years at the State Department. It had been raised to Vice President Biden when he was still in office. Every State Department official interviewed for the Trump impeachment investigation noted that at best it was a clear conflict of interest and it was the center of a huge story on corruption in the Washington Post on July 22, 2019. It had the appearance of high-level corruption by using a well-placed family member on the board of a known corrupt gas company in Ukraine to shelter it from prosecutors. Hunter Biden had only resigned from the Burisma board a few months before the July 25 phone call, just prior to when his dad announced his run for the Presidency in 2019.&nbsp;  After the July 25 phone call, Attorney General Barr did not have any follow up meetings or calls with Ukrainian officials. Rudy Giuliani did have additional conversations with Ukrainian officials, which are legal to do since he is a private attorney representing the President.&nbsp;  Text of July 25, 2019 Phone Call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky:  The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.  President Zelensky: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.   The President: (laughter) That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.  President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.   The President: Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she &#183;doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.  President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.  The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.  President Zelensky: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.. That I can assure you.   The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.  President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.  The President: Well, she's going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.  President Zelensky: I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for your support.  The President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.  The President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. President.   The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.  President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.   &nbsp;  Based on a whistleblower report about the July 25 call, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the report on September 13 and started its impeachment inquiry on September 24.&nbsp;  Senate Trial  House Managers&#8217; Case for Impeachment&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, House Managers stated their belief that the President had carried out a &#8220;scheme to cheat in the 2020 election&#8221; by withholding financial aid to Ukraine and withholding a White House meeting with the new President of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine announcing it would investigate Joe Biden, Burisma, and 2016 election interference.  Let's discuss the facts of both.&nbsp;  White House Meeting&nbsp;  There is no question that President Trump had offered a White House meeting to President Zelensky three times: once in May on a phone call after President Zelensky won his election, once in June in a letter, and finally in the July 25th call after President Zelensky&#8217;s party won the parliamentary elections. But Tim Morrison (a State Department official called as a witness by the House) also testified that they were working on heads-of-state meetings with twelve other heads of state during that same time period. Many nations were trying to line up meetings in the White House during the summer of 2019.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, President Zelensky offered to instead move their meeting from a White House meeting to a face-to-face meeting in Warsaw, Poland, when they would both be there on September 1, 2019. The Presidents agreed, and planning began on the meeting in August. By August 22, the meeting planning was in full swing as noted by emails in the House hearing&#8217;s evidence. However, Hurricane Dorian slammed into the US in the hours leading up to the September 1 meeting, causing a last-minute shift to the Vice President traveling to Poland so the President could stay in the US to monitor hurricane relief.&nbsp;  We know that Vice President Pence met face-to-face with President Zelensky, and they spoke about other nations paying their fair share to help Ukraine and the issue of corruption across Ukraine. We know from the preparation materials and the meeting notes themselves that during the meeting the Vice President did not bring up or discuss the issue of Burisma, Joe Biden, or any other campaign conversation with President Zelensky.&nbsp;  The White House found the next available time when President Trump and President Zelensky would both be in the same place at the same time to set up a face-to-face meeting: September 25 at the UN Assembly in New York. That meeting was set up, and it took place as scheduled.&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, the House managers maintained that only a White House meeting was sufficient and that it was being withheld, but the facts show that President Zelensky himself floated the idea of a meeting in Poland and that the meeting was not barred or withheld.&nbsp;  In the early months of President Zelensky&#8217;s term, there was a great deal of concern about him, his staff, and his plans because he was an unknown political figure. Until more was known about him, it was entirely appropriate to show caution in coordinating a meeting, but once his nationwide anti-corruption efforts began in August, it was clear that face-to-face meetings were planned and carried out.&nbsp;  There was no withholding of a face-to-face meeting with President Trump and President Zelensky. There cannot be a quid pro quo if the meeting was not withheld from Ukrainian officials.&nbsp;  Foreign Aid to Ukraine  The House Managers claimed that there was a secret plot to &#8220;extort&#8221; or &#8220;bribe&#8221; the leadership of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden in exchange for around $400 million of US aid. The aid was State Department and foreign military aid that had been provided for the past four years, since Ukraine had been in a war with Russia.&nbsp;  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its occupation of Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the US started sending aid to help the Ukrainian government. Congress allowed lethal and non-lethal aid to support Ukraine, but during the previous administration, only non-lethal aid was sent. Under President Trump&#8217;s administration, it was determined that the United States would give the leadership of Ukraine lethal aid to help them fight off Russian tanks, which was President Zelensky&#8217;s reference to &#8220;javelins&#8221; in the July 25th phone call and his gratitude to President Trump for allowing those tank killing rockets to flow to Ukraine.&nbsp;  To be clear, the theory of funds being withheld from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation does not originate from the July 25 call read out. There is nothing in the text of the call that threatens the withholding of funds in exchange for an investigation.&nbsp;  The theory originates from the fact that aid was held back by the Office of Management and Budget, headed by the President&#8217;s Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and the &#8220;presumption&#8221; of US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that the aid must have been held because of the President&#8217;s desire to get the Biden investigation done, since the President&#8217;s attorney, Rudy Giuliani was working to find out more about the Biden investigation.&nbsp;  Ambassador Sondland told multiple people about his theory, but when he finally called President Trump and asked him directly about it, the President responded that he did not have any quid pro quo, he just wanted the President of Ukraine to do what he ran on and &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221; Obviously, people who assume the worst about President Trump take this as a secret message that there actually was a quid pro quo, but the most important fact is that Ambassador Sondland did not read it that way after his call with the President. Ambassador Sondland believed that the President was serious. Unfortunately, the White House Counsel was never allowed to cross examine Ambassador Sondland during the House investigation to get the facts about who he talked to and why he came to believe for a while that there was an effort to push for investigations in exchange for money.&nbsp;  During the Senate trial, I listened closely to the facts surrounding the withholding of aid money to Ukraine. This was by far the most serious charge against the President. Two key questions had to be answered for me: why was the aid held, and why was the aid released. There was no question the aid was held for a couple of months. The question was why?&nbsp;  Statements from the House witnesses during the House impeachment inquiry answered the two key questions: the aid was held because there was a legitimate concern about the new President of Ukraine and his administration in the early days of his presidency and the aid was released on time when the new Ukrainian Parliament starting passing anti-corruption laws in August and after Vice President Pence sat down face to face with President Zelensky on September 1 in Poland to discuss their progress on corruption.&nbsp;  We should not lose track of what was happening in Ukraine in 2019. A new President was elected who was a TV actor with no political experience and no record on how he would handle Russia or the issue of widespread national corruption in Ukraine. He ran on a platform of anti-corruption at all levels, but no one knew how he would govern. His campaign was funded by a Ukrainian oligarch who owned a major media outlet, and one of his first advisers was the former attorney for that oligarch.&nbsp;  I personally spoke to many of the State Department officials in Ukraine in May of 2019 and heard their concerns about the new government. Then, newly elected President Zelensky used his power to dissolve their Parliament the day he was sworn in and called for &#8220;snap elections&#8221; in which the vast majority of the newly elected leaders were from his newly formed party. To our State Department and the White House, this was either a really a good sign or a really bad sign. Either Ukraine was about to take a major change for the better with new leadership, or this new young leader was about to assume real centralized power. No one knew for certain in May, June, and July of 2019. Within a few weeks in August, the new Parliament got to work passing anti-corruption laws and making significant changes in their accountability and for the country. This was a very good sign.&nbsp;  When Vice President Pence met face to face with President Zelensky September 1, both sides had confidence the country was taking a new direction. On September 10 Vice President Pence and Senator Rob Portman met with President Trump to tell him about the progress that had been made, and both advised lifting the hold on aid. The aid was lifted the next day, September 11. No investigation into Hunter Biden or Burisma was ever done by Ukraine, and no part of the US Department of Justice was ever involved in any investigation of Hunter Biden or Burisma.&nbsp;  Though the aid was frozen in June, there was no public announcement of the hold, as explained by the White House Counsel, to keep this from becoming a public issue while the White House monitored the progress and status of the transition in Ukraine.&nbsp;  On August 27, Politico published an article that noted that the foreign aid had been held by the US. This caused President Zelensky&#8217;s office to reach out to the State Department and ask why. During the House impeachment proceedings, four of the House witnesses (Ambassador Voelker, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor, and Tim Morrison) all testified that the Ukrainian leadership learned about the temporary hold in aid after the Politico article was published.&nbsp;  The issue of the hold was also the first question from President Zelensky to Vice President Pence when they met September 1 in Poland. The idea that the leadership in Ukraine had pressure placed on them to do an investigation fails the most essential test, did the leadership of Ukraine even know that the aid was being held? The answer from multiple American and Ukrainian leaders was no, they did not know there was a hold on the aid from the White House. You cannot have pressure to act on an investigation, if they did not even know the aid was being held.&nbsp;  It is interesting to note, when I researched the records of past foreign aid payment dates and times to Ukraine, I found the 2019 aid was in line with the date the 2016, 2017, and 2018 aid was sent. The vast majority of the military aid to Ukraine was obligated in August or September for the past four years. Though the aid was ready to go out the door a couple months earlier in 2019, it was certainly not late, based on the record of the previous three years. In fact, the State Department aid was obligated September 30 in 2019, but it was obligated September 28 in 2018. As quoted by the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, &#8220;the aid was held such a short time, we did not even notice.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the two days of question-and-answer time, I asked a specific question related to this issue because I felt it was important to get the context of the aid, since there had been so much made of the issue during the trial. Here is the full text of my question to the White House Counsel:&nbsp; House Managers have described any delay in military aid and state department funds to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in September and in 2017, 73% of the funds were obligated in September. In the State Department, the funds were obligated September 30 in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 in 2018. Each year, the vast majority of the funds were obligated in the final month or days of the fiscal year. Question: Was there a national security risk to Ukraine or the United States from the funds going out late in September in the two previous years? Did it weaken our relationship with Ukraine because the vast majority of our aid was released in September each of the last three years?&nbsp;  In response to my question, White House Counsel detailed the fact that military aid from the US was not for immediate use. It was designed to help the Ukrainian military buy materials for the next year, so it was common for the aid to be obligated at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), and it was also common for some money to be left unobligated and carried over into the next fiscal year, as it was in 2019.&nbsp;  While it is easy to create an intricate story on the hold placed on foreign aid to Ukraine, it is also clear that President Trump has temporarily held foreign aid from multiple countries over the past two years, including: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Lebanon, and others. There is no question that a President can withhold aid for a short period of time, but it must be released by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, which it was in this instance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Constitutional Issues Around This Impeachment  Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants the US House of Representatives &#8220;the sole power of impeachment,&#8221; while Article I, Section 3 states that &#8220;the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.&#8221;&nbsp;  The Constitution is clear that the House does not control the Senate process and the Senate does not control the House process. However, during the impeachment trial of President Trump, the House tried repeatedly to dictate to the Senate how it should conduct its trial.&nbsp;  The &#8220;sole power to try&#8221; means laying out rules for the trial, including when and if to call additional witnesses or request more documents.&nbsp;  In addition to laying out roles and responsibilities for impeachment, our Constitution also provides basic rights for the accused. The Fifth Amendment ensures due process. However, the receipt of due process is not contingent upon waiving another right, like immunity or executive privilege. But that is exactly what the House tried to force President Trump to do.&nbsp;  The President is not above the law, but neither is the House of Representatives. If there was a question as to the scope and proper use of the President&#8217;s right to assert immunity or executive privilege regarding conversations he had with his closest advisers, that question is proper for a court to determine, not Congress, and surely not the House on its own accord. To put this in constitutional terms, the Legislative Branch cannot prevent the Executive Branch from having access to the Judicial Branch. The House wanted to move quickly and prevent the President from ever going to court to resolve any issue. That has never been done for a good reason, the separation of powers. In previous legal battles with the President, it has taken months to resolve critical issues, like Bush v. Gore in 2000 or even in the Clinton impeachment trial, when the House took two months to resolve an issue with witnesses in court. It does not have to drag on for years.&nbsp;  The House also wanted the Chief Justice of the United States to &#8220;rule on&#8221; any issue quickly, instead of allowing the President to go through the courts. This would have created a new judicial executive branch by putting all the judicial power of the nation in one person, not in the Judicial Branch, as is stated in the Constitution. It would have also ignored the text of the Constitution where it notes that the Chief Justice &#8220;presides&#8221; in the court of impeachment, not &#8220;decides.&#8221; The sole power of impeachment is in the Senate, not the Senate, plus the one Justice. The Chief Justice keeps the trial moving along, based on the rules of the trial, but he or she is not a decider of fact, that is reserved to the Senate. The House Managers wanted to ignore that part of the Constitution to move the trial faster for expedience. We cannot ignore the Constitution or create bad precedent, no matter which party is being tried for impeachment.&nbsp;  Further, the Sixth Amendment guarantees that the accused has the ability to both confront the witnesses against him and to have the assistance of counsel. The majority of the impeachment inquiry in the House was done without a meaningful opportunity for the president to participate and administration witnesses were denied the ability to have counsel present for depositions.&nbsp;  The Constitution lays out a clear separation of powers, but importantly also provides a system of checks and balances. For something as important as impeachment, it is imperative that the process be one that is squarely within the bounds of the Constitution and is one that the American people can trust. Unfortunately, the process undertaken by the House to impeach President Trump falls wildly short of the standards put in place by our Founders.&nbsp;  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that &#8220;the President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the trial of President Trump, there was a lot of conversation about what constitutes a &#8220;high crime&#8221; or &#8220;misdemeanor.&#8221; Notably, the House did not charge the President with any crimes. Rather, the House chose to impeach the President for &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; and &#8220;obstruction of Congress.&#8221;&nbsp;  The House theoretically could have chosen to file articles of impeachment for crimes such as bribery, extortion, solicitation of interference in an election, or violations of the Impoundments Clause Act. For any of these crimes, the House would have had to prove specific elements of each. Since they couldn&#8217;t prove any of those crimes, they chose to charge the President with &#8220;abuse of power.&#8221; As was noted in the trial, forty Presidents have faced accusation of &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; going back as far as George Washington.&nbsp;  The abuse of power charge for President Trump was based on allegations that he improperly withheld aid to Ukraine and conditioned a meeting with President Zelensky at the White House in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Over the course of the last four months, we heard the term quid pro quo used over and over again but the facts do not show criminal quid pro quo. As previously mentioned, President Zelensky asked to meet with President Trump in Poland and that meeting was set up. Further, while the aid to Ukraine was delayed, it wasn&#8217;t delayed more than it had been the previous two years, and the aid was released without an investigation (or even an announcement of one) into the Biden&#8217;s.&nbsp;  The second article of impeachment, Obstruction of Congress, had an even weaker constitutional foundation. The investigation was announced September 24, but did not officially begin until October 31. The impeachment vote in the House was December 18. This very short time table and the accusation that the President refused to follow the law, honor the courts and that he acted like a &#8220;King&#8221; did not meet even the most basic constitutional standards for justice.&nbsp;  For example, during the Mueller investigation, the President&#8217;s team fully cooperated with the investigation that included over 2,000 subpoenas and 500 witnesses, including the President&#8217;s Chief of Staff, multiple cabinet officials and many lower-level officials that were all made available. It was clear throughout the investigation that the President did not like or agree with the Mueller investigation, but he also fully cooperated with every subpoena, each witness and every document. In fact, they released over a million pages of documents to the Mueller team.&nbsp;  President Trump also made his disagreement with the courts very clear on issues like the census, whether travel restrictions can be put in place to ensure national security, or whether particular funds can be used to secure our southern border. But, each time the President lost in court, his Administration complied with orders from the Judiciary. That is how our system of government is supposed to work.&nbsp;  When disagreements happen between the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch, they usually lead to resolution, not impeachment. The Fast and Furious investigation, which lasted more than three years in the Obama Administration, led to a vote in the House to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, but it never led to an impeachment inquiry, even though there was a clear and consistent refusal to cooperate with Congress or turn over key documents for three years.&nbsp;  In this case the accusation that President Trump ignored subpoenas or refused to follow the law is not correct. The President&#8217;s team made it very clear that they would cooperate during the impeachment inquiry with properly authorized and issued subpoenas, but the House refused to issue subpoenas that were consistent with the law to seek resolution for documents and witnesses. The House was focused on speed, not legal process.&nbsp;  The House, in a rush to impeachment last fall, issued multiple subpoenas for documents and testimony before the House had given authority to the committees to issue subpoenas for an impeachment inquiry, which happened October 31. Since there was no authority to issue the subpoenas, they were not duly authorized. The House also demanded testimony from the President&#8217;s inner circle without working through the legal questions and the House demanded Executive Agency witnesses appear without allowing them to bring Agency counsel with them. All of those issues created very real legal and constitutional problems. Agency individuals have always been allowed to have legal counsel with them when they are deposed, except this time.&nbsp;  As a Member of Congress, I cannot demand the President turn over documents or give testimony in any fashion that I would prefer, just because I have oversight responsibilities. In the same way, the President or other Executive Branch officials cannot demand I turn over my notes or provide my staff for testimony without going through the courts and gaining a legal subpoena. Congress has vigorously and rightfully protected its rights from unwarranted investigations from any president. And presidents have done the same. But in all cases, the law must be followed and the proper process must be pursued to get the information in a legal way.&nbsp;  Additional Witnesses  From the very first moments of the Senate trial, the House Managers fought for additional witnesses and documents from the President. Their argument, and justification for the second article of impeachment, centered on the White House&#8217;s refusal to turn over documents and make every witness available without going through the normal legal process.&nbsp;  Per the resolution adopted by the Senate, the House record was part of the trial record. The Senate had the testimony of the witnesses the House chose to question as part of the overall information of the trial. The House already had 28,000 pages of documents that were part of the evidence they submitted to the Senate. Although, the House Managers admitted during the Senate impeachment trial that they still have not released all of the documents and witness testimony that they had gathered in their investigation to the White House Counsel or to the Senate. We do not fully know why the House held back some of its witness testimony and released others.&nbsp;  The House witness testimony was used extensively in the Senate trial.  Witnesses who testified live or via video in the House and Senate Impeachment:&nbsp;  David Holmes, Political Counselor, US Embassy Ukraine, State Department&nbsp; Dr. Fiona Hill, White House Adviser, National Security Council David Hale, Undersecretary for Political Affairs, State Department&nbsp; Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense&nbsp; Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union&nbsp; Tim Morison, Former White House Advisor&nbsp; Kurt Voelker, Former Special Envoy for Ukraine&nbsp; Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, National Security Council&nbsp; Jennifer Williams, Aide to the Vice President&nbsp; Marie Yovanovitch, Former Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp; George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State&nbsp; Bill Taylor, Former United States Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp;  The House Managers repeated over and over that additional witnesses would only take a week to depose, which is a clearly false statement. New witnesses took longer than a week to depose in the House inquiry, clearly it would take just as long or longer in a Senate trial. The remaining &#8220;wish list&#8221; of witnesses all had clear issues that needed to be resolved in the courts, which would take a couple of months to resolve, which is why the House Managers did not push for their testimony in the House impeachment process, they valued speed more than legal process.&nbsp;  House Managers repeatedly stated that witnesses only took a week to depose in the Clinton Senate impeachment trial, but they know that during the Clinton Senate trial all three called witnesses previously deposed in the House inquiry or in the Grand Jury investigation and all issues of Executive privilege had already been decided through the courts. There were no new witnesses in the Senate trial of President Clinton. Also, the Clinton White House had already had the opportunity to cross examine witnesses or the investigators in the Clinton impeachment inquiry; this time the Trump White House had been denied that right. So, if new witnesses would be added for the Senate trial, the White House should have the right to also cross examine the previous House witnesses that they had been denied the right to cross examine in the past. This would all take much longer than a week and the House Managers knew that.&nbsp;  During the Clinton Impeachment trial in the Senate, there were no additional documents requested, only previously deposed witnesses. The House Managers did not go through the legal process to get documents, like the Mueller investigation had done, so all of the new document requests from the House Managers would take at least three to five weeks to complete, once a legal subpoena is delivered. It takes time to search all databases, review the documents for classified materials, determine any legal issues, and release them to the investigation. Once the documents are turned over, both legal teams need time to review the documents. Again, the House Managers knew these facts, but they continued to repeat over and over that it would only take a week to get all the documents.&nbsp;  The first question for the Senate trial was: do we have enough evidence and testimony to answer the questions the House presented in their articles of impeachment? If the answer is yes, then we do not need additional witnesses or documents. If the answer is no, then we do need additional information. There were many leaks and newspaper stories during the trial designed to push the Senate to vote to ask for more testimony, but that did not change the primary question. We already knew from evidence that there was no quid pro quo, no Ukrainian investigations and no withholding of a public meeting with President Trump.&nbsp;  The New York Times story on January 26 and again on January 31 are clear examples of an attempt to bring doubt on the information and witness testimony. Both stories stated that someone had read the pending John Bolton book manuscript and that in the book Bolton stated that President Trump had talked about investigations in exchange for aid funding for Ukraine. The New York Times also wrote that the book would state that Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, were also a part of the scheme. I looked at both stories closely and noticed that the reporters had not read the manuscripts or quoted the manuscripts; they were reports from someone who stated that they had read the manuscripts. Both stories took significant liberties to describe the intent in the manuscripts, but the reporter had apparently also not spoken to John Bolton.&nbsp;  On January 23, 2020, the National Security Council lawyers sent a letter to the legal team handling the book publishing for John Bolton to inform him that the manuscript contained some classified information and it would need have some edits before publication in March. Then, on January 26, the New York Times published a story that someone had leaked some of the details of the book, but they had not released the actual manuscript. While I am interested in seeing the actual manuscript, I am also very aware that this selective leak was designed by The&nbsp;New York Times and whoever leaked the information to influence the ongoing trial.&nbsp;  It was clear from the earliest days of the trial that the House had a clear political strategy as well as a court-room strategy. During the trial I had the responsibility to hear the facts but also to separate the politics from the facts. Politically, it was best for the House to move as quickly as possible through impeachment so that vulnerable Democratic members could vote for impeachment, and then move quickly to other topics. But since the presidential election is in full swing, it was politically better for Democrats to make the Senate trial move as slow as possible to hurt the President during the campaign. That explains why the House did not take the time to formally request documents or testimony from many individuals; they needed to move fast and try to force the Senate to move slowly. It also explained why the House passed impeachment on a party line vote, then held the articles of impeachment for a month before delivering them to the Senate to start the trial. The House Managers said repeatedly that the evidence was clear and that they had proved their case. But, if that was true, why would the Senate need to call additional witnesses? I think the reason is that the witness process was about delay, more than facts.&nbsp;  Final Thoughts  The facts do not support the accusation in the Trump impeachment, and it certainly did not need to come to this moment of national division. While, it was clear that the House Managers wanted to drag the trial on for months in the Senate, through the primary election season, their case consisted of hypothetical story lines and &#8220;presumptions&#8221; more than facts that warrant the removal of a President. This does not meet what Alexander Hamilton in Federalist, No. 65 described as the &#8220;due weight&#8221; for the arguments.&nbsp;  But impeachment has certainly created the division in our society that Alexander Hamilton predicted. Over 200 years ago he wrote, &#8220;The prosecution [of impeachments], will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.&#8221; This has been an incredibly divisive season in our nation. It is not about one person, it is about all of us. We individually choose how we handle disagreements with family, friends, and people on the other side of particular issues. Our government represents us, so it is up to us to model for our government how to handle disagreements.&nbsp;  We are now past impeachment, and it's time to work on the issues that matter most to the American people. As we move forward, every American should speak out on the issues that are important to them and the voices that speak for their point of view. But, we should remember that we have much more in common than we have that divides us. It is my hope that our nation does not go through a season like this again for a very long time and that we can move past this age of impeachment to an age of oversight and accountability.&nbsp;  I appreciate all the engagement with our office during the impeachment proceedings. We had thousands of calls and emails over the past month. We had hundreds of thousands of views on the nightly Facebook Live updates each day during the trial. While not every Oklahoman agrees with every decision I make on behalf of our state, I am grateful most choose to be respectful in expressing their points of view. At the end of the day, we are Oklahomans. We may not all agree on each issue, but we can be respectful of each other in our disagreement.&nbsp;  I am honored to serve our state and nation.

As you start your week, I'd like to share some updates about what I've been working on.  Recently, I had the privilege of naming Varun Srivastava, a student at Redlands High School, as the winner of the Congressional App Challenge for our district. Varun designed an app called \"We Will\" which will help users monitor their carbon footprints and fight climate change in their everyday lives.&nbsp;        Congressional App Challenge Winner&nbsp;Varun Srivastava.    As you know, President Trump delivered his annual State of the Union address last week. I was proud to be joined by San Bernardino County Fire Chief Dan Munsey, whose presence served as a reminder of the importance of a strong working relationship between the federal government and our local agencies.&nbsp;        San Bernardino County Fire Chief Daniel Munsey    Unfortunately, the president's speech was full of the same divisive rhetoric and falsehoods we've come to expect from one of his rallies. You can read my full reaction to the State of the Union here.   One of the most important parts of my week was hosting a workshop for non-profits in our community to learn more about the 2020 Census. From the quality our children's schools, to the&nbsp; safety of the roads we drive on, the results of this year's census will have an enormous effect on our daily lives in the Inland Empire. I hope that you'll help me spread the word throughout our community to make sure every San Bernardino County resident is counted.        Watch Rep. Aguilar's 2020 Census Announcement&nbsp;      As always, it's my privilege to serve as your representative in Washington.&nbsp;  Thanks, Pete AguilarMember of Congress     &nbsp;                             &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;                         Washington, DC Office 109 CannonHouse Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-3201Fax: (202) 226-6962 San Bernardino Office 685 E.

Hearing your thoughts and concerns are invaluable to me, and I appreciate each of you for voicing your opinions on the issues that impact you and your neighbors. I will bring your ideas back with me to Washington.&nbsp;    I enjoyed talking with WLXA's Ben Luna and Charlotte Stremler during my visit to Loretto. We discussed the latest happenings in Washington and my visit to the Southern border.&nbsp;    I always enjoy seeing my former colleagues in the Tennessee State Senate. Thank you for welcoming me back for the opening prayer.&nbsp;    It was an honor keynoting Lawrenceburg's annual Rotary Club luncheon. Thank you for having me!&nbsp;   Border Visit:&nbsp;  While in El Paso, I toured operations centers at Fort Bliss and sections of the border alongside Fort Campbell's own 3rd Brigade Combat Team. These brave men and women are doing tremendous work to secure our border, and I appreciate the opportunity to witness their efforts firsthand.&nbsp;    Our soldiers are working seamlessly with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol to keep the homeland secure, and they will remain in Tennessee's prayers back home.&nbsp;     D.C. Update:   On Tuesday evening, we saw the President lay out his optimistic vision for America. Since this President's election, 152,000 jobs have been created in Tennessee. Of those, 15,000 are manufacturing jobs. This great American comeback has been a great Tennessean comeback too, and I am proud to stand with President Trump as he leads America with pro-growth policies.&nbsp; I proudly co-sponsored H. Res. 832 condemning Speaker Pelosi's disgraceful actions on the floor of the House during the State of the Union. Speaker Pelosi's conduct was disrespectful to all the American heroes honored that night.&nbsp; Rural ER Access Act:&nbsp;  Last week, I introduced the Rural ER Access Act. My bill would repeal the 35-mile rule to permit free-standing emergency departments to operate in the rural communities that need them the most.&nbsp;Over the past decade, more than twelve hospitals in Tennessee have been forced to close their doors. As an emergency medicine physician, I believe we must ensure rural Americans are never left without access to emergency care because of unnecessary bureaucratic regulations.&nbsp;  In the News:&nbsp;  I joined Tony Perkins' show Washington Watch to discuss the latest on religious freedom and the President's acquittal.&nbsp;  Last week, I joined Fox Business' Charles Payne to discuss the failure of Democrat impeachment managers during the trial.&nbsp;  Fox Business' Trish Regan and I discussed what the medical community currently knows about the coronavirus and the latest from President Trump's stellar defense team.&nbsp;  Watch my latest Whiteboard Wednesday.&nbsp;  Impeachment Update:  The impeachment hoax is over! 135 wasted days, 33 of which Speaker Pelosi sat on the articles saying it was \"urgent.\" America has never been safer, stronger, and more prosperous than now under President Trump's leadership. This was a fair and just acquittal.&nbsp;  As always, feel free to contact my office with your questions and concerns. Your thoughts are valuable to me as I represent the people of the 7th District in Congress.&nbsp;  Sincerely,&nbsp;   Member of Congress                  Washington, DC Office533 Cannon HOBWashington, DC 20515  202-225-2811    Clarksville Office128 N.

The Pro Act will work to create an economy that rewards hard-working Americans in several key ways: &#8226; Protecting the basic right to join a union&#8226; Introducing meaningful, enforceable penalties for companies that violate workers&#8217; rights&#8226; Expanding workers&#8217; collective bargaining rights and closing loopholes that corporations use to exploit workers&#8226; Strengthening workers&#8217; access to fair union elections and requiring corporations to respect the results&nbsp;    Here&#8217;s what else I&#8217;ve been up to:  &nbsp;   Shedding Light on Puerto Rico Earthquakes         It was an honor to welcome Jessica Carrillo&nbsp;to the Capitol as my guest to the State of the Union. She fled Gu&#225;nica to our district as a result of Puerto Rico&#8217;s devastating earthquakes. While President failed to mention Puerto Rico in his address, her message was still clear: it&#8217;s time President Trump end his personal vendetta against Puerto Rico and work with House Democrats to help the island rebuild.  Helping Puerto Rico Recover and Rebuild         In recent weeks, thousands of families in Puerto Rico were forced from their homes, schools were flattened and roads and infrastructure were severely damaged as earthquakes rocked an island still struggling to recover from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Today, Democrats and Republicans came together to deliver on our promise to help our fellow Americans get on a road to long-term recovery. The House passed an emergency supplemental that provides $4.89 billion in emergency spending&nbsp;for a broad range of disaster recovery activities, including educational needs, repairs to transportation infrastructure, community development, energy needs and nutrition assistance.   Fighting for a Venezuela Libre         I had the privilege of meeting the legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaido. My colleagues and I will continue to support his leadership and brave people of Venezuela. Together, we will do everything we can to fight for a Venezuela Libre!   Honoring Gun Violence Survivors         Gun Violence Survivors&nbsp;Week is a time we say enough is enough and honor survivors by doing everything we can to make sure senseless tragedies, like the #Pulse nightclub shooting, never happen again. In doing so, we also recognize the brave heroes, like Terry DeCarlo, who do everything they can help survivors recover.   Standing with my Brothers and Sisters in Labor    It was an honor to meet with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)&nbsp;to tell them about our historic Protecting the Right to Organize Act!     Honoring a Purple Heart Veteran           Mr. James W. Scroggins, a Korean War Veteran, is an American hero. During his time in service, he fought in Pusan, Korea &amp; was wounded in battle. It was an honor to present him with a Purple Heart for his great heroism &amp; lifelong dedication to our country.  Working with Local Mayors         I had a great meeting with Polk County Mayors this week to discuss rebuilding America with our Moving Forward framework, expanding high speed rail, improving postal service, ensuring everyone is counted in the upcoming census and expanding SunRail and high speed rail. Looking forward to continuing our work for our constituents!  Meeting with Hispanic Leaders         I was proud to have had the chance to sit down with a number of community leaders this week to discuss the tragedy of the Puerto Rico earthquakes and the work we&#8217;ve been doing in Congress to secure a relief package and temporary housing&nbsp;assistance under FEMA for victims. We also discussed the 2020 Census, cruel Public Charge court ruling and our work for a free Venezuela.&nbsp;     Moving Forward with our Nation&#8217;s Infrastructure         The Trump Administration will try to convince you that the Moving Forward framework cannot be achieved. My response at the Environment &amp; Climate Change Subcommittee: yes we can and here is the proof that it can.   Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

On Tuesday, the President delivered the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. I was disappointed that President Trump used a moment that should be an opportunity to unite the country behind a robust vision for the future to instead deliver a divisive campaign-style speech. The following day, the Senate failed to get the necessary 2/3 majority to convict President Trump, despite the clear evidence that President Trump compromised our national security for his own political personal gain and solicited foreign interference in our election. It is deeply troubling to me that a majority of Senators refused to allow a full and fair trial by blocking admission witness and documents into the Senate proceedings. I remain profoundly worried that this trial will set a precedent for future Presidents.  Nevertheless, regardless of your views, the important thing now is that we move forward as a country. Throughout the impeachment process, the House has continued working on behalf of the American people. Last year the House passed more than 400 bills, including 275 with bipartisan support.&nbsp; That pace continues into 2020 and just last week we passed legislation to reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is critical to our local environment, as well as the PRO Act which strengthens workers&#8217; right to organize. This week, we are expected to address legislation related to public lands and the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as hold a hearing on surprise medical billing in the Ways and Means Committee.  At home over the weekend, we had a full house at our most recent Congress on Your Corner town hall in Winthrop Harbor. I was also grateful for everyone who turned in Valentines to our office for local veterans &#8211; it was a privilege to distribute them over the weekend at a Lake County Honor Flight event and at Lovell Federal Health Care Center.  &nbsp;  HOLDING THE NRA ACCOUNTABLE  I am continuing to work to hold the NRA accountable for its potentially illegal abuse of our tax-exempt system, taking advantage of not just American taxpayers, but also misappropriating donations from NRA members. Last week, I released a report detailing detailing a pattern of misdeeds, including an egregious spending by NRA leaders, extensive self-dealing and conflicts of interest, and pervasive efforts to evade transparency. I am again calling on the IRS to investigate these potential improprieties on behalf of the thousands of law-abiding non-profit organizations and hardworking taxpayers.    &nbsp;  INVITING VIETNAM VETERANS TO COMMEMORATION CEREMONY IN LAKE FOREST    I am honored to host another opportunity in Lake Forest&nbsp;on Saturday, February 29, 2020&nbsp;to&nbsp;recognize the veterans of the Vietnam War as part of the congressionally authorized &#8220;United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration.&#8221;  At the event, official Vietnam War 50th Commemoration lapel pins, official certificates, and proclamations will be distributed to veterans. Attendees must RSVP using the below form and submit a DD214 to demonstrate eligibility. If you do not have a DD214 copy, our office can help you obtain one. The commemoration items may be presented to veterans posthumously if the family completes an application on their loved one&#8217;s behalf.  RSVP with the form on our website.  I hope you will join us.  &nbsp;  INVITING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO 2020 MODEL CONGRESS!    One of my favorite programs is our Model Congress for high school students.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thrilled to again host this year&#8217;s Model Congress on March 15 at Adlai E. Stevenson High School.&nbsp; The Model Congress is a hands-on &nbsp;opportunity for Tenth District high students to simulate the work of a Member of Congress. Students will hear expert testimony, debate amendments in committee and vote on legislation. I&#8217;ll be participating as well, presiding as Speaker.  This year&#8217;s Model Congress will be held on Sunday, March 15, 2020 from 9:00am - 3:00pm at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire.  Tenth District High Schools may select up to ten students to participate. Please have all nominated students submit the application form to our office. The deadline for registration is February 14th.    &nbsp;  CENSUS 2020 UPDATE    It's so important that everyone in our communities is counted as part of the 2020 Census. To that end, learn more about how the Census is fighting the spread of false misinformation that could depress participation.&nbsp;  Learn more about putting 2020 Census rumors to rest  &nbsp;  NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS  Our constituent service representatives hold  in communities across the Tenth District to more easily meet with constituents about any casework needs. My team will be in Lake Bluff and Waukegan this week. If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!  &nbsp;  WEEKLY WRAP-UP   We had another wonderful #CongressonYourCorner town hall on Saturday in Winthrop Harbor.&nbsp; It was a standing room only gathering, and the wide-ranging conversation touched on high drug prices, protecting the Great Lakes, local flooding, bipartisanship, and more. I want to extend a special thank you to Scout Troop 667 for presenting the colors and leading the pledge of allegiance.  &nbsp;    Our annual &#8220;Valentines for Vets&#8221; campaign collected more than 1,200 cards from constituents and area schools (a new record)! I had the great honor to personal distribute some of these beautiful cards over the weekend at the Lake County Honor Flight breakfast and at a bingo game Lovell Federal Health Care Center. Special thanks to the 4-H Club for helping make the afternoon at Lovell so nice.&nbsp; And thank you to everyone who participated to share our gratitude with and brighten the day of so many local veterans.  &nbsp;    Last Thursday, I was honored to welcome Pastor Wade Stevenson to Washington last week as my guest to the National Prayer Breakfast in recognition of the important work done by Gideon Missionary Baptist Church in the Waukegan community. I would encourage you to  who shared an important and timely message about overcoming our political polarization and replacing contempt with love.  &nbsp;   It was great to meet last week with UAW Region 4. They were visiting to talk about the PRO Act because our nation&#8217;s workers deserve a voice at the negotiating table. This legislation strengthens workers&#8217; power to stand together and negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, and safer conditions. The bill passed in the House on Thursday.  &nbsp;    As we discussed in last week&#8217;s newsletter, I was very excited to welcome North Chicago Community High School's Dr. David Brothman as my guest to the State of the Union address. We are certainly in the midst of historic times, and our public school teachers like David have the responsibility to educate and inspire our next generation of engaged citizens. This picture was taken in my office just before heading to the House chamber.  &nbsp;            During Gun Violence Survivor Week, we remember the survivors of this horrible epidemic. I spoke on the floor about why it&#8217;s time for Leader McConnell to do right by the countless survivors of gun violence and bring a vote on universal background checks (HR 8).  &nbsp;    Finally, I shared an update on my fight to restore the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction at the legislative breakfast of the Lake County Municipal League.&nbsp; It was a great turnout for early on a Saturday morning.&nbsp; I was especially pleased and impressed by the emphasis on unity and working together to make our local communities stronger today and in the future.

Our country is stronger today than it has been in years - our economy, our military, our families, our environment, and our communities are stronger. This is thanks in large part to three years of an administration that has made it a point to get government off the backs of hardworking Americans and put America first. Americans across the county are experiencing a \"blue-collar boom.\" We have historically low unemployment, and more Americans are working today than ever before. Industries like construction, healthcare are adding jobs at a robust pace.   Labor participation and wages are rising, especially for the bottom 10 percent of earners. More than 2.5 million Americans have risen out of poverty. In Florida, 630,000 more jobs have been created. Florida homeownership is up 3 percentage points. Real, per-capita income is up 7 percent since the President&#8217;s election.  From appointing judges who know and respect the U.S. Constitution; to improving the VA and veteran services; to reducing tax burdens on small business owners and taxpayers; to streamlining and removing unnecessary red-tape that blocked infrastructure investments; to improving our trade agreements for American workers, manufacturers and builders; securing our borders; to and rebuilding our military &#8211; President Trump has kept his promises. The President also spoke of the bipartisan success that has been achieved in Washington when Democrats quit playing politics and come to the negotiating table. Under President Trump's administration, including USMCA and a phase One trade deal with China. Another bipartisan achievement is the \"First Step Act,\" which allows inmates serving for drug-related crimes to receive a second chance. I hope my colleagues &#8211; Democrat and Republican alike &#8211; will put aside politics and work together to invest in our country&#8217;s infrastructure, improve border security and reduce and prioritize spending. President Trump&#8217;s address also included compelling stories of Americans coming from all walks of life. These guests&#8217; lives illustrate his inspiring message that \"Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!\"            (Video of Guests)  _______________  On Friday, the Department of Labor released the January jobs report. Employers added 225,000 jobs in the first month of 2020. &nbsp;Perhaps more importantly, wages have increased 3.1% from last year.&nbsp; This report smashes expectations and continues to show that policies reducing regulations and lowering taxes is getting people across the country back into the workforce. The U.S. economy is positioned to fuel more economic growth this year.            ______________ President Trump's message to terrorists has been clear, \"You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life.\" On Thursday, our military conducted a counterterrorism operation in Yemen that successfully killed Qasim al-Rimi, founder and leader of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and deputy to al-Qa'ida top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. al-Rimi joined the terrorist group in the 1990s and worked for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Under al-Rimi, AQAP committed countless attacks against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire attacks against the United States. His death damages AQAP and the al-Qa'ida regime and brings the U.S. closer to eliminating the threats these terror groups pose to our national security.  _______________  Each year, the U.S. Congress hosts the Congressional Art Competition. This unique competition allows me to showcase the artistic talents of high school students within the 11th&nbsp;District. &nbsp;The winning entries from each district are prominently displayed in the Cannon Tunnel to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. The competition is open to high school students only, including home educated students. Each student may enter one piece of artwork that illustrates this year&#8217;s theme, the \"Wonders of Florida.\" &nbsp;For guidelines, deadlines and more specific information, please visit my website.    (2019 Congressional Art Competition Winner)  _______________  Cindy Brown from my local office recently attended The Villages Giving Clubs Showcase. The purpose of this event is to showcase the many clubs, organizations, and groups that work to give back to our community, our region, and the world at large. At least 36 clubs participated. One of the clubs was Angel Snugs from the Villages. Jen Smith and Bonnie Mulneix - leaders of The Villages Angel Snugs club, showcased their mission to teach volunteers to knit, crochet and loom hats. These items are then shipped to 80 pediatric hospitals around the country to help comfort children that have lost their hair due to chemotherapy cancer treatments.&nbsp;    _______________  Last week, my District Director Christa Pearson participated in the First Annual Hernando Grown Student Conference. She spoke to Hernando County high school students about their next steps in achieving their educational and career goals after high school. Thank you and congratulations to all involved in a great inaugural event!     Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress  &nbsp; Constituent Corner A member of the Florida Army National Guard stated that he never received the reenlistment signing bonus he had agreed to when renewing his contract in February 2019.&nbsp; Our office inquired into the situation and learned that a recent backlog had been cleared and that the payment was scheduled to be applied to his retirement fund.  Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.&nbsp;  District Update Pam Jones from my local office attended the American Heart Association &#8220;Wear Red for Heart Health&#8221; along with UF Health Leesburg Hospital. &#8220;Wear Red for Heart Health&#8221; is the American Heart Association&#8217;s yearly campaign to raise awareness for women to act against their number 1 killer &#8211; heart disease. Dr. Michelle Wood, who is an obstetrician&#8211;gynecologist in Leesburg was the guest speaker and shared tips on heart health for women.    Legislative Update Last week the House passed H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness Act. This bill repeals a mandate from the 2006 passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which required the USPS to fully pre-fund future retiree health care benefits. This requirement is unique to the USPS and has financially crippled the postal service.&nbsp; By removing this mandate, the USPS has the flexibility to use revenues to improve services and compete while still funding retirement benefits in a sustainable manner. I am a strong supporter of the USPS and a co-sponsor of this bill. This legislation now moves onto the U.S. Senate for consideration.    &nbsp; Results of  which asked... \"Do you plan on watching President Trump&#8217;s State of the Union Address on Tuesday, February 4th?\"&nbsp;  Yes - 81%  No - 15%  Unsure - 4%        &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington1210 LongworthWashington, DC 20515202-225-1002 Leesburg318 South 2nd St #ALeesburg, FL 34748352-241-9220 Inverness212 W.

Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Concluding the Senate Impeachment Trial On Wednesday, the Senate Impeachment Trial concluded after votes on both Articles of Impeachment. Both articles failed to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove a President from office, with 48-52 and 47-53 votes respectively. When I took the oath at the beginning of this trial, I vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law. I took this oath and responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until I heard arguments from both the House managers and President Trumps lawyers. After hearing from both sides and asking multiple questions  , I voted no on conviction and removal of the president. I came to this conclusion after three major considerations. First, in order to avoid a system of government where the president serves at the political pleasure of Congress, the Framers intended impeachment and removal to be reserved for extreme and rare situations. The alleged facts contained in the articles and presented by the impeachment managers do not rise to this level. Second, the House failed in its prosecutorial role by not presenting specific statutory charges against the president. Our Constitution demands of the justice system that prosecutors bring specific charges and prove each element of those charges beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, neither of the articles passed by the House contain statutory allegations to which the Senate could determine whether the elements for conviction were met. On the floor, the House managers argued that the statutory crime of bribery was contained in the first Article of Impeachment related to abuse of power. In addition to the fact that there is no evidence in the record that satisfies the statutory elements of bribery, the Senate cannot substitute its own charges or charges made by House managers on the floor for those contained within the House-passed Articles of Impeachment. Third, the House failed to meet its evidentiary burden and attempted to shift that burden to the Senate. Unwilling to give the judicial system the time to answer important questions of executive privilege in regards to specific witnesses that the House managers claimed were key to the case, the House moved forward with impeachment. The House managers argued at the beginning of the trial that they had overwhelming evidence supporting impeachment. It was surprising then that the House managers attempted to burden the Senate with issuing subpoenas and taking testimony from those witnesses that the House failed to pursue. Regardless, additional evidence or witnesses would not change the material underlying facts describing the presidents actions. These actions are not high crimes and misdemeanors as described by the Constitution, and therefore, I voted no  on conviction and removal of the president.  Supporting the Presidents State of the Union Priorities On Tuesday evening, President Trump delivered the State of the Union  , offering Congress and the American people the opportunity to hear directly from the President of the United States regarding his vision for Americas future. I was pleased the president discussed trade, our economy, STEM education, and support for our military and veterans. President Trump highlighted accomplishments have hopefully made on establishing fairer trade with China and signing the historic United States Mexico-Canada Agreement. New trade opportunities will help provide Kansas farmers and manufacturers with markets to sell their products around the world. As Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with President Trump to pass and implement policies that prioritize veterans and ensure they receive the care they deserve. I was honored to bring veteran and Kansas Representative Chris Croft to the State of the Union as my guest, and I appreciate the president hosting a number of veterans to the State of the Union as his guests to honor their service and the success they have achieved after service. President Trump also conveyed his wish for Congress to fully fund NASAs Artemis program. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science. I am committed to ensuring NASA has the necessary resources for our country to once again put Americans on the moon, furthering our national security and scientific priorities. I look forward to working with President Trump and the administration on the many issues discussed to deliver positive results for Kansans and all Americans.  Hosting Kansas Representative Chris Croft I invited  Kansas Representative Chris Croft, who represents the 8th district in Overland Park to the U.S. Capitol as my guest at the State of the Union. He is both a veteran and an advocate for veterans in his role as a Kansas representative. He served in the U.S. Army for 30 years and after retiring as a Colonel was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. Rep. Croft is dedicated to his country, to Kansas and to our nations veterans, and I was honored to have him join me at the State of the Union as my guest. During his time in the Army, Rep. Croft served in Iraq and was selected as the executive director for the Center for Army Leadership at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In that role, he helped create the Armys first leader development manual and assisted U.S. allies around the world to establish their own leadership centers. He received the distinction as the longest-serving director of the Armys Leadership Center. After retiring from the Army, Rep. Croft continued his service by running for the Kansas House of Representatives. He was elected as the representative for the 8th district in 2018 and was selected to serve on the Veteran and Military Affairs Committee. Croft is working to pass legislation to help establish a new home for veterans in northeast Kansas. Thank you to Rep. Croft for joining me.  Chairing a Hearing on the VA Community Care Network On Wednesday, I convened my first hearing  as Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. The focus was providing oversight to the VAs efforts to implement the Community Care Network (CCN), a component of the VA MISSION Act. This legislation directed the VA to create a network of community providers as an alternative for veterans when the VA is unable to provide timely or quality care. While we are still in the early stages of network deployment, the committee took the opportunity to have a discussion about the CCN with the VA, the companies responsible for building this network and other stakeholders. I shared my concerns regarding network adequacy and pushed the VA to use uniform access standards throughout the CCN, which will make it easier for veterans to receive community care. The CCN will go live in Kansas next month and a robust network will be vital to guarantee our rural veterans receive timely healthcare. In my opening statement, I noted how Kansas Big First Congressional District is as large as the State of Illinois, but lacks a VA Medical Center. For veterans in rural areas, MISSIONs Community Care Network is essential for timely healthcare. As Chairman, I will continue to hold oversight hearings to make certain veterans are receiving the care and benefits they deserve.  Discussing Solutions to World Hunger and Development Issues I was pleased to join World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley and United States Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) leadership on Tuesday for a discussion about solutions to global hunger and development issues. As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus and member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture and State and Foreign Operations, hunger and development issues are some of my top priorities in the Senate. International food aid and development programs provide many benefits to Americans, including preventing violence and unrest overseas and markets for the commodities produced by Kansas farmers and ranchers. This discussion focused on solutions to these important problems, including what Congress should be focusing on in the future. I look forward to continuing to work with my Senate colleagues on alleviating these global issues. Pictured below is President and CEO of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition Liz Schrayer, Executive Directory Beasley and Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.).  Speaking at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting On Tuesday, I was honored to speak at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. I spoke about trade and the challenges that farmers and ranchers have faced in Kansas and around the country. Due to disrupted trade markets, weather disasters, and low commodity prices, net farm income is down by 50 percent since 2013. The work of ag lenders is very important for farmers and ranchers in rural communities to have access to credit, in good times and bad. I would like to thank Jeff Shipp for giving me the opportunity to speak at their meeting.  Reacting to the CBOs Budget & Economic Outlook Report This week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030 Report  . The report details projections on the rising levels of federal deficits, debts and spending in the decade to come. The CBOs projections make clear the unsustainable fiscal path that the country finds itself on. Their analysis highlights the rapid expansion of mandatory spending programs in our government, projecting that these programs will account for 65 percent of total government spending by the end of the decade. With the growth of mandatory spending programs outpacing the growth of revenue, Congress has the responsibility to produce a plan that ensures future generations do not bear the burdens of harmful spending. As a member of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, & Science, I will work to ensure that the spending bills are fiscally responsible and do not threaten the economic growth and opportunity of our children and grandchildren.

Gary&#8217;s son, Brett, was killed while off duty in October attempting to provide aid after a car struck a utility pole. Brett was a true hero &#8211; he was a dedicated firefighter and a U.S. Army veteran. I paid tribute to Brett&#8217;s lifetime of service on the House floor following his passing, and it was a true honor to have Gary with me on Tuesday. Olmsted Township Police Officer Gary Wilson was born and raised in Northeast Ohio and currently lives in Olmsted Falls. Gary became a sworn police officer in 2003, and after starting off as a dispatcher and watching the officers perform their duty, he fell in love with the profession and became full-time in 2012. Gary was one of two police officers honored by the township last year for rescuing a disoriented man who wandered away from home during a snowstorm and collapsed in a wooded area. In memory of his fallen son, Gary intends to create a scholarship to help others attend the fire academy who otherwise would not be able to afford it. Thank you, Gary, for all you do for our community! It was a true privilege to spend the evening with you.    Great Lakes Restoration Initiative of 2019 passed the HouseThis week we saw the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019 pass the U.S. House of Representatives. I was proud to support this bill alongside my Northeast Ohio colleague Congressman Dave Joyce. The Great Lakes are an essential natural resource, not only for our district and state, but for the entire country. One of the world&#8217;s largest bodies of fresh water, the Great Lakes provide fresh drinking water for over 30 million people. In addition, the Great Lakes serve as an economic engine &#8211; generating $8.4 billion in wages and supporting over 300,000 jobs. But the Great Lakes are more than a source of revenue. They are an essential part of what makes Northeast Ohio such a great place to live, work, and raise a family. Learn more about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative by watching my speech in support of the bill on the House floor below:  WATCH THE VIDEO HERE  Thank-a-Vet Thursday: Remembering Summit County World War II Veteran Glenn SmithLast week I gave a speech on the House floor honoring the life of Summit County World War II veteran Glenn Smith, who passed away last month. For this month&#8217;s Thank-a-Vet Thursday, I wanted to continue honoring Glenn&#8217;s memory by releasing an excerpt of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project Interview Glenn completed with my staff earlier this year. Glenn was a Navy Seabee and served from our country from August 1943 to July 1945. He Glenn was drafted into the Navy at age 19 and shipping out alongside 7,600 other men to Honolulu on Christmas Eve 1943 to help rebuild the barracks there. Glenn went on to serve in the pacific theater and at the end of the war was flown from Saipan to Pearl Harbor where he took the USS Constellation home. When Glenn returned to Akron, he did odd jobs until spending time in real estate, construction and rental properties.

I am proud of these results, particularly as it relates to our thriving economy and how it is working to the benefit all Americans. I was disheartened by the behavior of some of my colleagues, which I found to be a stain on the rich history of our institution and a poor example for our children. What unites us as Americans is greater than our division and we must work together in a civil manner to find common ground.  Additionally, last week the Senate finally brought to a close a partisan, politically-motivated charade. There are many important issues facing our country, and the time for putting this distraction behind us is long overdue. I will continue to work with my colleagues to build consensus on the issues that matter most to our community and that will improve the lives of those I serve.  Strengthening our Economy  Last week&#8217;s State of the Union address highlighted our great economic success story.&nbsp; Here are just a few examples in Florida.  The most recent Jobs Report contains more good news about the strength of the American economy. More than 225,000 jobs were added in January and the jobless rate was 3.6%. Additionally, wages are up 3.1% when compared to last January. For the past 18 consecutive months, average pay has grown at an annual pace of 3% or higher. We must continue to support pro-growth policies.&nbsp; Last week, I voted against the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act because it is exactly the kind of legislation that would cripple our economy. While it may sound well intentioned, its impact would be devastating. We currently have a record low unemployment rate because we have created a climate that allows small businesses to thrive. Small businesses are the backbone of our nation&#8217;s economy. When they are free to innovate and compete in the free market, jobs are created and wages rise.  Additionally, it was an honor to be recognized last week by the U.S. Travel Association for my work to reauthorize the Brand USA program. This public-private partnership has a solid record of attracting international tourists to the U.S. without costing the taxpayers a dime. Given that tourism is so important to the state of Florida's economy, passage of my bill was a priority.   Fighting for our Heroes  I'm continuing to work in a bipartisan manner to improve Veterans' access to benefits and ensure resources are used as efficiently as possible in order to meet the needs of our nation's heroes. This article outlines a bill I co-authored last week to help accomplish this goal.&nbsp;  In last week&#8217;s VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Hearing we discussed a variety of draft bills to help improve educational opportunities for Veterans. Click here to listen to my remarks during the hearing.&nbsp;  Last week, a bill I cosponsored passed the House. The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act creates a pilot program within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help combat Veterans address mental health issues by pairing them with dogs to train as service animals. The bill directs the VA to provide grants to nonprofits that teach Veterans to train service dogs. Upon completion of the program, Veterans can, if they wish, adopt their dogs for ongoing therapy. This is one small part of the work I&#8217;ve been doing to help Veterans gain access to alternative and complementary therapies. One size does not fit all when it comes to an issue as sensitive as addressing the mental health needs of our nation&#8217;s heroes and they deserve access to every type of treatment that has proven effective.   Additionally, several constituents have called my office recently asking for an update on the Zephyrhills VA Clinic. I received the following update from the VA Leadership Team:  \"The design phase took longer than anticipated due to strict VA guidelines for clinic construction, but the builder was able to make up some time and we are on track for clinic construction completion by the end of 2020 and full clinic activation in fall 2021.&#8221;  Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs  I was glad to hear the President call for bipartisan solutions for lowering prescription drug prices, something that has been a priority for me. HR 19 has over 40 provisions that have widespread bipartisan support. Let&#8217;s bring that bill to the Floor immediately.&nbsp;  Protecting Public Health   Fentanyl analogues are extremely dangerous and have been proven to be deadly for many Americans. While the Speaker waited until the deadline to extend this critical ban, I am glad the President was finally able to sign legislation that maintains the strictest safeguards to protect against abuse of this highly potent narcotic.   The current outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has dominated news headlines.&nbsp; As I mentioned last week, it is important to remain calm.&nbsp; The virus originated in China but has now spread internationally, impacting an increasing number of countries. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is taking the necessary precautions to protect the American public. However, the CDC always recommends everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including the following tips:   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. &nbsp; Visit the CDC website to learn more about prevention strategies.  Improving Transparency  We have been calling on FEMA to approve the updated flood maps for several years. I&#8217;m glad to see they will be implemented in just a few months because homeowners deserve an accurate and transparent process.&nbsp;  Praying for the Future of Our Nation  It was an honor to attend last week's National Prayer Breakfast. My prayer is that the leaders of our great nation will come together in unity to solve the problems that impact the daily lives of those we serve. I ask God to give leaders at all levels the humility, strength and grace to rise above division and prioritize the needs of our citizens.   Raising Awareness  Black History month allows us the opportunity to celebrate all of the unique contributions that African Americans have made to strengthen our nation.  February is also American Heart Month, a perfect time to learn how to prevent heart disease and keep #OurHearts healthy. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women, but is largely preventable. The most common type of heart disease affects 1,441,000 people in Florida. Click here to learn what you can do to protect your heart.&nbsp; Constituent Corner  Last week I received a call from a constituent in Holiday who thanked me for helping her father solve a problem with incorrect Social Security payments. They had been working with the Social Security Administration for more than 5 months. After calling my office, his problem was resolved within one week.  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  During last week's economic development meeting hosted by the North Tampa Bay Chamber, my team received an update from the Department of Transportation on current and anticipated transportation projects. Increased congestion is a major concern for all us who call the Tampa Bay area home. It is important that we continue to tackle the problem and develop solutions on a regional basis.    Last weekend, my team had the chance to speak to the Pasco County Housing Authority's Family Self Sufficiency Graduating Class. This wonderful program empowers families who want to transition from public housing to home ownership. Their stories are truly inspiring, and I wish them great success as they embrace the American dream.    Additionally, my team had the privilege of judging the Pasco County Science and Engineering Showcase. It is great to see students being exposed to a challenging STEM curriculum that encourages scientific discovery. These young students certainly have a bright future ahead.

Trump ended this week with an acquittal, leaving&nbsp;an indelible&nbsp;stain on the legacy of our great Constitution. The President is a clear and present danger to our democracy and our national security interests, and yet he will remain in office despite committing high crimes and misdemeanors for which Senate Republicans admitted there was ample evidence. As we saw with the President's Friday night massacre, he has emerged from this dark chapter not chastened, but emboldened to commit even higher crimes. Trump cheated to win the 2016 election, he&#8217;s cheating to try to win the 2020 election, and any rational person would expect more violations of our Constitution and the rule of law before&nbsp;Election Day this November. The House Managers presented incontrovertible proof that President Trump abused his power when he attempted to bribe an ally for dirt on a political rival and then worked to coverup his crimes, justifying his removal and disqualification from office. Nevertheless, Senate Republicans failed in their duty to be impartial jurors when they voted down the motion to seek additional witnesses and evidence&#8212;even as new evidence emerged during the trial that tied the President personally to the Ukraine pressure scheme more than two months before he asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political opponents in the July 25 call.  Senate Republicans voted almost entirely along party lines&#8212;with an exceptional and courageous vote to convict from Republican Sen. Mitt Romney&#8212;to let the President off the hook. I pray for brighter days for our democracy, although I fear that we do not yet realize the grave damage wrought by this shameful abdication of duty by Senate Republicans. A sham trial cannot provide a legitimate acquittal, and so this will forever be an impeached President and the Members of the Senate who failed in their duty will be complicit with his crimes from this day forward.&nbsp;  It was a truly dispiriting week in many respects, but there were also many high points that give me the conviction and hope to move forward. That includes the&nbsp;House's unanimous passage of my bill to provide $25 million in federal funds each year for five years for the restoration of the San Francisco Bay. I also had the honor of having Courtney Wild as my guest to this year's State of the Union (SOTU). Courtney's courage in&nbsp;breaking the silence on the abuse she suffered at the hands of sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein and her fight to ensure&nbsp;that she and other survivors receive the justice they were initially denied inspired me to name one of my bills after her. I also&nbsp;proudly led the effort with my Democratic Women's Caucus co-chairs to wear suffragist white to this year's SOTU, in honor of the centennial of the 19th Amendment. Our brilliant white outfits that stood out among a sea of dark suits sent a clear message to the President and the country that we will persist in our fight for true equality.  There was far more that happened, as you will see below, and be sure to keep an eye out for the next DC Dashboard as we move onward and upward into 2020.                   As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

I&#8217;ve introduced this legislation every Congress since 2010, and the threat to our Bay&#8217;s health has only worsened. Climate change, pollution, and human activity have caused an alarming 90 percent of the Bay&#8217;s wetlands to be destroyed. The San Francisco Bay is not only a national treasure, but also home to over 100 types of endangered species. It brings in $370 billion in goods and services annually and is home to over 3.5 million jobs. But between 2008 and 2016, the federal government invested a meager $45 million &#8211; far short of the $126 million in grant requests received by San Francisco Water Quality Improvement Fund (WQIF).  San Francisco Bay Restoration Act authorizes $25 million each year for five years to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fund water quality improvement projects, wetland and estuary restoration, endangered species recovery, and adaptation to climate change. We know that by 2030, the damage to our Bay will be irreversible. This increased federal funding will go a long way toward saving our Bay for our communities today and for future generations.  Voted to Table House Republicans&#8217; Pathetic Attempt to Censor a Powerful Woman This week, House Republicans introduced a resolution disapproving of Speaker Nancy Pelosi for ripping her copy of President Trump&#8217;s State of the Union remarks. The resolution claims that the Speaker&#8217;s action &#8220;degraded the proceedings of the joint session,&#8221; when it was clear to those watching that the State of the Union was degraded by the barrage of mistruths and bloviations the President performed during his game show of a speech. This resolution is a blatant attempt to curry favor with a mercurial President who rewards sycophantic loyalty with political support. I relished the opportunity to vote against such shameful pandering to Trump&#8217;s ego and support a Speaker who refuses to be silent in the face of an existential threat to American democratic values and truth.  Voted for Resolution Condemning the Trump Administration&#8217;s Attacks on Medicaid On Thursday, I voted in favor of House Resolution 826, expressing disapproval of the Trump Administration&#8217;s harmful actions towards the Medicaid program. In January, the Trump Administration announced a new waiver authority for states, laughably dubbed the &#8220;Health Adult Opportunity&#8221; program. This new authority provides anything but opportunity, as it would undermine crucial protections for some of the most vulnerable populations in our communities. The proposal would allow states to receive a waiver to block grant their Medicaid programs for adults in the expansion population, which translates to lower quality of care for fewer people. The Trump Administration argues that block grants would provide states more flexibility, but federal law already gives states significant flexibility &#8211; that&#8217;s why the Medicaid program in Alaska looks vastly different than Medicaid in California. This proposal is yet another attempt to weaken the Affordable Care Act and would come at the expense of millions of Americans and their health care.&nbsp;  Voted for H.R. 5687, to provide additional emergency aid to Puerto Rico On Thursday, I voted in favor of providing emergency supplemental aid to Puerto Rico. In the past several weeks, thousands of Puerto Ricans lost their homes after several large earthquakes rocked the island. Schools, roads, and infrastructure were destroyed, wiping out any progress since Hurricanes Maria and Irma. H.R. 5687 would provide an additional $4.67 billion for disaster relief and long-term recovery. President Trump has been dangerously slow in providing Puerto Rico with its federal disaster aid, and it&#8217;s clear that even more support and oversight is needed. Consequently, the emergency supplemental also includes accountability measures to address the Trump Administration&#8217;s illegal withholding of Puerto Rico relief and includes several tax-related provisions that will support families and encourage economic growth. The Senate and President must now move expediently to approve these funds so that our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico can recover and rebuild.  Voted for the PRO Act to Protect the Basic Right to Join a Union and Collectively Bargain This week, I had the honor of voting for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act to protect workers&#8217; rights. The PRO Act will safeguard our basic right to join a union by introducing meaningful penalties for companies and executives that violate workers&#8217; rights,&nbsp; expanding workers&#8217; collective bargaining rights and closing loopholes that corporations use to exploit workers and strengthening workers&#8217; access to fair union elections and requiring corporations to respect the results. The American economy is increasingly stacked in favor of large corporations at the expense of working families and the middle class. Over the last 40 years, average incomes for the bottom 90 percent of households increased 1.1 percent, while average incomes for the top 1 percent increased by more than 180 percent. This is wrong, and it&#8217;s in no small part due to the decimation of workers&#8217; rights to join a union and collectively bargain. I&#8217;m proud to have voted for such pro-worker legislation and will continue to fight our nation&#8217;s skyrocketing income inequality.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Organized Democratic Women in Wearing Suffragist White to the State of the Union and Brought Epstein Victim Courtney Wild as My Guest   here.  Chaired DWC Hearing&nbsp;Honoring #MeToo Silence Breakers with Action This week, I had the honor of hosting a hearing with brave silence breakers and experts to highlight the cultural shift we have seen with the #MeToo movement, the progress made, and the changes and legislation still needed to prevent and address workplace harassment. Our distinguished speakers included Drew Dixon, who is featured in the On the Record documentary about her sexual violence allegations against Russell Simmons; Kim Lawson, a McDonald&#8217;s worker and Fight for $15 leader; Liz Giorgi, the CEO of Soona; Gillian Thomas, Senior Staff Attorney at the ACLU Women&#8217;s Rights Project; and EEOC Commissioner Charlotte Burrows. Kim shared a heartbreaking story of having to move around shifts so she didn&#8217;t have to workhere.  Chaired MILPERS Hearing on Exceptional Family Member Program On Tuesday, the House Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing on the problems with the military&#8217;s Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). EFMP is supposed to help special needs families with military assignments, educational resources, and medical care, but too often falls far short of families&#8217; needs. As a nation we have a duty to ensure that our military families have access to the medical and educational resources that their children need. The testimony of military parents and advocates highlighted ways the Department of Defense (DOD) is failing these families, despite the availability of solutions.&nbsp; The DOD must treat this issue with more urgency. Parents focused on finding appropriate care for their kids will be less focused on their jobs. And if we make them choose between their families and jobs, they will rightly choose their families. I will continue to keep up my vigilant oversight&nbsp;of this problem to ensure that the DOD quickly adopts the changes necessary to bring these programs up to standard.   Roundtable Discussion on Access to Shelter and Housing for Domestic and Sexual Violence Survivors As Co-Chair of the Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I led a roundtable discussion with experts on the critical need for shelters and affordable housing for domestic and sexual violence survivors. Domestic violence (DV) survivors are four times as likely to become homeless and 84 percent of survivors report needing assistance with housing. The federal government has been woefully behind in developing policies that support survivors and their ability to regain independence after escaping an abusive relationship. Likewise, there remains a nationwide shortage of shelters specifically for domestic violence victims. Fifty percent of DV survivors report feeling unsafe in a standard homeless shelter &#8211; these shelters may not protect their identities or location, risking survivors&#8217; ability to remain safe from their abusers. While community education and resources for survivors has incrementally improved over the years, domestic violence remains a pervasive epidemic that consistently fails to receive the funding and attention it merits. In 2019, one in six homicides in New York were determined to be a result of domestic violence. This is unacceptable. We must reform our shelter systems and affordable housing opportunities to properly address the needs of survivors &#8211; lives are on the line.    Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives of BOMA from San Francisco  One of the best&nbsp;parts of my job is meeting with people&nbsp;from my district to hear about their ideas and to share with them the latest information on Capitol Hill. I hold meetings in both my DC and San Mateo offices and travel back home to the 14th District every weekend. I strongly believe that Members of Congress must maintain an open dialogue and keep in constant contact with individuals outside of the&nbsp;Beltway&nbsp;in order to more effectively represent the interests of their districts and communities.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District Each week, hundreds of my constituents reach out to my San Mateo and Washington, D.C. offices to express their concerns and support for issues and receive information about legislation and policies. Every constituent who writes in receives a personal response.  Here are some issues constituents raised this week: &#8226; 103 constituents expressed support for H.R. 2214, the NO BAN Act. I am a cosponsor of this important legislation that would prohibit religious discrimination in various immigration-related decisions, limit the President&#8217;s authority to restrict individuals from entering the United States, require specific evidence of a need for the restriction, and mandate that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consult Congress before imposing such a restriction and report to Congress periodically after its imposition.&nbsp;&#8226; 99 constituents shared support for conserving endangered species. I agree that we must ensure that endangered species are cherished and protected. While we have made great strides in protecting wildlife, recent efforts to derail the Endangered Species Act are part of a greater trend of politically-motivated assault on science in our country. You have my word that I will fight against these efforts and work to safeguard our wildlife conservation laws. &#8226; 38 constituents expressed support for asylum seekers on the border. We have a vital responsibility to protect immigrants against abuses of authority. Please know that I will continue to use my platform in Congress to combat the erosion of immigrant rights in the United States and fight for a return to respect for human dignity and tolerance.

A question was recently raised during a Facebook Town Hall that I hosted that asked how to protect yourself against the spread of the Coronavirus.  As you may know, the Coronavirus is a recently discovered virus that has spread to infect hundreds of people in China. While there have not been any reported cases in Connecticut it is always important to be vigilant. Here is what you need to remember as state and federal officials monitor the situation.  While vigilance is key, there is no cause for panic.

Trump of charges related to impeachment. The Senate did the right thing to vote for acquittal. In the House, Democrats had the opportunity to call witnesses, gather documents and hold interviews and hearings. They then voted to impeach the President of the United States without substantial evidence. In the Senate, both sides were given the chance to present their case with the entire country watching. However, it was again extremely clear that House Democrats fundamentally failed to prove their case. It is a tragedy that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wasted so much of the American people's time on this witch hunt. I applaud President Trump for not letting this sham get in his way and still delivering wins for hardworking Americans like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) while facing constant attacks. Now that this divisive charade is over, let's get back to work for the American people. THE STATE OF THE UNION President Trump delivered an inspiring and unifying State of the Union Address on Tuesday night. He spoke about the prosperity of our nation and recognized some great Americans among us. He spoke about a 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman, a proud mother with her daughter who received an opportunity scholarship, a brave American hero who surprised his family after returning home from deployment, and more. President Trump spoke about how the state of our union is strong. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi decided to rip up the House of Representative's copy of that speech while she was presiding over the joint session of Congress. By doing this, she not only disrespected the great Americans in the speech, but also all every single American across the country. I've signed on to a resolution to hold her accountable, and I have been working to bring this resolution to the House floor as soon as possible. After months of a divisive impeachment sham, our nation deserves better. I discuss the State of the Union and ending the impeachment charade in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

This morning I have the pleasure of speaking at the Armstrong campus of Georgia Southern University to the health care systems and advocacy class, an undergraduate course that is discussing pharmaceutical policy and the rising cost of prescription drugs. Of course, this subject is an area that I am focusing on in Congress and I enjoy sharing information on bills that I have passed and am currently sponsoring but more than anything I enjoy the questions from the students. Rep. Carter meeting with the Citizens Climate Lobby Afterwards, I head to our Savannah district office where I meet with a group lobbying on behalf of climate change and H.R. 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act which places a graduated fee on carbon and returns net revenue to households. My next meeting is with a group of health care advocates who are interested in developing policies and programs for a 21st century health care system followed by a meeting with a constituent who is interested in discussing sea level rise in Chatham County and the City of Savannah and shares with me details of a project she is working on studying the problem. After a meeting with my good friend Donna Camacho who does an outstanding job advocating for the Alzheimers Association, l have a conference call with leadership of JCB, Inc., to discuss tariffs that are being imposed on the company and could potentially impact the Savannah operation. Next, we have our weekly all district conference call to review last weeks activities in the district and what we have coming up this week.  Rep. Carter visits the Tiny House project Afterwards, I head to the Tiny House project in Savannah that is run by the Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless (CSAH) and meet with director Cindy Kelley as she takes me on a tour of the now completed project that includes a tiny medical clinic. Next, I head to downtown Savannah to meet with attendees of the Southeastern Aeroculture Fair before heading to the American Legion Post 184 in Thunderbolt for the Savannah Veterans Council meeting where we honor Doug Andrews who is retiring after 6 outstanding years of service as Chairman of the Veterans Council of Chatham County. I have the privilege of participating in the program and present Doug an American flag flown over the US Capitol in his honor.

I have asked from the beginning, \"What was the crime?\" The U.S. Senate has just answered that question. There wasn&#8217;t one.   Democrats&#8217; wasted months on a partisan impeachment fueled by their hatred for President Trump.  &nbsp;  THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG  This past week, President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address. During his speech, the President reiterated that the state of our union is strong &#8211; our economy continues to grow, more Americans are back to work, our military remains the best fighting force in the world, and U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses have a more level playing field in our global markets. Following the President&#8217;s speech, I sent out a poll to hear from constituents on how well they thought the President delivered his policy agenda and the top issues from his address that were important to you.&nbsp;Below are the results of our poll.&nbsp; If you missed the survey, you can click here to take it now.

Stands Up for Religious Dog Tags After Pentagon Caved to Secularist Group, The Washington Free Beacon  Greg Steube Wants Armed Forces Personnel to Have Concealed Carry Permits at Military Bases, Florida Daily  Legislative Update The Safe Bases Act Last week, I introduced the Safe Bases Act to give the Department of Defense the authority to issue concealed carry permits for active duty members of the Armed Forces who wish to carry on military installations. As we saw in the recent tragedy in Pensacola, gun free zones are a threat to our safety&#8212;even in the most secure environments. Active duty service members, who have extensive firearm training, should be afforded the opportunity to carry a concealed firearm to defend themselves and others. If we trust them on the battlefield with military equipment and firearms, then we should trust them at home on their installations to defend themselves and civilians working with them.  Moving H-2A to USDA Act On Thursday, I introduced the Moving H-2A to USDA Act to relocate the H-2A visa program from the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor to the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. Farmers across Florida rely on the H-2A visa program each year for temporary agricultural labor. Given that the purpose of the H-2A program is to address agricultural labor needs, it seems only logical that we would rely on the Department of Agriculture to review and grant these visas. It is my hope that with the transfer of this program, farmers in Florida and across America will see expedited review times and an overall improvement in the administration of the program. It&#8217;s time we trust the experts to manage this critical program and ensure the needs of our farmers are being met efficiently and effectively.    This Week in Washington We kicked off this week in Washington with the President&#8217;s State of the Union Address. With wages rising, unemployment dropping, and the economy booming, I am happy to say that the State of our Union is prosperous. The policies proposed by this administration are working for Floridians and Americans and I applaud the president for his steadfast commitment to making America great! After the speech, I spoke with media from across my district about the important issues the president addressed and my takeaways from the evening. Watch one of my interviews here:    On Wednesday, the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump. I applaud the Senate for their decisive action to acquit the president. Since the president was elected, Democrats have stopped at nothing to remove him from office because they know they can&#8217;t beat him at the ballot box. Thankfully, the voters will have the final say on all of this in November. I am hopeful that with this acquittal, we can move forward and get to the business of the American people by addressing real issues facing our nation. This week, I also had the privilege to attend the National Prayer Breakfast with President Trump and many other members of Congress. This is such a special event where we have the opportunity to celebrate our faith and the many blessings the Lord has bestowed upon our great nation. I was joined by my wife, Jennifer, and our dear friends Belinda and Bill Aubuchon from Nokomis and I even got to sing in the choir!       In addition to all of the special events this week, I also met with many wonderful Floridians who were visiting Washington, D.C. I was proud to accept the Council on Residential Excellence (CORE) Award from the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches.   I also met with the Florida Chiropractic Association to discuss Medicare reform and other important issues facing their industry.&nbsp;   It was an honor hosting students from the Port Charlotte Simon Youth Academy during their visit to Washington!

Facebook (Twitter (YouTube (Website (Friends, It was a historic week in Washington D.C. which included the Senate putting an end to the Democrats' impeachment sham, the President delivering an inspiring State of the Union address, and a January jobs report that blew estimates out of the water with 225,000 jobs added in the first month of 2020. On Tuesday, President Trump's State of the Union address championed the \"Great American Comeback,\" a bold and hopeful vision for the future of our nation. House Republicans have successfully worked with the Trump Administration to deliver a new era of American strength and prosperity. The President highlighted the historically strong economy that is benefiting families in Wyoming and across the country: * 3.5% unemployment rate, the lowest in 50 years * U.S. consumer confidence at highest levels since 2000 * Highest level of entrepreneurial activity recorded in the last two decades * Median household family incomes grown by nearly 8 percent under President Trump Additionally, the President reaffirmed his commitment to Americas military and our leadership around the world. The guests he invited, stories he told, and policies he outlined reminded us of all that is best about America. Click on the video below to watch my interview with Fox Business previewing the State of the Union address. In stark contrast, Democrats' response to the positive vision outlined by President Trump in the State of the Union was disgraceful, but unsurprising. Between their members staging an episode of political theater by walking (out (, to refusing to applaud common-sense accomplishments (like awarding scholarships to students that need them or lowering unemployment rates for disabled veterans, they showed their true colors. At the conclusion of the speech, Speaker Pelosi had a tantrum, disgraced herself, and dishonored the House by ripping up a copy of President Trump's speech (. She is an embarrassment and should apologize to the American people for her behavior. On Wednesday morning, I joined Wyomings Lets Talk With Al Harris (on KUGR 1490 AM to recap the State of the Union Address. We touched on the inspiring stories of the Presidents guests including a Tuskegee Airman, a young girl receiving a scholarship for school, and a soldier returning home to his family. We also discussed how the President has successfully rebuilt our military and enhanced our national security by taking out terrorist leaders Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Qassem Soleimoni. Click below to listen to the full interview. Rep. Liz Cheney Joins Let's Talk With Al Harris | February 5, 2020 On Wednesday, Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, did the right thing in voting to acquit President Trump of the Democrats' articles of impeachment. This effort was political from day one and Democrats' goal to impeach the President began the day he was inaugurated. When House Democrats launched their formal impeachment inquiry, they completely denied due process or fairness. Democrats then rushed the process, putting their political timeline before any legitimate search for truth or the facts. Throughout the process, Democrats ground all of the nations business to a halt, preventing Congress from focusing on the issues that matter to the American people because of this partisan impeachment. The country will hold Democrat leaders accountable for abandoning the Constitution and abdicating their oaths of office. Democrats proved that they cannot be trusted to put their responsibility to the country before their political self-interest, and that is something the American people will long remember. As a member of the House leadership team, I was proud to help lead the fight against the impeachment sham and uphold our Constitution. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Interior announced (it would provide nearly $36 million to Wyoming this year in Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation grants, to clean up and repurpose abandoned coal mines. As the nations leading coal producer and largest contributor to the AML fund, Wyomings coal communities rightly deserve these critical resources. These grants, which I have fought hard to protect, support investment in reclamation projects and leading-edge technologies like carbon capture. These hard-earned funds will create new economic opportunities while enhancing Wyoming's land and water resources.

My provision would provide certainty for permit and leaseholders on public lands. Livestock producers have long battled against the federal governments attempts to reduce grazing on public lands. My bill is crucial to safeguarding ranchers, who legally graze on federal lands, from frivolous lawsuits that force them off their allotments, leaving them no choice other than to sell their livestock at fire-sale prices and subjecting them to economic ruin. My proposal ensures they will be able to continue to graze on public lands as they have for generations and it fulfills the intended mission of the multiple-use doctrine by protecting the interests of stakeholders in Wyoming. These reforms, in addition to the other pieces of legislation included in this package, are key to modernizing the ESA and bringing it into the 21st century. * Earlier this month, I introduced the Creating Opportunities And Leveraging Technologies for Coal Carbon Act ((COAL TeCC), legislation to establish a carbon technologies program at the Department of Energy (DOE) to advance research for coal-driven carbon products. As the nations largest coal-producing state, the people of Wyoming know that coal is more than just a critical energy source. New technologies have opened up unlimited applications for coal as a carbon-based product used in automobile frames, airplanes, electronic devices, and plastics. The unique composition of coal has the potential to create stronger, lighter, and less expensive carbon-based materials, providing coal communities in Wyoming with an important source of jobs and revenue. Investing in carbon-based technology and research strengthens the reality of coal as one of Americas most versatile and valuable natural resources. ** Armed Services Committee ------------------------------------------------------------ * On Monday, I joined Congressman Michael McCaul, the lead Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to introduce a resolution denouncing the United Kingdoms decision (to allow Huawei to build part of their 5G networks. I've been a leading voice (in fighting back against the Chinese Communist Party-controlled telecommunications companys attempts to infiltrate and spy on Americas allies. Allowing Huawei into the U.K.s 5G networks would pose a national security threat that could not be mitigated or contained. I've also joined my colleague, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, i (n introducing a bill (that would bar the U.S. from sharing intelligence with any country that allows Huawei into its 5G networks. * Last week, President Trump outlined his vision (to help create peace, prosperity, and a brighter future for Israel and the Palestinian people. The plan put forward by the President is a historic step towards bringing peace, security, and prosperity to a region that has long endured conflict and turmoil. President Trumps plan re-affirms Americas unwavering commitment to the security and survival of the state of Israel and establishes a path forward for the Palestinian people to turn away from terrorism and embrace a future of freedom and prosperity. I applaud the President and his team for their commitment to working with our allies to bring peace, security, and prosperity to a troubled region. Visits Thank you to the Wyoming members of the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America who stopped by my office to discuss the importance of keeping our communities drug free.

President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address &#8212; an uplifting celebration of the diversity of the American experience and the triumph of the American spirit. The terrorist leader of al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula, who claimed to have orchestrated the NAS Pensacola shooting, has been eliminated.  Finally, and at long last, the sham impeachment trial has come to an end, and President Trump has been acquitted. Now that impeachment is finally over, will House Democrats get back to work for the American people? (The answer, unfortunately, seems to be&nbsp;&#8220;no.&#8221;)    TERRORIST KILLED On Sunday, Qasim al-Rimi, a cofounder of al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola in December.  On Thursday, February 6, the White House announced that Qasim al-Rimi was dead. On behalf of the thousands of patriots in Northwest Florida, I thank President Trump for his swift action in eliminating this brutal terrorist.&nbsp;  During his State of the Union address, the President stated that any assault on our freedom would be met with overwhelming, disproportionate retribution. He has kept his word. We are a safer, stronger nation tonight because of his leadership. &nbsp;  STATE OF THE UNION On the night of Tuesday, February 4, the President delivered his third State of the Union address. President Trump opened up his speech by declaring that &#8220;the state of our union is stronger than ever before.&#8221; He&#8217;s right. Wages are growing to new highs, the economy is soaring, and unemployment is at a 50-year low. Our nation has prospered greatly since President Trump took office, and his policies have led to success for ALL Americans.  The President&#8217;s remarks were uplifting and triumphant. It was a moving address, and well worth watching. Unfortunately, the conclusion of the speech was overshadowed by a political stunt from Speaker Pelosi.  &nbsp;  PELOSI&#8217;S DISGRACE At the conclusion of the President&#8217;s State of the Union address, while he received thunderous applause and a standing ovation, the Speaker took her copy of his prepared remarks and tore them in half. It is hard to overlook the symbolism of such a gesture &#8212; the sense that Speaker Pelosi was utterly dismissive of the President&#8217;s achievements and guests, and, more importantly, the achievements and success of the American people.  Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s gesture reflects poorly on her Speakership, and on the House of Representatives as a whole. The Speaker should not let her personal feelings about the President color her behavior as a leader in the United States Congress. This behavior is utterly unbecoming of the Speaker of the House.  I have sent a letter to the House Committee on Ethics, asking that they investigate the matter, and recommending that they censure the Speaker.  Tearing up this document was certainly distasteful &#8212; and was likely illegal, too. A section of federal law () states that &#8220;Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys [&#8230;] any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office [&#8230;] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.&#8221; Unlike the copies of the State of the Union address available elsewhere, Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s was an original, hand-signed copy. During State of the Union addresses, the President hand-delivers a copy of his remarks to the Speaker of the House, and to the President of the Senate (the Vice President). Those two copies are the &#8216;original&#8217; documents, from which all subsequent copies are made. They are not the &#8220;personal property&#8221; of the recipients. They are the property of Congress.  There is no question whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi &#8220;mutilated, obliterated, or destroyed&#8221; the copy of the President&#8217;s address provided to her at the beginning of the evening. The video evidence is clear and abundant; the Speaker herself gleefully acknowledged her actions. The Speaker cannot be above the law.  On Thursday night, I joined Laura Ingraham to discuss my letter to the Committee on Ethics. Watch it here:        Click to play!    &nbsp;  PRESIDENT ACQUITTED Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced an impeachment inquiry five months ago, but the &#8216;impeachment investigation&#8217; really began many months before that. For nearly a year, Democrats have been wasting Congress&#8217;s time, energy, and resources &#8212; with little to show for their efforts except heartburn.  If impeachment had not consumed Democrats&#8217; every waking moment, we could have had many bipartisan successes &#8212; from lowering prescription drug prices to rebuilding America&#8217;s infrastructure.  Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t been the case. My Republican colleagues and I have been preaching that this was a political stunt since the beginning &#8212; and on Wednesday, February 5, we were proved right, when the Senate concluded its impeachment trial and voted to acquit the President on both of the baseless charges levied against him. Of the 248 Republican members of the House and Senate, only one voted to convict the President. Mitt Romney chose pettiness and jealousy over objectivity.  We saw extreme moderates such as Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins vote to exonerate the President. This illustrates with clarity that this impeachment was purely political, and Romney&#8217;s vote was borne of bitterness, not principle. I am glad to put this national nightmare behind us, and hope that Congress will finally get back to working to help the American people.  &nbsp;  AROUND THE DISTRICT CHILDCARE FOR OUR HEROES The military families in our district sacrifice a great deal for America. But one sacrifice they should not have to make is childcare. Many military parents must drive to Eglin Air Force Base for childcare, which can add hours onto their daily commute.  Our military personnel protect our families, and we must return the favor. Not only does a lengthy and difficult commute hurt our military families, it also impacts our military readiness. The intense nature of the Special Forces Group demands the complete attention of participants, and when our operators are thinking about the strain on their families at home, they are not focused on their mission. This week, I wrote a letter with Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to urge to Secretary McCarthy to address the lack of childcare facilities for the 7th&nbsp;Special Forces Group. I look forward to hearing from the Secretary and lightening the burden for Northwest Florida&#8217;s warfighters. Read the letter here:    &nbsp;  JOSEPH AINSWORTH ACT Military veterans are the heartbeat of Northwest Florida.  Under current law, veterans whose net worth exceeds a certain threshold are ineligible for pension benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) calculates a veterans&#8217; net worth by evaluating the sum of the veterans&#8217; assets, plus their annual income. If that value exceeds the limitation the VA has set, the veteran is not eligible to receive pension benefits. This week, I introduced the Joseph Ainsworth Act along with fellow Florida representatives Ross Spano and Darren Soto. This bill would eliminate the &#8216;Net Worth Limitation&#8217; for veterans over 99 years of age &#8212; allowing centenarian veterans to qualify for full pension benefits from the VA, regardless of their net worth. Eliminating this rule for our military heroes who have achieved such a milestone in their life will help alleviate the financial burdens they and their families frequently endure. Furthermore, it also helps show our nation&#8217;s gratitude for these veterans&#8217; devotion to America. It is my hope that First Lieutenant Joseph Ainsworth&#8217;s situation will be eradicated for future centenarian military veterans, and that his service to our country will be immortalized through this legislation. A copy of the Joseph Ainsworth Act is available HERE.  &nbsp;  VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT The military is not a feature of our district &#8212; it is the defining characteristic.  Northwest Florida has been built by the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect America, and our cherished American values: freedom, justice, and the rule of law. It&#8217;s easy to walk down the street and forget how lucky we are to live amongst heroes.  Since the Library of Congress started the Veteran&#8217;s History Project in 200, over 6,000 Floridians have submitted their stories, but I know there are more out there. This week, we continued our efforts to uncover more of these stories. I look forward to hearing more about the lives of the men and women who have made our country great.

Morgan Griffith","address":"Griffith.News@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-07","subject":"Good News from the FCC","body":"Good News From the FCC For rural areas such as ours, safe and reliable methods of telecommunications are vital. We count on them to stay connected with each other, foster new economic opportunities, and engage with the wider world. In the House of Representatives, where I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over telecommunications, I fight to make sure communities such as ours are properly served. The agency charged with carrying out the telecommunications laws passed by Congress is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It regulates radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable communications in the United States. In recent weeks, it has taken several encouraging steps that will contribute to expanded and improved telecommunications services in the Ninth Congressional District of Virginia. Broadband Broadband Internet service is indispensable for job creation, education, and various other activities in the modern world, but many sparsely populated communities are not connected. Closing the digital divide between rural and urban areas is a necessity, and to help achieve this goal, the FCC at its January 30 meeting established the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. Its goal is to direct $20.4 billion over the next ten years to building fast broadband networks in unserved rural areas. The first phase of this plan will begin later this year, with $16 billion in funding going to areas that are not served at all. Virginia has an estimated 217,000 home and business locations that would be eligible for Phase I of the funding. Subsequently, $4.4 billion will be made available to support areas that enjoy partial service. This planned investment by the FCC marks a significant commitment to addressing the needs of rural areas. Still better, more good news on broadband may be on the way. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has announced a plan for new rules around television white spaces to be considered at the commissions February meeting. TV white spaces are unused spectrum between stations. They can be adapted for other purposes, including providing broadband services in rural areas. Chairman Pais plan would change the FCCs rules on white spaces, enhancing the ability of innovators to use them for broadband delivery. More investment and greater flexibility to use white spaces will help connect rural areas. What are some of the possible benefits? More appeal to businesses and job creators to locate here. Greater availability to educational resources. Aid to farmers via precision agriculture. I will note in particular one benefit: increased use of telehealth, which can make it easier for patients to check in with their health care providers and thus support better outcomes. I have championed telehealth as a health care solution in our area, and the FCC last year even made the announcement in Carroll County of its plans for a $100 million Connected Care Pilot Program. Better broadband access will also serve the purpose of expanding telehealths reach. The FCC under Chairman Pai has shown a true commitment to closing the digital divide, and I applaud their efforts. Robocalls In contrast to broadband, where the problem is a lack of access, the problem with our telephones lately is that they are being abused by illegal robocalls. This was a problem that received bipartisan attention in Congress and in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We passed the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act last year, and President Trump signed it into law. The FCC is one of the agencies charged with executing this law. It has urged phone companies to allow tracing of robocalls from foreign sources and moved toward selecting an entity to lead efforts in the private sector to trace illegal robocalls. The U.S. Department of Justice, which also has responsibility to enforce the TRACED Act, filed actions against entities facilitating illegal robocalls. These actions are important. Although passage of the TRACED Act was a significant achievement against illegal robocalls, it will not get rid of them overnight. Success will depend on enforcement. I am glad to see federal agencies taking steps to carry out the law. If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.

The President&#8217;s emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, and I&#8217;ve been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.   I am especially proud that President Trump announced his public support for my bicameral, bipartisan voluntary paid leave bill for hardworking families that does not increase taxes or create a new government program.This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy. This effort is yet another example of the critical, bipartisan work in Congress that I am proud to lead with the support of my colleagues.&nbsp; During his remarks, President Trump also surprised the family of Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams with his unexpected return from deployment in Afghanistan. Sergeant Williams is originally a native of Peru, New York. He is also a past Peru Fire Department Firefighter. I am proud that Sergeant Williams hails from the North Country, and it was incredible to witness him and his family reunite as they were honored for the sacrifices they have made in the name of our freedom. I thank Sergeant Williams for his service, and I am proud that President Trump reaffirmed his support for our military families. I was also proud to have David Fisher, dairy farmer from St. Lawrence County, accompany me to the State of the Union as my guest. David and the Fisher family have been operating Mapleview Dairy for four generations in Madrid, New York. David has been an active member of his community, serving on the Madrid Town Board for many years, and is currently also in his second term as President of the New York Farm Bureau. He has been an outspoken advocate for farmers in the North Country. He is well versed on agriculture issues and always makes sure that Upstate New York agriculture has a seat at the table, particularly on results like the USMCA. It was great to have him in the audience.

Throughout this unfair and unprecedented process, I proudly stood up for the Constitution, the facts of the case, and my constituents in New York&#8217;s 21st district. I applaud the Senate&#8217;s diligence in their trial and just acquittal of the President. I'm looking forward to getting back to work for the American people.&nbsp; Meeting with Constituents and Organizations Important to the North Country        It was great to meet with a variety of constituent groups and organizations important to my work on behalf of the North Country this week. I discussed the importance of rural broadband, funding for students with disabilities, and school safety with the New York State School Board Association. I met with the North Country Workforce Development Board leadership about increasing access to affordable child care, workforce development priorities, and helping dislocated workers and rehabilitated former non-violent offenders successfully reenter the workforce. I also met with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to discuss prison reform and funding for the drug free communities program. We also discussed the vaping epidemic facing our youth and the need for funding to go towards addiction prevention and education. It is always great to meet with constituents from the district and discuss the issues most important to them. Hearing directly from my constituents guides my work and priorities in Congress. Opposing New York State Law Causing Suspension of Global Entry, Trusted Traveler Programs for New York Residents  This week, in response to New York State&#8217;s &#8220;Green Light Law&#8221;, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced their decision to suspend enrollment in Global Entry and other trusted-traveler programs for New York State residents. The &#8220;Green Light Law&#8221;, which took effect in December 2019, allows issuance of a driver&#8217;s license to illegal immigrants. In making their decision, DHS cited that the state&#8217;s sanctuary policies that safeguard immigrants from deportation. DHS will immediately stop accepting new applications from New York State residents to enroll or re-enroll in some of the agency&#8217;s travel programs, including Global Entry. New York is the only state to be impacted by DHS&#8217;s decision thus far. After repeatedly ignoring law enforcement experts at the federal and local level, Governor Cuomo&#8217;s prioritization of illegal immigrants over law abiding New Yorkers is continuing to have damaging effects. The Governor&#8217;s reckless Green Light Law not only has hampered efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, it is continuing to have harmful implications for our state. In December of last year, I warned Governor Cuomo that this irresponsible policy would inhibit our CBP officers at the Northern Border from doing their jobs. Qualified, legal citizens should not be penalized by the Governor&#8217;s unconscionable actions, which not only hinder our border patrol, law enforcement, and other agencies from being able to effectively do their job, but now also prevent our residents from receiving access to important travel programs. Read more here.  Helping the House Pass the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act  This week, I voted in favor of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, legislation that I proudly cosponsored. This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and helps meet the needs of communities by increasing funding and reauthorizes the program through the next five years. Over the past decade, the GLRI has assisted Great Lakes communities after decades of environmental damage threatened public health, regional economies, and drinking water. The GLRI has enabled the 8-state region along the Great Lakes to undertake one of the world&#8217;s largest freshwater ecosystem restoration projects. Assisting our communities in cleaning up their drinking water systems, restoring fish and wildlife habitats, and combating invasive species are critical examples of how this GLRI funding benefits North Country communities. This funding plays an essential role in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes and the ecosystems that surround them, and I am proud to continue to advocate in full support of its projects.

I am proud to be leading the effort in coordinating support between local and state elected officials, community groups, and local businesses in the area surrounding Fort Drum to advocate for the installation&#8217;s selection as the final site. I sent a letter to the Army advocating for Fort Drum's designation, and led many petitions, signed by hundreds of constituents with more signing on each day, in support of the stationing and activation of the additional headquarters at Fort Drum. My offices have worked closely with Advocate Drum to coordinate an outpouring of support from the North Country. Fort Drum is the best option for the activation and stationing of the Army&#8217;s fourth corps headquarters, and I am proud to be passionately advocating for this alongside my constituents. As the number one advocate for Fort Drum, I have worked tirelessly to lead the coordination efforts across the North Country, to build support for the Army&#8217;s consideration. I will continue to raise awareness that Fort Drum has unmatched capabilities and ready to rapidly expand to meet the criteria to support an Army corps headquarters. Read more here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!    Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read:  Watertown Daily Times -&nbsp;President references Stefanik legislation in SOTU address  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said President Donald Trump delivered an &#8220;incredibly strong&#8221; State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he highlighted the Congresswoman&#8217;s legislation on paid leave and child tax credit.&#8220;The President&#8217;s emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country,&#8221; Ms. Stefanik said after the address, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.&#8221;&nbsp;During the address, Mr. Trump said he was proud to sign a law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave. And he called on Congress to pass the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, which he said would extend family leave to mothers and fathers across the nation.  &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful President Trump highlighted my bipartisan, bicameral legislation during his State of the Union address,&#8221; Ms. Stefanik said. &#8220;This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy.&#8221;&nbsp;Ms. Stefanik said the act would allow families the option to advance up to $5,000 of their recently-doubled child tax credit in the first year of a child&#8217;s life or the first year a family adopts a child. Most other paid leave proposals require parents to take off work to receive benefits, a release from Ms. Stefanik said. This bill allows teleworkers the option to access child care benefits and to continue working from home while they take care of their new child.   The bill does not raise taxes or take away from Social Security. It is the product of more than a year of work to craft a bill that could pass with bipartisan support, the release said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  _________________ Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:  Federal agencies.

Eight years ago, when I took my first oath of office in Congress, I swore to support and defend the US Constitution. I thought of that oath often as the House considered whether to impeach President Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;voted for impeachment&nbsp;because of the overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power by asking a foreign country to meddle in our election and then trying to cover up his wrongdoing by obstructing the House&#8217;s investigation. History will judge the Senate&#8217;s vote yesterday to acquit President Trump. As the House continues our work on behalf of the American people, we will build on the&nbsp;hundreds of bipartisan bills&nbsp;we have already passed&#8212;and&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;uphold our Constitutional duty&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a vigorous&nbsp;check on the Trump administration.     Join Me at a Town Hall Meeting in April Every year I hold town hall meetings around NW Oregon so I can hear firsthand from the people I&#8217;m honored to represent. My spring series of town hall meetings will include six events in April. Please join me! There will be additional details for&nbsp;each event on my website&nbsp;soon. All weekday events will be in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Vernonia &nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 6&nbsp;   Tigard &nbsp; Tuesday, April 7&nbsp;   Portland &nbsp; Saturday, April 11&nbsp;   Warrenton &nbsp; Monday, April 13&nbsp;   McMinnville &nbsp; Tuesday, April 14&nbsp;   Hillsboro &nbsp; Thursday, April 16&nbsp;       We All Need Health Care Access to&nbsp;health care is a human right, but far too often people in our community face communication, cultural, and financial barriers that prevent them from accessing care. That&#8217;s why I brought Serena Cruz, the Executive Director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation and an advocate for health care accessibility and immigrant rights,&nbsp;as&nbsp;my guest at the State of the Union address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center&nbsp;provides&nbsp;critical&nbsp;health care&nbsp;services&nbsp;and is named for a six-year-old daughter of migrant farm workers who died after a cut in her foot became infected. If she had been able to access health care, Virginia would have turned 51 years old&nbsp;last month. Today, Serena reports that the clinic is seeing pregnant women who are too afraid to seek the prenatal care they need because of the frequent attacks by&nbsp;President&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;and&nbsp;his administration on&nbsp;immigrants&nbsp;and&nbsp;people of color. We must stand up for all members of our community. In Congress, I am committed to stopping hateful policies and fighting for increased access to health care for all.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt Addressing the high cost of higher education is one of my priorities, and one of the reasons I entered public service. Students today face a very different reality than I did: I was able to work my way through community college, a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and a law degree with a manageable amount of debt. When I sent out a survey about student loans last fall, more than 700 people responded. They described their student debt as being stressful, burdensome, painful, and overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; To help these borrowers and others like them, I recently&nbsp;held a clinic on student loan debt&nbsp;with a national expert. There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to address crushing student debt, like making it easier for borrowers to access and stay in&nbsp;affordable&nbsp;repayment plans. The House Education &amp; Labor Committee included that provision and several others I drafted in the College Affordability Act. I hope the House will vote on this legislation soon to provide needed relief to students and borrowers.&nbsp;     At Home and at the Border,&nbsp; Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies Cause Harm I recently visited the Southern Border&nbsp;to investigate the Trump Administration&#8217;s Remain in Mexico policy, which has&nbsp;stranded tens of thousands of asylum-seekers&nbsp;in dirty and dangerous tent camps. In Matamoros, Mexico, I&nbsp;saw families and many children living in squalor, without running water or adequate food.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;no way to treat families&nbsp;who are coming to the United States to escape violence&nbsp;or persecution and who have the right to request asylum under international law.  When I returned home I met with nine asylum-seekers, including an unaccompanied child, who are participating in the legal asylum process. They told me about the dangers they fled and the hardship they have experienced here, all in the hope of making their case for asylum and building a better life in the United States of America.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too often this administration has attacked immigrants and fueled racism and xenophobia. In a roundtable discussion with&nbsp;a dozen local advocates, I heard about how fear and anxiety is clouding the lives of our immigrant neighbors, including&nbsp;Dreamers who have known no other home&nbsp;and now risk being deported. I&nbsp;stand with our immigrant neighbors&nbsp;and our friends, who are an integral part of our communities and&nbsp;must&nbsp;be treated with dignity.&nbsp;    In Case You Missed It  I helped improve the&nbsp;major new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada&nbsp;in the areas of labor, environment, access to medicines, and enforcement. After a protracted battle with the Administration, we secured an&nbsp;agreement that is better for Oregonians, workers, and the environment.&nbsp; My bipartisan&nbsp;Blue Carbon for the Planet Act&nbsp;will harness the powerful ability of&nbsp;healthy wetlands, tidal marshes, and seagrasses&nbsp;to&nbsp;sequester&nbsp;carbon for centuries or even millennia and mitigate the climate crisis.&nbsp; The House passed the&nbsp;bipartisan&nbsp;Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,&nbsp;which&nbsp;I co-led, to&nbsp;protect the&nbsp;civil rights of older workers&nbsp;in the workplace.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;helped advance&nbsp;legislation to&nbsp;make sure that&nbsp;pregnant workers&nbsp;have the accommodations they need&nbsp;to&nbsp;work and stay healthy&nbsp;during pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal funding will support the&nbsp;Portland Art Museum&#8217;s new Rothko Pavilion&nbsp;and the renovation of the&nbsp;Astoria Library.&nbsp; I was proud to lead a group of my colleagues in&nbsp;nominating Saudi women&#8217;s rights activist&nbsp;Loujain&nbsp;al&nbsp;Hathoul&nbsp;for the Nobel Peace&nbsp;Prize.&nbsp;

The MPP allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to return applicants for admission to the United States to Mexico, pending their asylum application hearings. I&#8217;ve visited refugee camps around the world, and the conditions that the U.S. government is forcing these asylum-seekers to suffer are a disgrace to our nation and our shared values.&nbsp;   Congressman DeFazio standing in front of a makeshift shelter in the city of Matamoros, Mexico, which contains the largest refugee camp along the U.S.-Mexico Border of an estimated 2,000 people.  In Matamoros, I witnessed roughly 3,000 individuals living in squalor. Half are children. It is so dangerous, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisory&#8212;the same as Iran and Syria&#8212;for the area. The Mexican cartel operates openly and freely, and kidnapping, violence, and sexual assault are rampant. I met one woman who had fled El Salvador with her three daughters. Every night she sleeps outside her tent, on the zipper, to protect her daughters from being kidnapped and forced into sex trafficking. Despite widespread disease, including numerous cases of chronic infections, medical care is woefully inadequate. Basic infrastructure is also almost non-existent: open latrines filled with raw sewage exist immediately next to the Rio Grande, the contaminated river where families wash their laundry.&nbsp;  On the day of their hearing, individuals must arrive at the border checkpoint by 4:30 AM. Most petitioners are unable to see their court paperwork until that day. Approximately one percent of asylum-seekers have a lawyer, and if they are lucky enough to have representation, they usually meet their lawyer for the first time on the day of their hearing. They are given, at most, an hour to discuss their case and the hearing.&nbsp;  An estimated 60,000 asylum seekers have been forced back into Mexico under the MPP. Of those 60,000, roughly 120 have been granted asylum or some other relief.  We need to end the Remain in Mexico policy now. That&#8217;s why I am one of roughly 50 members of Congress cosponsoring H.R. 2662, the Asylum Seeker Protection Act, which would terminate the deplorable MPP program.&nbsp;  I hope more members of Congress go to Matamoros to bear witness to these conditions for themselves. Perhaps then Congress will finally have the courage to act.  Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr, &nbsp;His Legacy, and the Fight for Equality On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I was honored to address members of the Eugene community about Dr. King&#8217;s legacy of equality and the incredible contributions of women across the nation and in our community to promote equity. Since taking office, the president and the GOP have implemented policies that threaten the rights &nbsp;of women and people of color.&nbsp;  I am frustrated that many hard-won civil rights battles are at risk in today&#8217;s political climate. As my friend and colleague, civil rights hero Congressman John Lewis noted, &#8220;Of all the gifts given us by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I think the greatest has been the belief in society&#8217;s ability to change and the power each of us has to affect that change.&nbsp; We must not give up our fight.&#8221;   &#8220;There is no expiration date on equality,&#8221; Watch my full remarks to the Eugene MLK Jr. Day March here.  In January, Virginia became the pivotal 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), finally guaranteeing equal protections regardless of sex in our nation&#8217;s Constitution. With Virginia&#8217;s action, the ERA could finally be added to our Constitution &#8211; but the Trump administration&#8217;s Department of Justice is determined to stop this from happening and has issued a legal opinion arguing that the ratification deadline has passed. Well to them I say this &#8211; there is no expiration date on equality.  I am a proud cosponsor of H.J.Res. 38, legislation which would lift the arbitrary ERA ratification deadline. Majority Leader Hoyer has already announced his intention to bring this important legislation to the floor next month, and I look forward to giving it my full &nbsp;support.&nbsp;  I have also cosponsored and voted for legislation to fight for equality, such as tackling the wage discrimination that women and minorities face (H.R. 7 &#8211; Paycheck Fairness Act), protecting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault (H.R. 1585 &#8211; Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act), and protecting a women&#8217;s right to choose (H.R. 2975, Women&#8217;s Health Protection Act, H.R. 1692 &#8211; EACH Woman Act).&nbsp;  Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a priority to fight for equality. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment which guaranteed women&#8217;s constitutional right to vote, you can be sure I will continue to do everything in my power to defend a woman&#8217;s right to choose, protect access to critical healthcare, and strive to ensure the ERA&#8217;s addition to our Constitution. Discussing Science and Policy with OSU Students Last week, I spoke with Oregon State University students at a Science and Policy class taught by Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a world-renowned environmental scientist who served as the U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and served as an inaugural member of President Barack Obama&#8217;s Science Team from 2009-2013. We discussed the importance of integrating fact-based science and policy to inform policymakers on the existential crisis of climate change.  On the &nbsp;same day, a new report from NOAA revealed the devastating effects climate change is already inflicting on Dungeness crabs fisheries in the Pacific Northwest. The study found that ocean acidification along the Pacific Northwest is impacting the shells and sensory organs of Dungeness crabs, which could cause developmental delays and interfere with maturation. The Dungeness crab fishery is a multi-million-dollar industry in Oregon, and the report is one more disturbing example of just how urgent and overdue legislative action is. That&#8217;s why I am a cosponsor of the COAST Research Act, which would address the effects of ocean acidification on our marine ecosystems. This legislation, which passed the House with my full support last year, would reauthorize the Ocean Acidification Program of NOAA and expand research efforts to monitor the effects of coastal acidification. While I am proud that the House was able to pass this legislation, there is much more work that needs to be done to protect our oceans and address climate change.&nbsp;  The ability to protect the environment and address climate change is dependent on the foundation of science that is independently verifiable and free from political interference or bias, ideology, and conflicts of interests. I have and will continue to promote policies that are based in science, protect our environment, and reduce carbon pollution. Juliana v. United States Case Dismissed, But Not Defeated&nbsp; I&#8217;m angered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals&#8217; dismissal of the landmark&nbsp;Juliana v. United States, a&nbsp;constitutional climate lawsuit led by 21 youth plaintiffs, including seven from Oregon&#8217;s 4th Congressional District. In the face of a president and Republican-led Senate who blatantly ignore and discount the existential threat posed by climate change, the youth plaintiffs are working to bring our nation one step closer to achieving a legal foundation and requirement to solve this crisis. Last year, I was proud to back the youth plaintiffs by filing an amicus curiae brief with the Ninth Circuit Court. The plaintiffs of this lawsuit understand that the existential threat of climate change denies them the kind of future we should all be guaranteed under the Constitution. While the plaintiffs have requested the full Ninth Circuit to review the decision, Congress&nbsp;must&nbsp;take urgent action on climate change. As Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am working on a 21st Century transportation bill that will take dramatic steps to reduce carbon pollution and make significant investments in green technologies. I will continue to push Congress towards bold, transformative action that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, curtail greenhouse gas emissions, and protect our planet for future generations.

He outlined the Great American Comeback story that he and his Administration have led. During the speech, he laid out an optimistic vision about how we can continue this progress and build a better future for all. Continuing reading to see my full statement on the State of the Union speech. Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump on the partisan articles of impeachment sent to them by House Democrats. Congress has been tied up for months with the House Democrats impeachment obsession. Partisan politics need to be put aside. It&#8217;s long past time to put this impeachment charade behind us and get back to work for the American people.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   State of the Union President Trump continues to put America first and advance the interests of our nation. The strong economy under this administration is lifting Americans everywhere. This administration successfully negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which created 176,000 new jobs, added $68 billion in new economic growth and was a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses. He also delivered on a historic &#8220;Phase One&#8221; trade agreement with China. I was happy to hear the President speak on the jobs created in the opportunity zones established in the Republican tax cut bill. In Georgia, 260 opportunity zones have attracted investments &#8211; including in Muscogee County &#8211; and brought new economic opportunities to our local community. This administration has made tremendous progress in fixing our broken immigration system and securing our border. I was pleased to hear the President&#8217;s plans to continue building a safe and legal immigration system by facing head-on the public safety threat posed by sanctuary cities. The President&#8217;s remarks on issues facing working families, from ensuring that every child can get a great education, to supporting America&#8217;s parents as they manage the demands of their careers while raising children were also commendable. While the Democrats continue to embrace socialist healthcare policies, the President thoughtfully laid out his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs while maintaining the highest standard of care and access to the most innovative cures. President Trump has kept his promises and America is strong once again. As he made clear in his remarks, there are many opportunities for Congress to help Americans and keep our nation moving forward. I remain committed to working with President Trump, his administration and my colleagues in Congress to continue to grow our 21st century economy and create an environment that ensures opportunity for all.  &nbsp;   Mobile Office Hours Members of my staff will be in Fayetteville and Hamilton on Wednesday, February 12th to meet with constituents and assist anyone experiencing a problem with a federal agency.   &nbsp;  Telephone Town Hall I'm excited to announce I will be hosting my next&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;town&nbsp;hall on February 11th starting at 6:30PM.

I have been hard at work and wanted to update you on my work, both in Washington, DC and back home in Houston.  During the December and January District Work Periods, I was in Washington fulfilling my constitutional duty as part of the ongoing impeachment process against President Donald&nbsp;Trump. In December, we held&nbsp;numerous hearings in the House Judiciary Committee leading up to the impeachment of the President for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.   On January 15th, I was named one of the seven impeachment managers tasked with presenting the people&#8217;s case for removing the President from office before the U.S. Senate and the American people.  Despite having to spend more time in DC because of impeachment, my team and I have participated in many events across the Texas 29th Congressional District, including: Co-Sponsoring a Townhall Action Meeting on Cancer Clusters with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,&nbsp;participating in&nbsp;various School Board Appreciation Month Celebrations, and attending a community breakfast hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).

Legislative Update:  House Democrats and I have been hard at work on behalf of the people of America. Below you can read my legislative update on work taking place on the Judiciary Committee and Financial Services Committees, the two committees that I have the honor of serving on.  Major&nbsp;updates from the House Judiciary Committee:  H.R. 5645: Eyes on the Courts Act of 2020 On January 16th, 2019, Chairman Nadler along with other bipartisan members reintroduced the &#8220;Eyes on the Courts Act.&#8220; This legislation will require cameras be permitted in the Supreme Court and all federal appellate courts. This legislation would provide transparency and allow Americans to have access to court proceedings.  Remain In Mexico Policy Investigation On January 14th, 2019, the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, including myself, launched an investigation into how the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; immigration policy has morphed into a policy where refugees and asylum seekers are being kept in Mexico indefinitely without due process or access to counsel. This investigation will help to ensure the health and safety of asylum seekers at the border.  Major&nbsp;updates from the Financial Services Committee:  H.R. 4302: Homeless Assistance Act of 2019 This bill would allow public housing agencies to share data with local governments and nonprofit service providers, which will help them better identify people who experience homelessness and who need to use multiple services. I supported this bill because I believe it is critical that our social service providers are able to effectively connect residents with resources&nbsp;  H.R. 5315: Expanding Opportunities for MDIs Act This bill would strengthen a U.S. Department of Treasury program to encourage collaboration between Minority Depository Institutions (MDI&#8217;s) and large financial institutions. I am a proud supporter of this bill, as I strongly believe in supporting American small business, especially those that are women and minority-owned.  H.R. 2398: Veteran HOUSE Act of 2020 This bill would expand the eligibility for the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program to veterans experiencing homelessness who have received an other-than-honorable (but not dishonorable) discharge. Supporting our veterans is important to me, and the passage of this bill is one step closer to providing supportive case management and access to resources for those who need it most.&nbsp;  Other major bills in the House of Representatives:  H.R.&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; Lower Drug Costs Now Act This bill would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug manufacturers for lower prices. Insulin is one of the first drugs the secretary must negotiate, and the lower prices will be available to Medicare beneficiaries and those with private insurance. This is an issue that is particularly close to my heart, since seven of my nine&nbsp;siblings are diabetic. This a critical step forward in the fight for affordable healthcare, and it is especially important here in our district where 30% of our district is uninsured according to the US Census Bureau. War Powers Resolution On January 9, 2020, the House of Representatives voted to approve a resolution aimed at restraining the President's ability to use military action against Iran without congressional approval. The resolution states that &#8220; the United States military force, American people and members of the United States Armed Forces deserve a credible explanation regarding the use of military force.&#8221;  Notable News:        Texas Tribune: Garcia got to Congress, and landed in&nbsp;this impeachment role, through quiet competence, resilience amid the rough and tumble nature of Harris County politics&nbsp;and an ability to develop key relationships with friends and rivals alike, according to interviews with over a dozen Texas Democrats.      In District Event Highlights:    Houston Chronicle:&nbsp;Consumer advocate Erin Brockovich to speak on cancer cluster in Fifth Ward at town hall. The town hall, hosted by Jackson Lee and U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Houston), will focus on relief for the community affected by the contamination. Federal, state, county and city representatives, as well as legal experts and environmental and health advocates, are expected to attend. Union Pacific said in a statement that the company will also have a representative present. Concluding Message:  Thank you for taking the time to keep up with the work I&#8217;m doing on your behalf.

Updates from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  On Friday, January 31st, HHS Secretary Alex&nbsp;M. Azar II declared a national public health emergency to aid the country&#8217;s healthcare community in responding to 2019 novel&nbsp;coronavirus&nbsp;(2019-nCoV).&nbsp;American health officials have emphasized that while the virus is a serious public health threat, the risk to the American public remains low at this time. Practicing caution when feeling sick and regularly washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water are still the best recommendations for staying healthy.  Updates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  Federal and local health authorities are monitoring people who have displayed symptoms and have a travel history that puts them at risk. The vast majority of these people have tested negative: In the U.S., there are 11 confirmed cases, 167 people who have a negative test, and two confirmed cases of person-to-person spread.  While person-to-person spread among close contacts has been detected, at this time the virus is NOT currently spreading in the United States. The CDC is still studying the virus to determine how contagious it is. Both cases of person-to-person spread of the virus were between very close contacts, such as family members. &nbsp; U.S. health officials are seeking emergency approval to roll out a test for the coronavirus that can be used by hospitals and state health authorities, instead of having samples shipped to the CDC for analysis.&nbsp;The agency is preparing for scenarios in which the virus spreads widely, although the current risk to the American public remains low. The goal of the ongoing U.S. public health response is to prevent sustained spread of coronavirus in this country.  Updates from the State Department  The State Department has raised their Travel Advisory for China to Level 4: Do Not Travel.&nbsp;Those currently in China should attempt to depart by commercial means. Travelers should be prepared for the possibility of travel restrictions with little or no advance notice. Most commercial air carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China. All flights from China to the United States have been redirected to eleven airports throughout the country, including Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport.  Under the temporary emergency measure, U.S. citizens who have been in Hubei province during the past two weeks will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. Citizens returning from elsewhere in China will be subject to screening and self-quarantine for two weeks while being monitored. Foreign nationals, excluding&nbsp;immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, will be denied entry into the U.S if they have been in China in the past 14 days.  Below is a list of Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts from the CDC:  What You Should Do   Avoid close contact with sick people. While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.&nbsp; Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% alcohol. If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China or were in close contact with someone with coronavirus in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor&#8217;s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.  What You Should Not Do   Do not travel to China. Do not use facemasks. CDC does not recommend the use of facemasks for the&nbsp;general public&nbsp;to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Do not show prejudice to people of Asian descent, because of fear of this new virus. Do not assume that someone of Asian descent is more likely to have coronavirus.  Further Information&nbsp;  Experts have been working hard to understand this new strain of coronavirus. Because new information is coming out every day, please visit the sites below to stay up to date.&nbsp; The CDC&nbsp;provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals.&nbsp; Los Angeles County&nbsp;provides updates on the disease's spread within the County, as well as frequently asked questions for Emergency Responders, and for the public available in&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Spanish,&nbsp;Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. &nbsp;provides a list of travel advisories for those who are planning to fly outside of the United States. The health and safety of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call my Pasadena office at (626) 304-0110.

According to the nonpartisan Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew&nbsp; 2.1% in the 4th quarter of 2019. Since 2016, U.S. annualized GDP growth was more than one percentage point above other countries&#8217; average.&nbsp; Our growth over the last three years also exceeds projections made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in 2016. When you have leadership sending the clear message America is open for business and government gets out of the way of hardworking Americans, our economy will prosper!     _______________  Transportation &#8211; efficiently moving people and things is a critical component of Florida&#8217;s tourism driven economy.&nbsp; Wednesday, House Democrats released an infrastructure framework to invest $750 billion over five years in our roads, bridges, transit systems, railways, airports, ports, inland waterways, brownfields, broadband, and wastewater and drinking water systems. I am encouraged that their framework included many things that are also important to my Republican colleagues and me. Historically, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has worked in a bipartisan manner to develop and pass legislation that prioritizes and invests in our nation&#8217;s infrastructure.&nbsp; If Speaker Pelosi allows Chairman Peter DeFazio to work in this same bipartisan manner, I believe we can develop and pass a comprehensive and responsible infrastructure package that meets our country&#8217;s needs.  _______________  On Wednesday,&nbsp;President Trump fulfilled another campaign promise as he signed the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA).&nbsp;This replaces the outdated NAFTA agreement and lays a solid foundation for the future of North American trade. In Florida, over 8,000 jobs depend on manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico and these two countries accounted for more than $7 billion of Florida's global exports in 2018.&nbsp;Hardworking Floridians will now have a better opportunity to achieve more growth, export more and access more jobs.    _______________  Last week I met with Healthy Families Florida, a nationally recognized family support and coaching program. While Speaker of the House in Florida, I worked to pass the legislation that created Healthy Families Florida and am thrilled to have been a part of bringing it to our state. Healthy Families Florida visits homes and builds on families&#8217; strengths to promote healthy child development and family self-sufficiency. Through individualized parent coaching and support, they provide a comprehensive program to ensure Florida families and youth have the best possible opportunity to thrive and succeed.    _______________  With the start of the 2020 tax season, the IRS has services available to help make filing taxes easier. These services are available at no cost for taxpayers that made $56,000 or less in 2019. More information and location information is available here. Additionally, if you need help with an IRS issue my constituent services team is available to serve you.&nbsp; Please contact my District Office at 352-241-9220 for further assistance.  _______________  Tomorrow night, at 9 PM EST, President Trump will give the annual State of the Union Address.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing his report on the State of the Union and his goals for the rest of the year. &nbsp;His speech will be broadcast live on TV and online.    (President Trump speaking at the 2019 State of the Union)  Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress   Constituent Corner A constituent contacted our office because Social Security was withholding $250.00 from her dependent grandchild's benefit check. Our office sent a congressional inquiry to the local Social Security office followed up, and learned the withholding of the benefits was a mistake and would be corrected. The constituent sent our office a letter stating, &#8220;Thank you so much for your help. I had been trying to do this for almost a year and no one would help me. It's a shame that I lost that 250.00 for approximately 10 months because of their negligence. But thank God you can call your local congressman and get help.&#8221;  Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.&nbsp;  District Update Pam Jones from my local office attended the Lake County Teacher of the Year Banquet, where Christine Palmer of Triangle Elementary School in Mt. Dora was named Lake County Teacher of the Year. Her dedication and influence has impacted countless students and enhanced the educational culture in Lake County. Congratulations to Christine for receiving this high honor!    Legislative Update This week the House passed S. 153, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act. This legislation directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish an interagency working group to coordinate federal programs and policies for transitioning veterans and military spouses into STEM careers. It also directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a plan to increase outreach to veterans. STEM education is essential and getting our veterans involved in these programs is a great way to bring them into the workforce after their service. We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay and helping them join the civilian workforce is one way we can honor them.

Dear Lindsey: AT A GLANCE In this week's Digest, you will find information on: * An update on the Senate impeachment trial; * Announcement of my State of the Union guest ? Isabel Bueso from Concord; and * An amendment to prevent companies from using credit scores to discriminate. IMPEACHMENT UPDATE Last week, the Senate voted to deny witnesses and evidence in the impeachment trial, effectively setting up a vote to acquit the President later this week. The vote was largely along party lines, with only two Republican Senators joining every Democrat in voting to hear from witnesses like former National Security Advisor John Bolton. This week, the Senate will hear closing arguments from the House managers and the President?s attorneys and will vote on whether to find Donald Trump guilty on the articles of impeachment. To hear the Congressman?s thoughts on the Senate?s vote to block witnesses and evidence, and the upcoming vote on whether to find the President guilty and remove him from office, click the video below.  STATE OF THE UNION Tomorrow, February 4th, President Trump will deliver the State of the Union address to the American public. Congressman DeSaulnier?s guest for the event is Isabel Bueso, a recipient of medical deferred action and rare disease advocate. Isabel has been in the country legally for 17 years to participate in a clinical trial and receive life-saving medical care. Last year, Isabel and her family were targeted by the Trump Administration?s cruel immigration policies when they were told they had 33 days to leave the country, a move that would have been a death sentence for Isabel. Isabel?s story is an example of the real-life impacts of President Trump?s cruel immigration policy. Isabel is a courageous advocate and deserves to stay in this country and receive the medical care she needs. To learn more about Isabel?s story and the work the Congressman is doing to help lead her fight, clickHERE  . LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS Mark Joins Colleagues in Reclaiming Congressional War Powers For almost two decades, Presidents have been exploiting a law passed in the wake of 9/11 intended to protect our country, not intended to open unlimited power for the President. That law, known as an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), is long expired. The Constitution gives Congress the explicit right to declare war. We must act to reclaim that power. Mark voted in favor of measures drafted by his colleagues Representatives Barbara Lee and Ro Khanna - one that would repeal the above-mentioned AUMF and one that would stop any federal funds from being used for a war with Iran until Congress votes to authorize that conflict. Our service women and men deserve to have the intensely consequential decision to send them to war to be debated rigorously and restore that decision to Congress, not just one person sitting in the White House. Congressman DeSaulnier Passes an Amendment to Prevent Discrimination in Housing Decisions Credit scores and reports impact many aspects of our lives from determining how much interest we pay on loans to whether we can rent or buy a home. The Comprehensive CREDIT Act (H.R. 3621) will help ensure that consumer rights are protected and improve transparency over credit scores and reporting. Mark successfully included a provision in the bill that will require additional information to be gathered to help prevent companies from using credit scores and reports from discriminating in who they give mortgages to. H.R. 3621 passed with Mark?s support by a vote of 221-to-189. To see Mark speak on this provision, click on the image below.  BY THE NUMBERS Sincerely, Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress ?

In Brooklyn, more intense heat-waves and storms due to climate change are a serious threat to our local power grid, triggering blackouts in many recent years. In the face of this challenge it is imperative that we take steps to protect our communities and make our power sector smarter and more resilient.  Wednesday, January 29, 2020  Subcommittee&nbsp;on Communications and Technology Hearing on Empowering and Connecting Communities through Digital Equity and Internet Adoption   The American people deserve access to broadband devices, the internet and affordable services. Congressman McNerney, Lujan and I recently introduced H.R. 4486, the Digital Equity Act to ensure every person is provided access to the digital literacy they deserve in 2020 and beyond. Information is power and someone&#8217;s income level or neighborhood should have zero impact on their access to broadband internet.  Friday, January 31, 2020&nbsp;  America&#8217;s Bigot-in-Chief has struck again&#8212;this time limiting the rights and banning immigration from certain African countries. President Trump&#8217;s announcement of an African Ban further perpetuates his racist, xenophoic agenda to whitewash America. See tweet here.    IN THE DISTRICT:  &nbsp;  Small businesses are one of the many pillars that make New York&#8217;s 9th Congressional District so unique. Last week's town hall on small businesses was an opportunity that provided information and resources for small businesses in Brooklyn.

See tweet&nbsp;here.    &#8234;Shirley Chisholm first ran for Congress in 1968, and won, going on to serve seven terms as a US Representative.&#8236; As the 1st Black woman to be elected to a Congressional seat, she fiercely advocated for social justice and minority education opportunities. See post here.&nbsp;    Unbought and unbossed (her famous catch phrase), Shirley Chisholm leaves behind a rich legacy, and inspires me every day to work tirelessly as an advocate for our community. Today, and every day, we celebrate the queen, Shirley Chisholm. See tweet&nbsp;here.    Spike Lee is a staple of Brooklyn&#8217;s pop culture, and an icon known across the country. One of my favorite Spike Lee joints, Do the Right Thing, debuted in 1989 and is an incredible portrait of Brooklyn&nbsp;and the values important to our borough.

I hope you enjoyed the big game yesterday. It was an exciting game (and, as a Seahawks fan, I was happy to see the Niners lose). My favorite parts? The Groundhog Day commercial... and the food! I ate far too many chips, far too much dip, and way too many chicken wings. Actually, it was a pretty fun game (and my daughters have convinced me to become a fan of The Masked Singer). Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be heading back to DC, and the first order of business is the State of the Union address. I was asked by someone after my town hall this Saturday what I hoped to hear from President Trump on Tuesday night. There are a lot of differences between the resident&#8217;s priorities and mine. Having said that, most of the folks I represent want the President to work with Democrats and Republicans to solve some problems. In his address, I hope the President outlines some areas where he believes he can work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people. In fact, this morning, I joined a number of my colleagues in asking that President Trump address areas where the American people want folks in D.C. to find common ground and make progress, including:   Improving access to quality, affordable health care. Unfortunately, the Administration has taken steps that have increased premiums and increased the number of uninsured Americans. There are opportunities to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and fix elements of our healthcare system that need fixing. That should be a priority that both parties can get behind.&nbsp; Following through on a commitment to rebuild America&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure. It&#8217;s hard for America to compete in a 21st Century economy with 19th Century infrastructure. There aren&#8217;t Democratic roads or Republican bridges, so this ought to be an area where the two parties and collaborate. Prioritizing a future that works for all Americans. In the midst of disruptive economic change, it&#8217;s important to ensure that American workers are empowered to navigate those changes rather than be victimized by them. Investments in education and training, efforts to increase wages, and strengthening protections for workers can ensure that more people in more places have economic opportunity. Restoring America&#8217;s role in the world. It&#8217;s time to reengage constructively with our allies and restore our role as a leader. That can improve America&#8217;s security and economy.&nbsp; Taking action to build long-lasting solutions to reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy sector will be a core driver of economic growth and job creation. There are a number of common-sense, bipartisan proposals that would represent concrete action to curb carb emissions, spur economic growth and create jobs.  I feel so strongly about the need to make progress on that last priority, I&#8217;m bringing a special guest to the State of the Union: Kitsap County resident Mike Kelly. Mike, a small businessowner who lives with his family on Bainbridge Island, is the Congressional District Liaison in our region for Citizens&#8217; Climate Lobby, a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on policies to combat climate change. I&#8217;ve been working actively to see the United States take action to step up to the climate crisis. Thankfully, I&#8217;m not alone. In fact, folks across our region and across the country are stepping up to raise awareness about the need to act. Mike Kelly, local organizers, and the team at Citizens Climate Lobby are helping to lead the way. I&#8217;m proud to have Mike attend the State of the Union to continue the call for the President to listen to the American people who are not just demanding action - but leadership - to combat climate change and its impacts. We know that if we do this right, we can not only help our planet - we can create quality jobs and sustainable economic growth. You can read all about what Mike&#8217;s attendance means to him in the Kitsap Sun.  There are plenty of policy differences between me and this Administration, but in an era of divided government, progress requires collaboration. I hope we hear that commitment to working together from him tomorrow, too. Now, on to the news&#8230; Taking Action to Keep America Safe  In recent weeks, there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion about rising tensions between the United States and Iran. As I&#8217;ve traveled across our region, I&#8217;ve heard from folks who are deeply concerned about this escalation - and I share those concerns. Ultimately, the American people do not want - and Congress has not authorized - another war in the Middle East. Our servicemembers and diplomats who serve there, including the ones I visited in Iraq this past November, deserve a strategy that keeps them safe, enhances our security, and fosters long term stability in the region.  Last week, Congress passed two bills I co-sponsored to reclaim the Constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and authorize the use of military force, an authority that has eroded over the last two decades. You can hear more about that here:    Ensuring Future Generations Never Forget  Every year on Holocaust Memorial Day, we honor the millions of innocent people who lost their lives. Families across the world have their own stories of this dark chapter in our world&#8217;s history.  This year on Holocaust Memorial Day, which coincided this year with the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the House passed the &#8220;Never Again Education Act&#8221; - bipartisan legislation I supported to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America so future generations can continue to learn these stories. This bill will provide fundamental resources, education, and training for teachers and students across the country to ensure we continue to educate our communities and future generations on the lessons of the Holocaust - and ultimately promote the importance of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people.  Continuing the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic  Across our country, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have been one of the leading causes of drug overdoses and fatalities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 41% of the 70,200 drug overdoses in the United States in 2017 were caused by fentanyl and illicit chemical copycats of the drug, which is 100 times more potent than morphine. And in 2018, there were over 30,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths alone. In response, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2018 placed a temporary emergency order to classify all fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 drugs (meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use). This temporary order increased restrictions in terms of access, manufacturing, and use - and has led to the supply of new fentanyl analogues dropping by 75 percent.  Last week, the House took bipartisan action to extend the temporary order on these drugs for 15 more months, overwhelmingly passing the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report within 12 months on the public health and safety effects of controlling fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1. While its only a temporary solution, it&#8217;s a start. I&#8217;m hopeful that Congress will continue to work to develop common-sense, long-term solutions to the opioid crisis.&nbsp;  Working for You  Honoring Our Veterans  Want to be inspired?!? Listen to this story... I recently held a Vietnam Veterans pinning ceremony in Tacoma to say thank you to Vietnam-era vets on behalf of a grateful nation. About halfway through the event, we got a call that a group of veterans was on its way from the Retsil Veterans&#8217; Home in Kitsap County but that they would be an hour late. Having already pinned everyone in attendance, I made an announcement that more vets were on the way, and I asked if folks would be willing to stick around to thank the folks who were coming from Retsil. I was so moved that every single person stuck around. One veteran said to me, &#8220;You know, a lot of us have waited forty or fifty years to get thanked. I can wait a few minutes to honor these folks coming from Retsil.&#8221;&nbsp;  WOW! It was a real testament to the awesome character of our community - and of the veterans who have served our country. I&#8217;m grateful for everyone that came out for this special event.   Celebrating Team Kitsap  The economic forecast for Kitsap County is bright thanks to the presence of the incredible employers, innovative educational partners, and the economic development A-Team that is the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance. It was great to join them to talk about opportunities for the future. Count me as a proud member of Team Kitsap!    Supporting Washington&#8217;s Ocean Economy  I&#8217;m committed to supporting Washington&#8217;s ocean economy. I enjoyed the opportunity to be in Grays Harbor to hear from members of the fishing community and discuss a new bill I introduced to improve the federal fishery disaster process and ensure more timely disaster relief for impacted communities. I&#8217;m also working as a member of the Appropriations Committee to restore our salmon populations.    Helping Our Seniors  Seniors today are facing unique challenges. That&#8217;s why I was grateful for the opportunity to hold a seniors town hall at the Willows Retirement Living in Bremerton to hear from folks and to talk about the work I&#8217;m doing to ensure Congress protects Medicare &amp; Social Security, lowers the cost of prescription drug prices, and keeps our nation&#8217;s promise to take care of older Americans.    Hearing from You at Town Halls  Speaking of town halls... I held a town hall in Suquamish on Saturday where we talked about opportunities to reduce student debt and ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.&nbsp;  Couldn&#8217;t come? Join me February 10th at 5:30pm PT for a Facebook Live Town Hall. It&#8217;s always important for me to be available, accessible, and accountable to you.  OK - that&#8217;s it for now folks. As always, I&#8217;m honored to represent you.

It was great being back in the 11th District last week, where I traveled throughout communities and heard directly from folks at home about what we should be tackling in Congress. Hearing directly from my constituents about the issues facing the community helps me get it right in Washington.  This week, I had the opportunity to visit and walk through our local Lancaster county Home Depot. I appreciate Kyle teaching me about their paint department. Keep up the great work, Kyle!   Here is a fun video of my visit&#8230;  Click Here    During the district week, I had the opportunity to present Elizabeth Silbaugh Johnides, a constituent from Hanover, PA, with a copy of the Congressional Record which included my remarks about her outstanding service to the community in Hanover. To see my speak about her accomplishments on the House floor, click here.  I also had the opportunity to visit the Guthrie Memorial Library in Hanover with the new Mayor of Hanover SueAnn Whitman. At the library, I read a book to children about the importance of voting.&nbsp;   I toured the Elsner Engineering Works, a manufacturer of machines and equipment in Hanover, PA.   I finished the week at the PA Career Link Facility in York County to discuss the work they are doing to help veterans and individuals reenter the workforce.   Here is a video of my week in the district...  Click Here    The USMCA Is Signed Into Law!  On Wednesday, President Trump delivered on his promise to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA) and signed into law the much-awaited United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement.&nbsp;  &nbsp;The USMCA delivers on the promise President Trump made to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This deal marks a tremendous victory for Pennsylvania workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses. It has the potential to create nearly 600,000 jobs and generate up to $235 billion in economic activity.&#8221;   In Pennsylvania, trade with Canada and Mexico is essential. Over 42,000 jobs depend upon manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico. The USMCA will provide businesses across the Commonwealth with new opportunities and will create new jobs with family-sustaining wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The signing of the USMCA into law means expanding and opening new market access for our Pennsylvania dairy, egg and poultry producers. New markets are welcome news for the nearly 7,000 family-owned and operated farms in PA-11. Our farmers in York and Lancaster Counties, who are national leaders in the production of milk and eggs, have only asked for a level playing field which to compete.   This modern trade deal brings our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico into the 21st century, protecting American intellectual property and ensuring strong, effective protections for innovators and creators. I congratulate the President for delivering on his promise, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to implement policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our nation.   The President and Vice President gave outstanding remarks at the signing of the bill, for those who may have not been able to watch, here is a link to watch the full bill signing.&nbsp;  Click Here     March For Life  On Friday, thousands of people from across America came to our nation&#8217;s capital to March for Life. I applaud President Trump for making history as becoming the first sitting president to attend the march. In his remarks, he reaffirmed his commitment to implementing pro-life and pro-family policies. Since 2017, the Trump Administration has established more conscience protections than ever before. While progress has been made, there is still more to accomplish.&nbsp;  It is always heartening to see so many young adults, families, and college groups come to peacefully demonstrate for the rights of the unborn. The fight to protect life from conception is one that involves all of us.&nbsp; Click below to hear my remarks on the House floor about March For Life and also videos from the rally!&nbsp;  Click Here    Click Here    Click Here    WDAC Weekly Radio Appearance  Click Here     #NeverAgain  January 28th, 2020 marked the 75th year since the liberation of over 7,000 prisoners from the German Nazi Auschwitz camp. For nearly five years, these resilient individuals, including 700 children, saw their loved-ones murdered while they endured humiliation, suffering, and pain. &nbsp;I cosponsored and voted in favor of the bipartisan Never Again Education Act (H.R. 943), which authorizes funding to be used to develop and nationally disseminate resources to promote understanding about how and why the Holocaust happened. The education materials will be developed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.   For more information on the Never Again Education Act click here.

Click Here     Democrats&#8217; Dangerous Attempt To Repeal The AUMF  This week I voted against the House Democrats&#8217; dangerous attempts to tie the hands of the Commander &#8211; in &#8211; Chief by repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).&nbsp;At a time when Congress should be&nbsp;projecting unity in the face of Iranian aggression, House Democrats&nbsp;have advanced a dangerous resolution that ultimately will accomplish nothing but division.&nbsp;By&nbsp;taking legal and necessary options off the table for the executive branch, this&nbsp;amendment&nbsp;emboldens our enemies and&nbsp;makes&nbsp;our nation less safe.&nbsp;The safety and security of the American people at home and abroad should be the central focus of our foreign policy. I strongly oppose this legislation. We must keep Americans safe.&nbsp;To read my full statement on this legislation, click here.   York County District Attorney&#8217;s Visits Washington  It was great to have York County District Attorney, Dave Sunday, in the office this week. He was in town for the National District Attorney Association 2020 Capital Conference. We discussed important criminal justice issues facing York County.&nbsp;I appreciate his office&#8217;s efforts to keep our community safe and look forward to continuing our discussion.     Honoring Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick  This week, Congress honored the life and service of Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick who lost his battle with cancer. He was a fierce advocate for Pennsylvania&#8217;s 8th district and he will be missed.  Click to Watch     Here&#8217;s Lloyd  Since I&#8217;ve taken office, I&#8217;ve held nearly 300 meetings with constituents and nearly 200 visits all across our district&nbsp;including&nbsp;schools, non-profit organizations and small businesses.

The BLM Works for the West When it comes to managing our state&#8217;s treasured lands, it&#8217;s time for a little less D.C. influence and a little more Colorado common sense. As a fifth-generation Coloradan, I believe in Colorado and Grand Junction and&nbsp;I believe we are up to the task of being home to the BLM Headquarters. The great outdoors are part of who we are as Coloradans. We champion groundbreaking research into new alternative energy methods and technology to improve the environment, and we take immense pride that people from all over the world come to Colorado to enjoy our state&#8217;s beauty. Read my op-ed in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel on why Grand Junction is the perfect location for the BLM&#8217;s headquarters. Remembering the Horrors of the Holocaust   Seventy-five years ago this week, liberation arrived at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day we remembered the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jewish people who were murdered.  Wuhan Coronavirus Update Upon learning of the coronavirus outbreak in China, I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to ensure Congress is prepared to serve as a collaborative partner in a successful response. At my urging, the U. S.

Congratulations to a Senate Page from Colorado Springs  Join me in congratulating Jennifer St. George from Colorado Springs on finishing the United States Senate Page Program! Jennifer represented Colorado as a Senate Page and I wish her the best in her future endeavors. High school students interested in applying to the U.S. Senate Page Program can find more information on my website. This program provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn about Congress while living, working, and attending classes for a semester in Washington, D.C.  Colorado Unemployment Rate Hits Historic Low Colorado&#8217;s unemployment rate reached a historic low as pro-growth policies are delivering for workers. In December, Colorado&#8217;s unemployment rate dipped to 2.5 percent, the lowest in more than 40 years and 1 percent lower than the national average. According to Ryan Gedney, a senior economist with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, &#8220;we&#8217;re seeing people find jobs that are a great fit for them and also we&#8217;re seeing really strong wage gains.&#8221; I&#8217;m proud of the great economic success we have achieved in Colorado, and I&#8217;ll continue to fight for policies that allow every corner of Colorado to grow and thrive. Firefighter with Colorado Ties Killed in Australia Wildfires  I&#8217;m saddened to hear of the loss of firefighter Ian McBeth, a graduate of Wray High School Class of &#8217;94, who was killed while volunteering in Australia fighting the wildfires.

China Jails Student for Exercising Basic Freedoms China&#8217;s vision for a less free and open world has reached our shores. The Chinese Communist Party has now imprisoned a University of Minnesota student for practicing the most basic freedoms we cherish in the United States.

COMBATTING THE DRUG CRISIS  This week, it was my privilege to join the U.S. Drug Czar, ONDCP Director Jim Carroll, at the White House for the launch of the Rural Community Action Guide - a new initiative to address drug abuse and addiction in rural communities. This is a huge step forward as we work together to combat the drug crisis and save lives.&nbsp;   &nbsp; ***DOWN IN WASHINGTON&nbsp;  On Monday, I recognized&nbsp;Specialist Joseph Raymond of East Berlin, PA for his outstanding achievement during the Solider of the Year board for the 1st Battalion, 108th Field Artillery. Watch my remarks HERE.&nbsp;    ***  This week, President Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. This trade deal&nbsp;will deliver fairer trade opportunities, create jobs, and strengthen our economy - a big win for PA-13 and for our nation.&nbsp;   ***In PA-13 and across the country, fentanyl has claimed too many lives and devastated too many families. On Wednesday, the House passed lifesaving legislation to prevent fentanyl from killing our neighbors. Watch my remarks in support of this legislation HERE.&nbsp;&nbsp;    ***  BACK HOME IN PA-13  &nbsp;In Somerset on Thursday, I met with&nbsp;Executive Director of the Somerset County of Chamber of Commerce Ron Aldom and Bill Arnold, Executive Director of the Quecreek Mine Rescue Foundation, to discuss the legacy of the eleven miners rescued in 2002. Nearly 18 years later, we continue to honor these brave men and those who helped to rescue them.  ***  On Friday, I had a great meeting with Robin Fitzpatrick, President of the Adams Economic Alliance, as we discussed workforce development and economic growth in Adams County.   ***  In Adams County, I also met with the hardworking team at New Oxford Fire Department. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I work alongside local, state, and federal partners to help American communities prepare for any emergency they may face. It is important for our first responders to be adequately equipped to safely protect the people of PA-13.&nbsp;    ***  ONE MORE THING&nbsp;  Over the past three years, 7.3 million jobs have been created in the United States, including more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs. Thanks to our incredible skilled workforce, PA-13 is one of the nation's leaders in heavy equipment manufacturing. Alongside President Trump, I will continue working to support a pro-growth, pro-American worker agenda to deliver results for PA-13 and our nation.&nbsp;    ***  Thank you for taking the time to learn about what I was working on this week and I look forward to updating you again next Sunday.

Trump, effectively condoning the President&#8217;s crimes and&nbsp;the railroading of our Constitution. I believe, and the majority of America knows, that&nbsp;this President can&#8217;t be legitimately acquitted because he never underwent a real trial.  The sham trial began ominously when Senator Mitch McConnell, in the dead of night, pushed&nbsp;through a set of trial rules without guarantees for key witnesses or documents and despite the Trump Administration&#8217;s blatant obstruction of Congress and the American people from hearing all the facts of the case. Nevertheless, the House managers presented a powerful case, proving to the American people that the President must be removed from office for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. As the President&#8217;s defense team presented its arguments, a shocking development heightened the urgent need for witness testimony and documents to be turned over to Congress that this&nbsp;Administration refused&nbsp;to provide. Friday night's vote by Republican Senators not to call witnesses and provide the public with a complete and unvarnished accounting of the President's scheme to bribe Ukraine with millions of dollars of badly needed military funding and equipment -- funds&nbsp;already approved by&nbsp;Congress -- in&nbsp;exchange for dirt on his political&nbsp;rival makes them complicit in&nbsp;the President's&nbsp;scheme.&nbsp;Without witnesses or evidence this is not a trial, it's a travesty.  Republicans in the House and Senate&nbsp;who have willingly gone&nbsp;along with&nbsp;the President's&nbsp;defense that anything he does, no matter how criminal or corrupt, is unimpeachable if he says it's in the public's interest has placed&nbsp;our entire system of government, the rule of law, and our Constitution in great peril. This is a moment in history that revealed&nbsp;those who&nbsp;had the courage and conviction to uphold their duty, and those who cared more about advancing the power of their party and hanging onto their seats.  Despite this historic low point, the Democratically controlled House continued with critical&nbsp;legislative business to benefit hardworking Americans and their families.&nbsp;I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to make it easier for military survivors to report sexual assaults. I also led a letter with 49 of my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women. Though the examples are numerous, the letter was prompted&nbsp;in light of his most recent comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing \"a good job\" on a reporter that Pompeo&nbsp;verbally attacked simply&nbsp;because she did her job.

On Friday, The New York Times reported that Bolton's manuscript contains details of the President directing Bolton to help with the President's pressure campaign&nbsp;on&nbsp;Ukraine, which dangled the promise of a White House meeting and critically needed&nbsp;funding for the fledgling democracy&nbsp;in exchange for a hit job&nbsp;on Trump&#8217;s political rival. The article states,&nbsp;&#8220;Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president&#8217;s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president&#8217;s impeachment defense.&#8221; That gun isn&#8217;t just smoking, the barrel is&nbsp;red hot and the trigger is covered with the President's grubby fingerprints. The Senate trial heads into its final&nbsp;conclusion&nbsp;next week following&nbsp;Senate Republicans vote&nbsp;Friday night against calling fact witnesses or requiring a shred of documentary evidence to be presented. Rest assured that&nbsp;my Democratic colleagues in the House and I will continue to fight the President's and Republicans' attempts to consolidate power in the Executive Branch and their cover-up&nbsp;of his crimes&nbsp;and corruption. America needs and demands the truth; we will not rest until all the facts are unearthed for the public's view and benefit.  Introduced Legislation to Make it Safe for Military Survivors to Report Assault On Thursday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague, Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE), to make it easier for sexual assault survivors across the military to report their assailants. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) expect to introduce companion legislation in the United States soon. Too many sexual assault survivors in our military and academies hesitate to report attacks because they fear they be punished for minor infractions&#8212;such as underage drinking or curfew violations&#8212;that may be uncovered during the assault investigation. Getting survivors to report these incidents so that they can access services and perpetrators can be held accountable is should be the focus of military leadership, not punishment of victims for minor misconduct. Our bill will ensure survivors cannot be punished for minor issues when they report an assault, unless aggravating circumstances exist. The Air Force Academy has already tested this program and seen positive results. Survivors and their loved ones should know that will fight hard to pass this legislation in this year&#8217;s National Defense Authorization Act, and that they are not alone.  Sent Letter to the President Condemning his Continuing Degradation of Women a letter to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women. The letter was sent on the heels of Secretary Pompeo disparaging NPR&#8217;s Mary Louise Kelly, a well-renowned journalist, for doing her job when she asked Pompeo about Ukraine. Kelly said that Pompeo shouted and swore at her and demanded she find the country on an unmarked map, which she did with no trouble. Pompeo then barred the reporter from covering his upcoming trip to Europe. The next day, President Trump validated this misogynistic and autocratic behavior by stating, &#8220;you did a good job on her.&#8221; Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, an esteemed career diplomat committed to anti-corruption reforms who the President referred to as &#8220;the woman&#8221; who is &#8220;going to go through some things&#8221; in the infamous July 25 call with President Zelensky, was yet another casualty. It is most shameful that the words young girls and boys hear directed at women from the upper echelons of power are dripping with disdain and disrespect. It is as if this President relishes the opportunity to publicly humiliate any woman who fights back, speaks up, or takes up space. As the women of the DWC admonished him in our letter, the President of the United States should set a moral example for our children, not be the biggest bully on the playground.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Asked Defense Department About Remedial Action for Whistleblower Retaliation At a hearing this week of the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, we heard from a panel of government officials and experts on the need for stronger whistleblower protections in our laws. As Co-Chair of the House&#8217;s Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I have long advocated for whistleblower protection laws and have secured crucial legislative victories advancing rights to intelligence and congressional whistleblowers.  Much of the hearing focused on the huge backlog of 2,500 cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has been unable to function for over a year because President Trump and Senator McConnell have failed to fill seats on the board for quorum. I asked Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, why there possibly could be cases of illegal reprisals against whistleblowers that are substantiated during inspector general investigations and yet never result in compensation for the whistleblower. Fine agreed with me that there is a &#8220;disturbing&#8221; trend of defense agencies essentially ignoring inspector general recommendations to make whistleblowers whole, and that Congress must continue to put pressure and legislate to protect whistleblowers.  Armed Services Committee Hearing on Security of the Korean Peninsula On Tuesday, I pressed representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Intelligence Agency at the House Armed Services Committee&#8217;s hearing on the lack of a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea. The President gave Kim Jong-un multiple PR victories, praising him, meeting with him, and becoming the first U.S. President to set foot in North Korea, raising their global recognition and validating a regime never before recognized by Democratic or Republican Administrations. None of these displays got us any closer to containing the North Korean threat. Now, the Administration claims it&#8217;s applying a &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; campaign. However, it&#8217;s also pressuring and disrespecting our allies in South Korea and Japan, demanding outrageous increases to the billions of dollars our allies already contribute annually to our mutual defense. The President&#8217;s handling of the security region is erratic and dangerous. We must continue to demand a coherent strategy for dealing with our adversaries and hold this Administration&#8217;s feet to the fire for the safety and security of the region and our country.  Oversight Committee Hearing on &#8220;75 Years After the Holocaust: The Ongoing Battle Against Hate&#8221; Tuesday, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Additional hearings will be held in the coming weeks on voter suppression in minority communities, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim discrimination, anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions, and challenges facing LGBTQ individuals. As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I&#8217;ll also preside at a hearing next month on the dangers of white supremacist elements in our military.  Discussion on Poverty in the 21st Century and its Impact on Women As Co-Chair of the Democratic Women&#8217;s Caucus, I participated in a discussion on modern day poverty and its disproportionate impact on women. We heard from experts who explained the shocking reality that more people die of poverty in America than heart attacks and cancer combined. For millions of Americans, every day is a struggle to avoid eviction, put food on the table, or pay for just one doctor&#8217;s visit. Beyond these challenges, many women also take on the dual responsibilities of a traditional job and home and child care. This &#8220;social production&#8221; work constitutes a second job, but it&#8217;s not adequately valued in our society. In a particularly heart-breaking moment, I listened as one mother recounted her daughter&#8217;s struggle with cancer. Like many Americans struggling with inadequate health care, her daughter went to an emergency room after discovering a lump in her breast and was turned away without any additional care or tests due to her lack of health insurance. After months of no medical care, severe pains forced her back to the ER. The untreated cancer had spread through her entire body and caused her breast to completely rot off. As the wealthiest country in the world, it is a choice &#8211; not a forced reality &#8211; to not invest in affordable health care for every American. Indeed, the mother&#8217;s home state of Alabama opted out of the Medicaid expansion. No mother should have to watch her daughter die before her eyes knowing it was avoidable. Doubling rates of homelessness, hospital closures to make way for real estate development, and a complete lack of affordable dental care rounded out the discussion and further underscored the inhumane inequality growing in our country. We must remember that our nation&#8217;s successes cannot be fairly measured without considering everyone that has been left behind.    Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives from CalPERS  I am proud of all of California&#8217;s public employees and pleased that their retirement is in the hands of the trustworthy and forward-thinking managers at CalPERS.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District  Here are some issues they raised this week: &#8226; 96 constituents expressed their concern for the climate crisis. We must take bold action to combat climate change, end our addiction to fossil fuels, and grow our green economy. How we address climate change now will be the defining moment of this century. You have my word that I will be a vigorous advocate for bold action to solve this crisis so that we can leave a healthier planet for future generations. &#8226; 60 constituents shared their support for our public lands. For years, Republicans in Congress have waged a war against our public lands, introducing dangerous bills that threaten public land ownership and benefit special interest groups and corporate polluters at the expense of our environment. I have consistently voted against legislation that would allow state governments to sell or exploit public lands for profit and I have fought efforts to scale back protections under the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other critical environmental safeguards. &#8226; 22 constituents expressed their support for increased consumer safety regulations. As an avid proponent of consumer protection, I recognize the importance of improved labeling and consumer education campaigns and have introduced legislation to combat risks ranging from lead-filled children&#8217;s glasses to poisonous detergent pods. I am currently working on a bill to address the extensive contamination of PFAS, or forever chemicals, in cosmetics and personal care products.

Quick Links I&nbsp;attended the White House signing ceremony led by President Trump for the&nbsp;United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act. This trade deal means thousands of new jobs and a level playing field for U.S. farmers and manufacturers. It also creates strong protections and opportunities for American workers and innovators. The ratification of USMCA demonstrates President Trump&#8217;s credibility on trade and strengthens our hand when negotiating further trade agreements with countries like China.&nbsp;Photos from the signing ceremony can be found here and here,&nbsp;and my tweet can be found here. You can also read my recent op-ed on the importance of USMCA and having strong trading partners around the world here.&nbsp;  I'm proud to sponsor Sen. Ernst's bill, the&nbsp;Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act, which was voted unanimously out of the Senate Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs.&nbsp;Our nation&#8217;s veterans served their country and it&#8217;s our responsibility to take care of them when they come home. Veterans and their families should have confidence in their VA health care providers. This bill&nbsp;requires that every health care provider hired by the VA with a revoked license undergoes a third party review of that provider&#8217;s care. If the review determines that a competent practitioner would have managed the veteran&#8217;s care differently, the veteran will be notified. I&#8217;m proud to work with Sen. Ernst as she leads the fight for better care for our veterans.  I recently joined my colleagues&nbsp;to introduce a bipartisan resolution to bring awareness to human trafficking. The resolution shows support for National Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention Month.&nbsp;Human trafficking and exploitation has no place in our society. Sadly though, it still occurs in communities all across our country, including Iowa. Bringing greater awareness to this form of modern-day slavery is critical to facing it head on and restoring the dignity and addressing the trauma of those impacted.

Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, it&#8217;s easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t make progress by standing on the sidelines.&#8221; After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, we&#8217;re not surrendering. In fact, just the opposite: We&#8217;re fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect. It&#8217;s an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives. Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community. I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities. Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you. Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke     &nbsp;    Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents. Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve. Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market. These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home. In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments. The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers. Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings. I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act. This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex. My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes. New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.  &nbsp;     In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the President&#8217;s anti-immigrant agenda. My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R. 6) passed in the House of Representatives last year. According to H.R. 6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America. Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge.   Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the President&#8217;s xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, I&#8217;m committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census. It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community. We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive. Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts. Every person counts.        Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States. I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people. As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests.        Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities. Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R. 4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R. 4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on America&#8217;s national security.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residents&#8212;many in the Ninth District&#8212;were left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared. I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesn&#8217;t happen again. Brooklyn&#8217;s communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century. To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn. With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities. As a firm believer in Congress&#8217; ability to come together and combat this nation&#8217;s contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation.     I am proud that my bill H.R. 5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as &#8220;the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn.&#8221; My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy. Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007. At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing. Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all. In Major Owens&#8217; honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives.        My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell. This inaction is unacceptable. The fact is: background checks save lives. Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns. Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R. 1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm. From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence.        I&#8217;m proud that my bill, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act,&#8221; passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls. If you&#8217;ve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers. These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills. I know robocalls are more than annoying&#8212;they&#8217;re costly. My legislation, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act.&#8221; will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.        Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you. Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents. That&#8217;s why I take every opportunity to celebrate the community, whether it&#8217;s dancing with my friends and constituents at the yearly West Indian Day Parade or eating food from local restaurants and vendors at street fairs, such as the Park Slope 5th Avenue Street Fair.

It was an honor to join President Trump at the signing ceremony for this historic trade agreement on behalf of the farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers who rely on a strong trade relationship with our neighbors to the north and south. The signing of this agreement signifies President Trump's kept promise to the American people: bringing NAFTA into the 21st Century and finally negotiating an agreement that benefits the United States, creates jobs, and expands access for our high-quality goods and services.&nbsp;  Learn more about how the USMCA will benefit Central Washington.    Time to Modernize in ESA   The Endangered Species Act was signed into law 47 years ago with the worthy goal of protecting and revitalizing endangered and threatened animals and wildlife. Unfortunately, the outdated law has proved to be a staggering failure for the species it was intended to aid, with only a 3% recovery rate.&nbsp;    Click here to watch my remarks on the House floor.  I hosted a Special Order with my colleagues of the Western Caucus to discuss our ongoing effort to strengthen and modernize the Endangered Species Act by creating a comprehensive approach to advance species recovery. By using the best available science, considering all conservation measures, streamlining processes for listing decisions, and empowering state and local efforts to contribute to species recovery, we can fulfill the true intent of the ESA.

The Moore's have opened their hearts and their home to several foster children in the Yakima Valley, recently finalizing the adoption of their daughter and welcoming a 2-year-old foster son. Thank you, Jake and Angie, for all you do to advocate for foster care and adoption and for becoming a family for these children who need a home.&nbsp;  Promoting Services for Domestic Violence Survivors  Did you know the Yakima Police Department responds to 10-12 domestic violence cases per day? I toured the YWCA Yakima to learn about the programs and services they offer victims of domestic violence throughout the Yakima Valley. From the emergency shelter and housing services to prevention and outreach, the staff at the YWCA is working to curb this terrifying statistic and provide support for families in need.&nbsp; The Next Generation  Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting Mr. Fickel's exceptional 6th grade class at Harrison Middle School in Sunnyside - my old stomping grounds! I had the opportunity to speak with students about my role as their Representative in Congress, and I was impressed by their thoughtful questions about civics and current events. It's important to teach the next generation about our government in order to have an informed public, and I am proud to be a part of that.&nbsp;  To stay current on the work I am doing around the District and in Washington D.C., I encourage you to follow me&nbsp; on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and to read updates&nbsp;on my&nbsp;website.&nbsp; It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.

We will get to that America.&#8221; More than two decades later, I am still hopeful for an America where housing is treated as a human right.  This week, I joined my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus to launch a groundbreaking initiative to address the housing crisis and make housing a human right. I also continued to fight against the xenophobic Muslim Ban and challenged an outdated and dangerous law that gives the executive branch extreme power to target our immigrant communities. Last week I was home in Minneapolis hosting events on the housing and opioid crises our communities are facing in the 5th and around the country.&nbsp;  Despite the many systemic challenges we are facing in the district and around the country, I know that the struggles of today will bring us closer to the America of our dreams.  Thank you for being an engaged constituent. I look forward to hearing from you!  In service,    Ilhan Omar Member of Congress    UPCOMING EVENTS Join us for a Community Conversation with Congresswoman Omar on Combating Hate on Thursday, February 20 from 6:30-8:00 PM CST. RSVP on Eventbrite using this link.&nbsp; For all updates and upcoming events visit our website here. All events are free and open to the public.    Back in the District School Visit Being home means that I can do what I love most: visiting local schools, like Sandburg Middle School. I am always inspired by listening to our youth&#8217;s visions for a future where everyone is able to be their full self. You're never too young to engage in our democracy! Opioid Roundtable I hosted a vital discussion with the Cedar-Riverside community on the opioid crisis. Addressing this pressing problem requires a public health approach, which means we should not be criminalizing those struggling with addiction. I was grateful for the community wisdom on how we can heal our communities together. Town Hall I was joined by some of my brilliant partners in the district working to ensure that everyone in this country is granted their basic human right to safe and affordable housing. Guaranteeing Homes for All is a core part of addressing the climate crisis and preventing displacement, and we need bold policies to address the scale of the crisis we face. &nbsp;    No Ban Act On the third anniversary of the hateful Muslim Ban, I joined colleagues from the House and Senate to remind the President that we will not tolerate religious bigotry in this country. Here in the United States, the values that unite us are upholding civil liberties and ensuring basic human rights for all. We must remember that the fight to place the Muslim Ban in the dustbin of history does not end with its repeal. The stains of this policy and others like it will remain if we don&#8217;t collectively work to change hearts and minds so that we can truly treat each other as neighbors. &nbsp;   The People's Housing Platform This week, along with other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and housing justice advocates, we launched the People&#8217;s Housing Platform, which includes my Homes For All legislation. This groundbreaking, progressive housing framework declares what we know to be true: housing is a fundamental human right, and it is inextricably tied to the struggles for climate and racial justice. &nbsp;    Neighbors Not Enemies Act I also introduced the Neighbors Not Enemies Act, which fully repeals the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This outdated and dangerous law permits the President extreme executive powers to target an entire group of foreign nationals.  It is an offense to our values as a nation, which should stand as a refuge for those fleeing violence and persecution and is a perfect example of outdated immigration laws that are being exploited and abused by this Administration. As the President seeks to expand the Muslim Ban, we must close policy loopholes that he can exploit to cause harm to our neighbors, our country and the values that we hold dear.       &nbsp;  Stay Updated with the Office of Representative Ilhan Omar   Please do not respond to this e-mail.&nbsp;Contact the Office  &nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSCRIBE SERVICES  Unsubscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp; Privacy            ","district":"5","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"MN","party":"Democrat","score":2.7813725},{"name":"Representative Sean Patrick Maloney","address":"NY18SMIMA@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-01-31","subject":"  INVITE!","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }       News from Congressman Maloney                          Home About Member About District News Contact                     Lindsey Cormack,  &nbsp;  I&#8217;m holding town halls in Bedford,&nbsp;Putnam Valley,&nbsp;Poughkeepsie, and New Windsor this weekend, and I want to hear from you!

Inhofe, US Senator for Oklahoma * INHOFE INFORMANT: Fighting for Life * * * In case you missed it, hundreds of pro-life Oklahomans joined tens of thousands of Americans to march for life last week. I was proud to stand with these marchers not only last week, but this week and every week. Read my entire op-ed on why we must continue to fight for life in the Oklahoman here [link 1] and below. [image = Inhofe in the Oklahoman: The war on the unborn: We must keep fighting* * If you watch the liberal news media today, you would think no one is advocating for the unborn or standing up for the right to life. Thank goodness the media has it wrong. Support in the United States for the pro-life position is strong. A recent Gallup poll showed 50% of Americans consider abortion morally wrong. For the first time since 2013, more Americans are pro-life (49%), rather than pro-abortion (46%). Other polling has found that the majority of Americans don't support taxpayer-funded abortion. By highlighting the value of all human life, we're making progress to end the abortion on demand culture. But the fight isn't nearly over. Liberal states are continuing to push for more and more extreme abortion laws. New York and Vermont have enacted laws that will allow abortion up to the moment of birth. Illinois passed a law making abortion a \"fundamental right\" and explicitly stating that unborn children do not have rights. It's heinous. The abortion-on-demand industry has no respect for the dignity of human life. Last year, authorities discovered more than 2,000 aborted fetal remains in the home of a deceased abortion doctor from Indiana. The evidence is clear: We must fight every day so abortion doesn't claim any more unborn babies. When you are pro-life, you believe every life is a gift from God that begins at conception -- no matter what. That means you believe in the value and future potential of every child. Sadly, not everyone sees that. Case in point: Over two-thirds of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted in the United States. I introduced legislation to prohibit abortion based on a Down syndrome diagnosis. I also have cosponsored several key pro-life bills, including the Life at Conception Act, which recognizes that life begins at conception, and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization. On top of efforts in Congress, we have the most pro-life president in history. We have worked together to guarantee that federal tax dollars can't go toward abortion by protecting the Hyde Amendment and reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy. We have also stripped abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, of using federal Title X funding for abortions. And we're not done. Just this month, I joined more than 200 of my colleagues in urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade. This would be a huge win for life. But, as we see with New York, Vermont and other states, when we make progress in Washington by standing for life, liberal states try to roll back those protections. That's why the work of Oklahomans for Life and events like Rose Day at the state Capitol are so important. Oklahoma is also consistently ranked as one of the top ten states most protective of life. This week alone, hundreds of pro-life Oklahomans will join tens of thousands of Americans who are marching for life. I'm proud to stand with these marchers this week and every week. We know that as we keep fighting for what is right, we will not be overcome. Rather, we will overcome evil with good by upholding and affirming the dignity and inherent worth of every human being. We will keep fighting. *Inhofe, R-Tulsa, is Oklahoma's senior U.S. senator.* I was glad to have so many of the Oklahomans marching for life stop by my office so we could talk about our shared values. *View some of the photos from their visit below:* [image = [image = [image = [image = ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] Office Locations: Washington, DC Office: 205 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 -3603 Main: (202) 224-4721 Fax: (202) 228-0380 Tulsa, OK Office: 1924 S.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act (), the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act (), the Never Again Education Act (), the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act (), the Global Hope Act (), a Resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests (), the Keeping Girls in School Act (), the Tibetan Policy Support Act (), the Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act (), the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act (), an Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the No War With Iran Act (), and an additional Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the Repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF ().  It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!&nbsp; This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month. David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead. They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation. Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .            Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico &#8211; two of Arkansas&#8217;s top trading partners. The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity.  For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs.  The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this week&#8217;s signing delivers a 21st&nbsp;century trade framework. This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural State&#8217;s world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansas&#8217;s hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families. Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansas&#8217;s exports. A&nbsp;&nbsp;from the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million. Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand. It&#8217;s exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December. By negotiating from strength &#8211; the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy. This landmark agreement puts America first! I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line. Promises made, promises kept! The President also announced his . The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people. With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East. No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone &#8211; and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation. On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future. Centuries of hostilities won&#8217;t be solved overnight &#8211; but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path. I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region.  It&#8217;s noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda. While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America. The results speak for themselves &#8211; thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created. &nbsp;In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations. We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory. Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year. On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic.  It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion. Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030. Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window. Our country&#8217;s unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt. Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030. To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget. We&#8217;ve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously. Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt. The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.  It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them. Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions &#8211; which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country. Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesn&#8217;t appear that we&#8217;ll have one this year either. In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year. Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget.  It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face. We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people. Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies. I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith &#8211; who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association &#8211; to discuss the Community Development Block Grant program&nbsp;and other initiatives that support housing and community development.  The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators. It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the University&#8217;s priorities. I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas. I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas. They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development. I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell &#8211; and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District.  My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.&nbsp;We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare.  I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year. The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief. While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House. The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence. Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient.  Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith. The funding &#8211; awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA) &#8211; will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD). These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.  Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District. This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation. By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities. Learn more .

Simply put, we cannot fight climate change without building a clean, energy-efficient economy. The legislation in my agenda aims to secure America&#8217;s path toward a sustainable future. Additionally, many of these bills have bipartisan support and demonstrate specific actions that Congress can take right away to reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to improve public health, strengthen our economy with green jobs, and protect the natural beauty we are so lucky to have in the Granite State. This week I also sat down with the Concord Chamber to discuss my Clean Energy Agenda and explore bipartisan solutions that can decarbonize our economy. From winter sports to maple harvesting, I look forward to my continued work to transition our state to a clean energy economy to protect all that makes the Granite State such a special place to call home. Empowering New Hampshire Businesses  This week I was glad to join community leaders at the New England Council (NEC) to give an update on my work in Congress and discuss how we can work together to grow New Hampshire&#8217;s economy and help our local businesses thrive. The NEC is a wonderful advocate for Granite State families and businesses &#8211; I look forward to our continued work together to ensure our state has the tools it needs to succeed and get ahead.       Working with community leaders to help the Granite State thrive.    Bipartisan Action to Prevent Fentanyl Overdoses&nbsp;  I led Wednesday&#8217;s House passage of the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. Fentanyl is killing people in New Hampshire and across the country. Communities throughout our state have been devastated by the opioid epidemic and we know that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are central to fueling this deadly crisis. We must use every tool available to reduce fatal fentanyl overdoses. On Wednesday, Congress took bipartisan action and averted disaster by ensuring that fentanyl remains a schedule 1 narcotic and members of our law enforcement community don&#8217;t have the rug pulled out from under them. I will continue to work across the aisle to ensure that we combat the opioid and substance abuse crisis from every angle.&nbsp;       Speaking on the House Floor about the legislation. Watch here.     USMCA Agreement Signed into Law  On Wednesday, President Trump signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. I voted in favor of the trade agreement last month, and I was glad to see Congress and the White House work together in a bipartisan way to get it over the finish line. Many Granite State businesses export goods and services to Canada and Mexico, and cross-border trade with our neighbors is crucial to the health and vitality of New Hampshire&#8217;s economy. The agreement signed on Wednesday includes provisions to enforce Mexico&#8217;s labor reforms and safeguard American jobs, more robust rules, and accountability mechanisms to protect our natural resources and improve access to Canadian markets for our dairy farmers.&nbsp;  In addition, House Democrats successfully blocked language in USMCA that would have raised prescription drug costs for Americans, and secured key enforcement provisions to protect American jobs and improve accountability with Mexican labor laws. The agreement that the President provided Congress had insufficient enforcement mechanisms in these key areas, and I was proud to work with my colleagues to fix these problematic aspects of USMCA. While I&#8217;m encouraged that the agreement includes improved environmental protections, there is more we can and must do to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to protect our environment, address climate change, and help the Granite State economy thrive. Honoring Christa McAuliffe  Tuesday marked the 34th anniversary of the Challenger disaster that took the life of Concord High School teacher Christa McAuliffe, along with the lives of fellow crew members Dick Scobee, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Mike Smith and Ellison Onizuka.&nbsp;  Everyone in New Hampshire remembers where they were on the day of the Challenger disaster. Our nation and the students who were privileged to have Christa McAuliffe as their teacher were heartbroken. Christa reached for the stars and inspired her students to do the same. I was honored to join my colleagues to help pass legislation just last year to create a commemorative coin to keep Christa&#8217;s pioneering spirit alive as she continues to spark a passion for science and exploration among younger generations.&nbsp;        Christa McAuliffe    My Guest at the State of the Union Next Week  I&#8217;m proud that Ross Cunningham, Superintendent of the Merrimack County Department of Corrections, will join me in Washington as my guest for the State of the Union Address next week. I deeply respect Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s extensive experience in our justice system and I am grateful for his dedication to ensuring vulnerable Granite Staters with substance use disorder can access the treatment they need. While we&#8217;ve made progress in our fight to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country, we have more work to do. Prevention, treatment and recovery go hand in hand with law enforcement in addressing substance misuse &#8211; we must end the cycle of addiction and incarceration. I&#8217;m glad to host Mr. Cunningham to signal our shared commitment to curbing substance use disorder and supporting those who struggle with addiction.  Here for You  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Patricia, a constituent from Littleton, who had an issue of concern regarding the Social Security Administration (SSA). My staff worked with SSA and helped resolve Patricia&#8217;s issue. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.  Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live. Have a great weekend!

I was proud to co-lead this legislation with Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), and managed its passage on the Floor on Monday. The bill would amplify the work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, leveraging a combination of public and private funds to develop and disseminate high-quality Holocaust education resources, which can be adopted by local schools and included in their curriculum. The bill has the support of more than 1,800 Holocaust survivors from 38 states, as well as 350 organizations from across the country. On Monday, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the House reaffirmed its commitment to remembrance by passing this bill to ensure the next generation of students understand the dangers of rising anti-Semitism and recognize that it must never be forgotten. As we continue to condemn horrific acts of anti-Semitism across the world, we must also take proactive measures to educate and provide states and schools with the resources necessary to incorporate Holocaust education into their classrooms, ensuring that all students understand the evils of Holocaust and its impact. I am honored to co-lead this important legislation, and I applaud my colleagues in the House for its bipartisan passage.&nbsp;Watch my opening remarks on the House Floor in support of this legislation&nbsp;here and above, and my closing remarks&nbsp;here.  Statement on President Trump Signing USMCA Into Law    This week, I proudly attended the signing of the USMCA trade agreement into law by President Trump. This is a significant victory for the North Country, and I am thrilled that the USMCA has been signed into law. This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy. It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets. I have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers, and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these.

Advocating for Rural Broadband for the North Country&nbsp;  Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a draft proposal for their new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which rendered all of New York ineligible for the $16 billion allocated in Phase I of the plan to expand high-speed broadband access. I called the Chairman of the FCC directly and sent a bipartisan letter with the New York delegation asking them to reverse this decision, and to reiterate the need for underserved areas in the North Country to be included in the funding. This week, FCC Chairman Pai sent a letter back to me&nbsp; stating that the proposal will be revised and areas of New York will be considered for Phase I eligibility under the general criteria. Expanding access to high-speed broadband is critical to the economic well-being of our region.&nbsp; The FCC reversing their decision to categorically exclude New York is an important step in the right direction, as this will open the door to much needed investment in the areas of North Country that still lack broadband connectivity. However, the FCC&#8217;s treatment of areas without high-speed access despite some state investment will be central to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund fulfilling its goal of truly closing the digital divide. I will to continue to work closely with the FCC throughout the development of this important initiative to expand rural broadband access in the North Country. Read more here.&nbsp;  Testifying Before Ways &amp; Means Committee on Bipartisan Paid Leave Proposal    This week, I testified before the House Ways &amp; Means Committee in support of H.R. 5296, the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, legislation I am leading with Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX). This legislation will help working families cover the cost of parental leave, infant care, and other expenses that occur with birth or adoption of a new child by advancing up to $5,000 of their Child Tax Credit. It is the only bipartisan and bicameral plan to help new parents access upfront financial assistance &#8211; and does it without raising taxes or creating new federal mandates. Developing solutions to help new parents and working families thrive in this modern workforce is necessary for the continued economic success of our nation and the well-being of the next generation of Americans. I will always advocate on behalf of hardworking North Country families to bring them tangible benefits and enhanced paid leave options as I continue to lead this effort through the House. Watch my full testimony here and above.&nbsp;  Cosponsoring Bill Protecting Voter Registration Systems Against Foreign Hacking&nbsp;  This week, I became an original cosponsor of the Protect American Voters Act, legislation to provide states with more adequate resources to secure their current and future election systems. This bill updates the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by directing the Election Assistance Commission to issue guidelines for &#8220;non-voting&#8221; election equipment, including electronic pollbooks, election night reporting systems, online voter registration systems, and other equipment. It also establishes the first-ever &#8220;Election Cyber Assistance Unit&#8221; to connect local and state election officials with leading election administration and cybersecurity experts from across the country. Securing our elections includes prioritizing the protection of voter&#8217;s personal information, which has been at risk to foreign hacking for too long. I am proud to cosponsor this bill to ensure election equipment is utilized in a way that protects voter information, and that states are provided with resources and guidance to secure their individual election systems. I am a staunch advocate for measures to protect American elections from any foreign interference, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this effort. Read more here.  Announcing USDA Primary Agriculture Disaster Designation for the North Country&nbsp;  This week, I announced a USDA Primary Agricultural Disaster designation for all twelve counties in New York&#8217;s 21st Congressional District. This designation comes after excessive rain and weather events caused massive losses during the 2019 crop year. This designation makes farm operators eligible to be considered for certain assistance from the Farm Service Agency (FSA), including emergency loans. Farmers in these counties have 8 months from the date of this declaration to apply for emergency loans, and they are encouraged to act as soon as possible.&nbsp;The weather events this past spring, including excessive flooding in many areas, took a toll on farmers across upstate New York. I am glad USDA has made this designation and will be offering aid to producers, who are vital to the North Country. I encourage any farmers who have questions about this application process to reach out to my offices directly. Read more here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!    Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read:  Press Republican -&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials praise signing of USMCA  President Donald Trump's signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law drew praise from organizations and North Country officials.  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville) lauded ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement's (NAFTA) replacement as a significant victory for the region.  \"This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy,\" she said in a statement.  \"It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets.  I am proud to have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these.\"  North Country Chamber of Commerce President Garry Douglas said nothing is more important to the area's economy than its cross-border economic partnership with Canada.  \"With the enactment of the enabling legislation for USMCA, we can expect the continued benefits that will flow from a renewed and predictable economic relationship,\" he said in a statement.  \"The North Country, more than any other area of the U.S., has made itself a uniquely supportive environment for Canadian-based manufacturing in the U.S. market and for cross-border supply chains.\"  Douglas said the North Country's transportation equipment and aerospace cluster is a prime example, with 50 companies employing more than 9,000 people.  New York Farm Bureau President David Fisher said nearly half of the state's agricultural exports go to the country's North American neighbors.  \"Thanks to the president&#8217;s signature on USMCA, goods will continue to cross borders to benefit our state&#8217;s farms and rural economy,\" he continued.  \"The agreement provides certainty to farmers as well as opens the door to additional market opportunities, most notably for our dairy farms.\"  Douglas and Fisher thanked Stefanik for her support of the agreement's passage.  \"Congresswoman Stefanik has been in the forefront of passage of the USMCA that is essential to balance and strengthen the capability of North America&#8217;s competitiveness and enhancing U.S.-Canada economic vitality,\" Canadian/American Border Trade Alliance President/CEO Jim Phillips said.  Trump, former Mexican President Enrique Pe&#241;a Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the USMCA on Nov. 30, 2018.  The Mexican Senate ratified the agreement in June, and in December voted overwhelmingly to accept changes made as a result of negotiations between House Democrats and the White House. _________________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

Rick Scott Applauds Passage of Resolution Recognizing National School Choice Week   Senator Rick Scott joined his colleagues in celebration of the passage of the resolution declaring this week as National School Choice Week.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud to join Senator Tim Scott and my colleagues to recognize National School Choice Week. As a father and grandfather, I know firsthand that every child learns differently and should have the opportunity to attend a school that best fits their needs. That&#8217;s why, throughout my time as Governor, I worked to make Florida a national leader in school choice, and as Senator, I&#8217;m working to build on these efforts to help our students succeed.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Tim Scott's HERE.  &#151;  Sen.

Rick Scott Applauds Interior Department&#8217;s Decision to Adopt No-Fly Rule for Drones Made in Communist China  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the Department of the Interior&#8217;s plan to formally adopt a no-fly rule aimed at drones made in China or with Chinese parts. Senator Scott introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, I&#8217;m glad to see the Department is putting national security first and adopting a no-fly rule for drones made in Communist China. The Trump administration sees the risks associated with using taxpayer dollars to purchase tech from a Communist government that is trying to spy on us. This is great news for our security. Now, we must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants. We must take the threat from Communist China seriously.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Urge President Trump to Include $250 Million for Everglades Restoration in Budget  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio in a letter to President Trump urging him to include $250 million for Everglades Restoration in his Fiscal Year 2021 budget requests to Congress.&nbsp;  This funding would build on the $200 million in construction funding for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Senator Scott, Senator Rubio and Governor Ron DeSantis fought for and secured last year, as well as the $2 billion in state funding invested in restoring the Everglades throughout Senator Scott&#8217;s time as Governor.

Rick Scott Asks Peace Corps Director for Plan to Immediately Get Out of Communist China  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps&#8217; plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China.

Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;This week, I raised questions about the $12.5 million Foley &amp; Lardner received to represent the illegitimate Maduro regime and announced that I would no longer meet with anyone from that firm. I&#8217;m glad they made the right decision to drop the Maduro regime as a client and return the money. It&#8217;s unfortunate they made the decision to give this murderous dictator legitimacy in the first place. I would recommend to Foley &amp; Lardner that they get involved in support of the people of Venezuela.&nbsp;   &#8220;Nicol&#225;s Maduro is perpetrating a genocide on the people of Venezuela. I&#8217;ve been to the border between Venezuela and Colombia. I met young mothers who trek hours through the jungle just to get their only meal of the day. I met children who travel through FARC-controlled territory to Colombia to go to school &#150; the only way they can get an education. Thousands have died, millions have fled, and Maduro and his cronies have gotten fat and rich. I hope the last few days will serve as a lesson to any other lobbying firms, consultants or organizations that if you support Maduro and his gang of thugs, I won&#8217;t stay quiet.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senador Rick Scott: Si alguien apoya a Maduro, no me quedar&#233; callado  El senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaraci&#243;n luego de que el bufete de abogados Foley &amp; Lardner respondiera al llamado del senador de abandonar a su cliente, el inspector general Reinaldo Mu&#241;oz, el principal abogado del brutal r&#233;gimen de Nicol&#225;s Maduro en Venezuela. El senador Rick Scott dijo: &#8220;Esta semana, hice preguntas sobre los $12.5 millones que recibi&#243; Foley &amp; Lardner para representar al r&#233;gimen ileg&#237;timo de Maduro y anunci&#233; que no me reunir&#237;a con nadie de esa firma. Me alegra que hayan tomado la decisi&#243;n correcta de abandonar al r&#233;gimen de Maduro como cliente y devolver el dinero. Es lamentable que hayan tomado la decisi&#243;n de dar legitimidad a este asesino dictador en primer lugar. Le recomendar&#237;a a Foley &amp; Lardner que se unan en apoyo al pueblo de Venezuela.  &#8220;Nicol&#225;s Maduro est&#225; perpetrando un genocidio contra la gente de Venezuela. He estado en la frontera entre Venezuela y Colombia. Conoc&#237; a madres j&#243;venes que caminan durante horas por la jungla solo para obtener su &#250;nica comida del d&#237;a. Conoc&#237; a ni&#241;os que viajan a Colombia a trav&#233;s del territorio controlado por la FARC para ir a la escuela, la &#250;nica forma en que pueden obtener una educaci&#243;n. Miles han muerto, millones han huido y Maduro y sus amigos se han engordado y enriquecido. Espero que los &#250;ltimos d&#237;as sirvan como una lecci&#243;n para cualquier otra firma de cabildeo, consultores u organizaciones que si apoyan a Maduro y su banda de matones, no me quedar&#233; callado \".&nbsp;Lea m&#225;s AQU&#205;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration For Heeding His Call to Declare Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump&#8217;s decision to declare the 2019 Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States, and announcement that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended entry into the United States. This decision follows Senator Scott&#8217;s call last week for the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.  Last Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agency&#8217;s plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Last week, I called on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States, and I am glad they heeded that call today. Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy. We still need to take additional steps to protect Americans, including increased screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China.  &#8220;China needs to do more to keep the world community accurately informed about the spread of the virus and follow America&#8217;s lead to ground Chinese commercial flights.&#8221; Read more HERE.              Sen. Rick Scott Warns UK: Allowing Communist China in Your Networks is a Mistake  Ahead of the United Kingdom&#8217;s decision to allow Huawei, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China, to build part of its 5G infrastructure, Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner warning the U.K. about the extreme risks associated with this decision.&nbsp;  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;&#133;Johnson and other U.K. leaders must be extremely careful when it comes to the threat of communist China and the implications for the United States&#8217; relationship with the U.K.  Put simply, the U.K. allowing Huawei to gain a foothold would be a grave mistake.  Huawei is a bad actor across the globe. It&#8217;s a company that aids the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights, steal our data, technology, and intellectual property, and build up their military to compete with us and other freedom-loving countries.&#133;  Countries that do business with Huawei eliminate their citizens&#8217; and their country&#8217;s privacy rights.&#133;  Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party are one and the same. We can&#8217;t forget that.  If the U.S. is going to consider a trade agreement with the U.K., it is imperative that Huawei is recognized as a threat to our national security partnership. The U.S. must put any trade deal with the U.K. on hold until Johnson commits to take swift action to ensure Huawei will not be used in their transition to 5G networks. This is for the security of both the U.S. and the U.K.&#133;&#8221; &nbsp; Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.   &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Peace Corps Needs to Stop Wasting Taxpayer Dollars and Get Out of Communist China Immediately&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent op-ed on the Peace Corps&#8217; decision to end its programs in Communist China. Senator Rick Scott also sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps&#8217; plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China.&nbsp;  In the letter to the editor, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;&#133;I&#8217;ve met with the Peace Corps director multiple times and asked her what the volunteers did in Communist China and why they were there&#133;.  When I asked what the return on investment was for the U.S. taxpayers, the director (shockingly) had no answer&#133;.  The Peace Corps finally came to its senses this month and said it is leaving Communist China. Since then, the director has refused to meet with me. I would love to hear its plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.&#8221;  Read the full letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal HERE.  &#151;  AP:   Politico:   Florida Daily:  Fox News:   Fox News:   Breitbart:   Washington Examiner:   Newsmax:   Military Times:   Florida Daily: Rick Scott Has Questions for House Democrats On Impeachment  Florida Daily:   Florida Daily:   WPEC:  Florida Daily:  VPI TV:               Congratulations to part-time Floridian Derek Jeter on being recognized for his incredible MLB career and being elected to the Hall of Fame!  &#151;  Florida is home to the best airport in the nation!

The hearing this week on the Horseracing Integrity Act was an important step in advancing reforms to protect our equine athletes and jockeys.

The impact of the Lexington Legends is no exception. The 2019 South Atlantic League Champion Legends bring an average economic impact of $47.2 million per year to our community, and in addition, donate an average of $1 million locally. I am committed to doing what I can to support the Legends and ensure that they stay in Lexington for years to come.

Take a look at the article below and let me know if you support my efforts to combat this growing problem in Florida and across the country.  Vern    Congressional delegation to tackle spike in Florida human trafficking Jacob Ogles  In one ranking no one will brag about, Florida ranks third in the nation for reported human trafficking cases. As Florida&#8217;s Congressional Delegation met for the first time in 2020, the topic drove the agenda.  &#8220;Human trafficking is a vile crime against children and women that flourishes in the dark shadows of society,&#8221; said Rep. Vern Buchanan, Delegation co-chair. &#8220;We need to bring it into the light, expose these atrocities and end what amounts to modern-day slavery.&#8221;  Executives from Sarasota-based Selah Freedom flew to Washington to press for action. Elizabeth Fisher Good, the organization&#8217;s founder, testified that early education must be part of any effort to reduce human trafficking.  She said there must also be an awareness of online activity, a ubiquitous part of the modern teenage experience.  &#8220;1 out of 9 children are now approached on social media,&#8221; Fisher Good said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t stranger danger anymore. That&#8217;s why education starting in kindergarten is vital.&#8221;  Congress members also heard from Dr. Heidi Schaeffer, a member of the Broward Human Trafficking Coalition, who traveled to Washington, D.C. &#8220;to increase awareness of this issue to as many healthcare professionals as possible &#8211; plus to the general public.&#8221;  Rep. Alcee Hastings, Florida&#8217;s other Delegation co-chair, has been working with Buchanan&#8217;s office on bipartisan legislation. The Boca Raton Democrat and Sarasota Republican introduced the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Prevention Training Act of 2019 (HR 4388) in September. Eight of the bill&#8217;s 19 co-sponsors represent Florida districts.  &#8220;Human trafficking victims suffer unspeakable acts of violence and exploitation,&#8221; Buchanan said. &#8220;This bill will address the problem in our home state and across the country. Congress needs to move swiftly and get this measure to the President&#8217;s desk.&#8221;  Thirteen of Florida&#8217;s 27 Congress members attended the Delegation meeting.  There, they heard from national experts on the growing crime.  &#8220;When we launched the war on drugs, everyone knew there was a war on drugs,&#8221; said Roger DeHart, founder of the group First S.T.O.P. (Saving Teens And Others From Predators).  &#8220;If we took that same approach with human trafficking, we might have more of an impact.&#8221;            &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

I've been hard at work in our fight to make housing a human right alongside some of my closest friends and allies.  Last weekend, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib joined me in Portland to talk about some of the most complex challenges we face in our pursuit to fix this crisis. She saw first-hand how it was impacting our community, we heard from constituents, and we shared our ideas for how we can begin to address it. This week, I partnered with other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus in unveiling our People's Housing Platform a groundbreaking, progressive housing framework that declares housing as a fundamental human right. Progressive champions Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal all joined me in chorus to call on Congress to get back in the game of federal housing through meaningful investment in public housing, renter relief, combatting homelessness, and equitable home ownership policies. We have much work to do, but the first step is establishing a shared commitment to solving the problem. The Congressional Progressive Caucus is leading the way. It's past time for the federal government to get back in the game of housing.

I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk' Earlier today, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation formally agreeing to a landmark North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate. Senator McConnell said the following about today&#8217;s signing: &#8220;By signing the USMCA into law, President Trump has delivered a strong trade deal for Kentucky families. I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk, and I look forward to its benefits throughout the Commonwealth. Virtually every family and every industry in Kentucky is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Once the USMCA takes effect, Kentucky&#8217;s workers, farmers and consumers are ready to take advantage of all it has to offer.&#8221;    Recently Senator McConnell penned the following column for Kentucky newspapers:  Kentuckians are rightfully known for being hard workers. I&#8217;m glad more of them, from Paducah to Pikeville, are benefitting from our country&#8217;s strong economy, which has been bolstered by Republican policies. The Republican-led Senate gave Kentucky workers another boost in an overwhelming vote by passing President Trump&#8217;s landmark trade deal called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and I was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate. Once in effect, the USMCA will modernize the trading framework that sends American goods&#151;including Kentucky-made products like bourbon, cars, aerospace parts and agricultural commodities&#151;to customers across the continent. These critical upgrades reflect the development of the new digital economy, bringing the existing deal into the 21st century. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats held President Trump&#8217;s deal hostage for months on end. Their obsession with impeaching the duly-elected president unnecessarily delayed the USMCA and its benefits for Kentucky. American workers and families have paid the price of the Speaker&#8217;s refusal to work with President Trump. In Kentucky, the partisan obstruction couldn&#8217;t end soon enough. Virtually every family and every industry is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Farmers, manufacturers and logistics providers right here in the Bluegrass State put their ingenuity to work every day making a wide-range of products enjoyed around the globe.  In 2018 alone, we sent more than $10 billion of Kentucky-made products to Canada and Mexico, representing nearly one-third of all our Commonwealth&#8217;s exports. These sales support good jobs and a strong economy for Kentucky families. The USMCA is our chance to double-down on that success, giving our workers and our communities the certainty they need. The deal&#8217;s new, stronger automotive rules can extend the eye-popping 90 percent increase in motor vehicle exports Kentucky sold to our neighbors over the last decade. International sales of Kentucky-made cars and trucks can lead to more hiring, bigger paychecks and new investments. Just ask the folks in Georgetown&#151;where Toyota recently announced it will hire about 400 new workers&#151;about the benefits of trade. It&#8217;s not just auto-manufacturing, either. Nearly 19,000 Kentucky manufacturing jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, including at more than 500 small- and medium-sized businesses. One study estimated the USMCA could help create 176,000 American jobs, strengthening our country and generating new opportunities for families and communities. Kentucky&#8217;s farmers are ready to take advantage of USMCA&#8217;s innovations that will strengthen and expand markets for their crops. Canada and Mexico bought more than $300 million of the Bluegrass State&#8217;s agricultural products in 2018. At a time when Kentucky growers are tightening their belts, we should do everything in our power to encourage more consumers to buy their wonderful products. Job creators in our state have told me they can grow their businesses and benefit their communities with the USMCA. For example, the deal provides trade certainty to help our distillers by allowing more folks to raise a glass of Kentucky bourbon. Major Kentucky employers like UPS and DHL are also looking forward to USMCA&#8217;s improvements to e-commerce and customs processes, designed to better protect small businesses competing in the online marketplace. They&#8217;ll be able to better connect businesses and consumers, while protecting the environment and American workers.  By approving the deal, the United States is signaling to our neighbors that America is open for business. Once all three countries pass the USMCA, Kentucky&#8217;s workers, farmers and consumers are ready to enjoy all the benefits it has to offer.  Since the day President Trump signed the USMCA with leaders of Canada and Mexico, the deal should have been a no-brainer. Speaker Pelosi should&#8217;ve allowed this deal to pass months ago, but I&#8217;m glad the heel-dragging has come to an end. I hope Democrats will see what we&#8217;re able to accomplish by working together for the people who sent us to Washington in the first place. Then, they can put partisan distractions aside and work with us to continue delivering results.

I enjoyed seeing friends and neighbors as we honored the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the 40th annual Tampa Organization of Black Affairs breakfast, parade and uplifting interfaith service at Allen Temple A.M.E. This week I continue to feel inspired by Dr. Kings words: Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Across the Capitol, the Impeachment trial of President Trump on his Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress continues. Thank you for contacting Floridas U.S. Senators to urge them to conduct a fair trial with witnesses and documents so that all information is made plain to the American people. Tune in today and tomorrow for question from senators. Committee Action (SCCC Logo): I called on Google this week to take steps to stop the spread of dangerous climate denial and climate misinformation videos on YouTube, the most used social platform in the United States as it has done with other dangerous misinformation. Google should take steps to address this harmful misinformation, including ending free advertising of videos promoting harmful falsehoods about the causes and effects of the climate crisis. Full text here. (E&C Logo): My Energy and Commerce Committee is holding two hearings: my Subcommittee on Consumer Protection & Commerce is holding a hearing is entitled, Legislation to Promote the Health and Safety of Racehorses, and my Subcommittee on Health is holding a hearing entitled Improving Safety and Transparency in Americas Food and Drugs. Votes This Week (Photo of KC with Students) H.R. 3621 Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020: This bill removes adverse credit file information relating to defaulted or delinquent private education loans for borrowers who demonstrate a history of timely loan repayments for their loans. Additionally, the bill provides much-needed protection for student loan borrowers by making repayment plans more affordable. (Photo of KC with military leaders) H.R. 550 No War Against Iran Act; To repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002: This bill includes amendments that would repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)  the Iraq Resolution of 2002 - and prohibit funding for military action against Iran that is not authorized by Congress. Since my first congressional campaign in 2006, I have supported a withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq and redeployment of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Although the Constitution vests Congress with the sole power to declare war, President Trump like other presidents before him has taken military action without consulting Congress. I will vote in support of repealing the 2002 Iraq AUMF so that it cannot be used to justify new and unrelated, offensive military actions. H.R. 943 - Never Again Education Act: On Monday, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the House adopted an important inititiave to combat antisemitism by passing bipartisan legislation to schools with tools to teach about the Holocaust. I'm proud to cosponsor this bill. We have a moral obligation to teach about the horrors of the past so they are never repeated. Thank you to the many neighbors and community leaders I saw last week on collaborations to lift our Tampa area neighbors. AARP joined me in highlighting the importance of the House of Representatives passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act to level the playing field for older workers and restoring their rights to fight back against age discrimination. Members of my Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force also joined me to discuss what Tampa nonprofit and community leaders are doing to assist families on the island and those who have relocated to the Tampa Bay area due to Hurricane Maria and recent earthquakes that continue to shake the island. I also helped kick off the University of South Florida College of Public Health Activist Lab Boot Camps session on firearm violence prevention, which provides students with the tools necessary to address todays ongoing public health concerns and communicate with public policymakers.

Both the CDC and HHS were very transparent and answered all of my questions about logistics and medical protocol that will be followed to monitor the health of every passenger on the flight. The information I was given made it clear that everyone on board is being closely monitored by medical personnel and receiving medical screenings to ensure their safety and the safety of others. As a consequence of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in China, the Department of State ordered the repatriation of State Department officials and their families, as well as U.S. citizens, in the Wuhan region, back to the United States. The Department of Defense is collaborating with the CDC and HHS to provide March Air Reserve Base with the support they need to assist in this process and to protect the public health of our communities. The federal government&#8217;s top concern is ensuring that these Americans return home safely without posing a risk to others.&nbsp; I am fully aware of the situation and will be monitoring it closely. My staff and I are communicating with the CDC and HHS and receiving updates as they become available. Members of our community should be aware that strict precautions are being taken to protect public health and to ensure that passengers traveling from China and servicemembers and employees at March Air Reserve Base are safe. I would like to thank CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield and HHS Assistant Secretary Dr. Robert Kadlec for their professionalism and transparency during this process. The health and safety of every American must be our top priority. Feel free to stay in touch on this, and any other issues you care about or if you have further concerns.

Now, months later, some of our neighbors are still picking up the pieces and struggling to rebuild their homes and businesses.&nbsp; This is a priority for me. I recently led a bipartisan group of my Texas colleagues in the House in writing a letter to President Trump urging swift approval of Governor Abbott&#8217;s disaster declaration request. If approved, it would make much-needed disaster relief funds available to affected North Texans.   Rep. Allred surveys the damage left by the October storms to assess how he can help recovery efforts at the federal level.&nbsp;  The Insurance Council of Texas has estimated that the tornado caused $2 billion in insured losses, making it one of the most costly natural disasters in our region&#8217;s history. The federal disaster declaration would ensure North Texas receives the vital FEMA funds needed to repair our public infrastructure, strengthen our local economy and help many in our community get back on their feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the president to sign Texas&#8217; disaster declaration. I am fighting every day to ensure that North Texas gets the recovery funds it needs.&nbsp; If you need help or have questions regarding storm recovery resources, I encourage you to call my office in Richardson at (972) 972-7949.&nbsp; It is an honor to represent the 32nd District of Texas, where I was born and raised.&nbsp;  Sincerely,   Colin AllredMember of Congress                          &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Washington, DC Office 328 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 (202) 225-2231     &nbsp;  Richardson Office 100 N.

Here is a quick recap of my week around the First District:   I kicked off the work period with  with Rep. Joe Courtney where we talked about our vote to impeach the president, our work to make sure Americans in Puerto Rico receive the aid they deserve, and our efforts to deescalate tensions in Iran. We also talked about the 475 bills (including 275 bipartisan bills) that passed in the House and are awaiting action in the Senate. From lowering prescription drugs to establishing universal background checks on gun purchases and protecting our democracy, we&#8217;ve been hard at work on behalf of Connecticut residents. The next day I visited Howell Cheney Technical High School to present Rocio, Jalah, and Jazzlin with Congressional Certificates of Special Recognition for . Their winning app &#8220;School of Math&#8221; is a testament to the STEM talent in the First District and I was proud to join them to recognize their achievement.      I then joined Senator Blumenthal, Mayor Bronin, and activists in  to protect residents&nbsp;from slumlords and to ensure residents using Section 8 vouchers live in safe, affordable, quality housing.      Later in the week I  to discuss PFAS contaminations along the Farmington River, along with the recent House-passed PFAS Action Act. This bill would require the EPA to designate PFAS as hazardous substances and force polluters to clean up their contamination. To cap off the week I held a  Connecticut receives $11 billion in federal funding&nbsp;each year based on Census data. These funds go towards things like educational programs, health care, law enforcement, housing, and infrastructure. Having a complete and accurate 2020 Census count is vital to ensuring Connecticut is well represented!  Please stay tuned to my and pages to keep up to date on what&#8217;s happening in Washington.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking a moment to learn about&nbsp;what happened&nbsp;in our nation's capital and Texas last week.  Rebuilding After Hurricane HarveyOver two years ago, our region was rocked by Hurricane Harvey. The storm took a lot from our communities, including some folks' homes. Rebuilding can be a long, difficult road, but we are #HoustonStrong and we saw the best of Texas and humanity as we came together to help our neighbors in times of need. Mosaic in Action and AmeriCorps are doing incredible work helping those who lost their homes to Harvey rebuild. It was an honor to&nbsp;join volunteers and staff to see firsthand how this public-private partnership is rebuilding peoples' homes and lives.

This year we celebrate the Year of the Rat, the first animal in the Chinese Zodiac's 12-year cycle. The rat is a symbol of abundance and people born in the Year of the Rat are believed to be smart and creative. It was such fun ringing in the Year of the Rat at the Sugar Land Chinese New Year Festival. It was wonderful to see so many people come out and celebrate this vibrant culture!&nbsp;As we celebrate this important occasion, we also stand with the families here and abroad affected by the Wuhan coronavirus. They are in our prayers for quick healing.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s powerful teachings of love and tolerance in the face of fierce hate echo through time and serve as an example we should all aspire to follow. As we reflect on Dr. King&#8217;s inspirational life and leadership, I hope we can all strive to find the common good that unites us and dream of a more perfect Union together.&nbsp;  My Statement on Impeachment  As the impeachment trial is underway in the Senate, I am focused on fulfilling my constitutional duty as an impartial juror and my responsibility to listen to both sides present their case. Impeaching the president is one of the most serious constitutional actions, and I will closely evaluate the law and facts presented to the Senate. The Senate moved forward with an organizing resolution that is modeled after the same basic principles as the Clinton impeachment proceedings and established guidelines for a bipartisan trial allowing both sides to present their case.  Senate Passes USMCA Trade Agreement   Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner's remarks.  The Senate recently passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) with my support, which is great news for Colorado&#8217;s workers, our agriculture industry, and our economy. The USMCA is an important opportunity for the United States to gain more jobs, incentivize more economic growth, and create more opportunity for the people of Colorado. This agreement will continue to boost Colorado&#8217;s already vibrant trade relationship with our two largest global trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Without a free trading relationship between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, Colorado&#8217;s agriculture community would suffer, leaving dairy farmers in Northern Colorado, wheat farmers on the Eastern Plains, cattle ranchers on the Western Slope, and potato farmers in the San Luis Valley, among others, without major marketplaces for their exports. We have to give all of our Colorado exporters the best chance to access markets around the world and USMCA is a welcome modern agreement that helps us retain that access in North America.  Nearly $32 Million to Address Homelessness in Colorado   Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner's remarks.  I recently announced that Colorado is receiving nearly $32 million in grant funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to address homelessness in Colorado. HUD is also designating a fourth Continuum of Care (CoC) in Colorado for Larimer and Weld counties, which will help us address the specific needs for Weld and Larimer counties. Last July, I was honored to host HUD Secretary Ben Carson in Aurora to discuss Colorado&#8217;s affordable housing needs. I commend him for listening to our unique needs and for his willingness to help. This roughly $32 million in funding will go a long way to help the homeless population in our state, and I look forward to continuing our work together to address Colorado&#8217;s housing challenges and make it more affordable for everyone to call Colorado home.  New North Korea Sanctions As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, I welcome the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s new sanctions against entities that participate in North Korea&#8217;s supply of slave labor abroad. These sanctions were mandated by my North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act (NKSPEA) of 2016, signed into law in February 2016, and my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) that was signed into law in December 2018. I also renew my call for the international community to increase the pressure on North Korea, as Kim Jong Un continues to build his illicit weapons programs and engage in human rights abuses against his own people. I urge the Trump Administration to ramp up the maximum pressure campaign against Pyongyang and its enablers until such time as the regime fully complies with international law. Through bipartisan legislation like NSKPEA and ARIA, Congress has spoken loud and clear that the goal of any negotiation with Pyongyang should be the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.  Preparing for the Industries of the Future I introduced the Industries of the Future Act of 2020 with Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Gary Peters (D-MI). This bipartisan legislation will advance the U.S. global leadership in artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, quantum information science, synthetic biology, and next generation wireless networks. As technology continues to evolve, bringing new opportunities and challenges along with it, it&#8217;s critical the United States plan ahead for the Industries of the Future. This bill will help America prepare for new innovations and technologies that will change the world and increase the quality of life for people everywhere. I&#8217;m proud to be part of this bipartisan legislation to help ensure we remain a global leader in technology. Congratulations to the President of Taiwan I extend my warmest congratulations to Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan&#8217;s fourth democratically elected leader, on winning a second presidential term. It was an honor to host President Tsai in Colorado last year, and it&#8217;s been a privilege working closely with her to advance the friendship between our nations during my multiple visits to Taipei. As China continues its aggressive campaign to delegitimize Taiwan, it&#8217;s critically important for the United States to reaffirm our support for Taiwan&#8217;s resilient and vibrant democracy, and to further grow the bonds of friendship between the people of Taiwan and the United States.

It was great to speak at&nbsp;Leadership Collierville&#8217;s Government Day on Wednesday. We discussed the importance of efficient and ethical governance at all levels. Many thanks to&nbsp;James Lewellen, Collierville Town Administrator&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mayor Stan Joyner&nbsp;for having me!  &nbsp;      On Tuesday, I was honored to attend the Weakley County Commission meeting in Dresden with my friend&nbsp;Andy Holt&nbsp;to present Beth Worley VanCleave with a flag in honor of her late husband Roger VanCleave. Commissioner VanCleave was a great man who dedicated his life to serving our country and Weakley County.     I visited&nbsp;Burks Beverage&nbsp;in Dyer County. Burks Beverage has been a family run business that has distributed Pepsi products since 1931. It was great to sit down with Eddie Burks and discuss how the current economy under President Trump&nbsp;has helped the future of this business.      I appreciated sitting down with Dyer County Mayor Chris Young and former Alderman Bob Kirk. It was great to learn how I can continue to best represent Dyer County up in Washington.     I stopped by&nbsp;Wilder Lp Gas Company&nbsp;to discuss energy and propane issues in West Tennessee and how to ensure residents are receiving their service effectively and efficiently. Thank you for a great visit!   On Thursday, I visited TLM Associates in downtown Jackson and spoke with President Randy McKinnon about business and the great economy under President Trump.&nbsp;      I enjoyed catching up with everyone at the Jackson Chamber for their Elected Officials Appreciation Dinner this week.&nbsp;     Thank you to Superintendent Dr. David Stephens for giving me and&nbsp;Mayor Keith McDonald&nbsp;a great tour of the newly renovated and still expanding Bartlett High School! These impressive new facilities will give students the proper tools and opportunities to prepare them for a brighter future.      I wrapped up my week with a stop to the Bartlett Police Department to greet new Police Chief Cox. I appreciate our visit and I look forward to working closely with you.        In the News Rep.

I was very disappointed to see Republicans repeatedly vote against requiring the Trump administration to turn over relevant documents and having firsthand witnesses testify. I hope that before this trial has concluded, Republicans will allow for both these documents and witnesses to be included. The American people want a fair trial and they deserve to see the full truth. As a juror, I took an oath to be impartial as I carefully review all the evidence and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll continue to do. Our founders believed, as I believe, that nobody is above the law in this country and that&#8217;s why getting this impeachment trial right is so important.  It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate. It&#8217;s been a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues I&#8217;ve been addressing and working on.  &nbsp;  Turning the Tide of the Substance Use Disorder Epidemic   A roundtable discussion on the substance use disorder epidemic with first responders, treatment providers and community leaders in Derry. Treatment providers, first responders and families are working hand-in-hand to turn the tide of the substance use disorder epidemic facing our state. This week, I  respond to this crisis. On Tuesday, Senator Hassan, Representative Kuster, Representative Pappas and I called on the Trump administration to continue funding the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program in the President&#8217;s budget proposal for fiscal year (FY) 2021. The SOR grant program has been a vital tool for New Hampshire and other states on the frontline of the substance use disorder epidemic. Our success in meeting the challenge of this crisis is only possible if we continue to commit resources to support prevention, treatment and recovery for Americans struggling with substance misuse.  On Wednesday,  to quickly provide new guidance to states on the implementation of the provision  that gives treatment providers flexibility to use federal funding provided by the SOR grant program to help patients suffering from meth and cocaine dependencies in addition to opioid use disorders. Previously, federal law only allowed SOR grants to be used by providers to treat patients suffering from opioid-related substance use disorders. This new flexibility is a welcome change that will allow states like New Hampshire to remain nimble in addressing an evolving substance use disorder crisis.  &nbsp;  Holding E-Cigarette Companies Accountable  In New Hampshire, our high school students are using e-cigarettes more than their peers in every other state in the nation. Teachers and parents are overwhelmed by the youth vaping crisis&#151;a crisis that&#8217;s the result of e-cigarette manufacturers marketing their products directly to young people. These companies should be on the hook for the funding to respond to this crisis.&nbsp;  On Tuesday, I introduced  to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes. This legislation gives FDA the authority and resources the agency needs to hold e-cigarette companies accountable, crack down on e-cigarette sales to minors and raise awareness among youth about the dangers of vaping. Congress and the Trump administration need to act to address this crisis and passing this legislation would be a major step forward.  &nbsp;  President Trump Recklessly Threatens New Hampshire Water Quality  Earlier this week, the Trump administration decided to move forward with plans to  that protect New England&#8217;s streams and wetlands. Considering the substantial water contamination challenges New Hampshire already faces, it is absolutely reckless of the Trump administration to overrule hard science and side with special interests to rollback these regulations. Protecting our streams and wetlands is about preserving our natural environment and preventing chemicals from making their way into our drinking water. Allowing pollutants to be dumped into New Hampshire's valuable wetlands without even requiring a permit is a direct threat to water quality in our state. Families in New Hampshire need to have confidence that their tap water is safe. This rule takes us in precisely the wrong direction.  &nbsp;  An Important Anniversary for New Hampshire    Signing the resolution recognizing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a state holiday with Martin Luther King III.  Monday marked the 20th anniversary of New Hampshire first celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This anniversary was personal for me. I fought alongside so many when I served in the New Hampshire State Senate for an appropriate way to honor Dr. King, the preeminent leader of the civil rights movement. Years later, as Governor, I was proud to sign the bill into law that ended New Hampshire&#8217;s status as the only state not to recognize his birthday as an official holiday. It was an exciting time that reflected the positive change that many of us had seen in our lifetimes. We have made great strides since then in the march toward full equality, and these advancements are the product of Dr. King&#8217;s leadership and the peaceful, nonviolent protest movement that he championed.  &nbsp;  We Are Not Going Back   This week marked the 47th anniversary of the Supreme Court&#8217;s Roe v. Wade decision &#150; a landmark case that determined legal and constitutional safeguards for what many of us already morally believed to be true: women&#8217;s reproductive health care decisions belong to them, not their government.&nbsp;  Roe has had a dramatic impact over the past 47 years. The Supreme Court decision ushered in a new era for women&#8217;s health, reducing the number of dangerous back alley abortions and expanding access to family planning services and contraceptives, which have helped reduce abortion rates to historic lows.  As we look back on decades of progress, we do so knowing that the rights secured by Roe v. Wade have never been more in danger since the decision was first handed down. Republican efforts to overturn Roe, restrictive state laws that seek to shut down abortion clinics, and the Trump administration&#8217;s incessant attacks on family planning programs continue to put women&#8217;s health at stake.  I&#8217;m inspired by the groundswell of activism by women and girls of all ages in response to these attacks on women&#8217;s health, and I believe that together we can fight off these efforts and keep pushing forward. We stand on the shoulders of generations of women who fought to get us here. We can&#8217;t go back. We won&#8217;t go back.  &nbsp;  Need Help? Contact My Office  One of my most important responsibilities as a U.S. Senator is assisting New Hampshire residents who need help navigating federal agencies. I&#8217;ve worked with my staff to help Granite Staters avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, deliver delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance, and access VA benefits, among many other services. If you have an issue with a federal agency, you can open a case . If it is time-sensitive, you can call my Manchester office at (603) 647-7500. Here are a few testimonials from Granite Staters who have been helped:  Denise Littlefield, Newmarket: Denise contacted my office after her family property in Londonderry was reduced in size due to eminent domain required for the expansion of I-93. Construction had led to significant impacts on the property, including the flooding of their parking area. Denise had faced challenges getting the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to respond to the issue. My staff inquired with both agencies and after months of persistence, the flooding problem was addressed and her parking area was successfully restored.&nbsp;  George Delaney, Manchester: George was put in touch with my office for assistance with his Social Security claim. He was concerned he would lose his family home unless the situation was addressed quickly. My staff inquired with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and, within a few weeks, the SSA made a favorable determination and George received his first benefit check.&nbsp;    Sincerely,   &nbsp;  ###  To opt out of future eNewletters, click here.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington, DC506 Hart SOBWashington, DC 20510Phone: (202) 224-2841 Manchester, NH2 Wall Street Ste. 220Manchester, NH&nbsp;03101Phone: (603) 647-7500 Claremont, NH50 Opera House Sq.Claremont, NH 03743Phone: (603) 542-4872 Nashua, NH60 Main StreetNashua, NH 03060Phone: (603) 883-0196 &nbsp;             &nbsp; Dover, NH340 Central Avenue Suite 205Dover, NH 03820Phone: (603) 750-3004 Berlin, NH961 Main St.Berlin, NH 03570Phone: (603) 752-6300 Keene, NH12 Gilbo Ave. Suite CKeene, NH 03431Phone: (603) 358-6604 &nbsp;            ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"F","state":"NH","party":"Democrat","score":1.8142385},{"name":"Representative Steve Womack","address":"AR03SWIMA@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-01-24","subject":"From the Front...","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }             News from Representative Steve Womack          HOME&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;ABOUT STEVE&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;SERVICES&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;3RD DISTRICT&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;ISSUES &amp; LEGISLATION&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;NEWSROOM       January 24, 2020    WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this week&#8217;s From the Front&#8230; I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation&#8217;s capital, including Thad and Kelli Butcher of Cave Springs. Safe travels back to the Natural State!  It was a district&nbsp;work&nbsp;week, which means I got to spend time doing my favorite thing: traveling throughout Arkansas&#8217;s Third Congressional&nbsp;District!  I started my week in Russellville, where I stopped by Sequoyah Elementary School! The school was recently named a National Blue Ribbon recipient. This distinction from the U.S. Department of Education recognizes outstanding and high-performing schools that demonstrate high levels of success from all of their students. Sequoyah Elementary has embraced and integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) curricula and created an innovative learning environment. Another fun fact is that the Sequoyah Robotics Team 5805T won the &#8220;Excellence Award&#8221; at the VEX IQ Challenge Tournament last month. Preparing students to excel in an ever-changing global workforce is a priority for educators and business leaders alike. Sequoyah&#8217;s STEAM curriculum is developing competitive, well-rounded students and supporting our next generation of skilled workers. It was wonderful to meet with the 3rd and 4th grade classes and talk about education, leadership, service, and community! I appreciated their engaging questions, which included &#8220;Why did you run for office&#8221; and &#8220;What do you do as a Congressman?&#8221; I told them to always lead by example and to be good influences on each other.   I then stopped by Russellville High School and had the opportunity to meet some fellow Cyclones. It was great to able to meet the varsity basketball team and talk about the upcoming season. As you might know, I&#8217;m a member of the RHS Class of 1975!  Our region is home to many people willing to give back and improve the well-being of Arkansans.&nbsp;It was an honor to participate in a flag raising ceremony at the Arbors of Russellville. Taking care of our seniors is always a priority, and it&#8217;s important that we continue to support resources that help our elders. Investment in research for things like Alzheimer's and other conditions will be vital to making progress towards a cure for many devastating diseases. The ceremony included the singing of the National Anthem, the introduction of Arbors staff members, and a dedication of halls to community members. I thank Herschel Howard and Mikel Fuller from the Marine Corps Lake Dardanelle Detachment for presenting the flag, which was previously flown over the U.S. Capitol.   The next day, I headed down to Fort Smith to meet with the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority. I appreciated getting a firsthand look at railway infrastructure and also talking about general development in our area.   The success of any city or nation is based on leadership and community. &nbsp;When residents are willing to get involved, work together, and develop local initiatives &#8211; the quality of life in an area increases. It was a privilege to join residents who are part of Leadership Crawford County - which helps educate and motivate citizens to become local leaders - and discuss public service.&nbsp;Participants will act as catalysts for many important projects and developments in our region. My next stop was to City Heights Elementary in Van Buren! I met with students and recognized their distinction as a National Blue Ribbon School! Their motto is &#8220;Making a difference one student at a time!&#8221; and they focus on small group instruction and utilizing engaging, student-centered programs. &nbsp;I&#8217;m extremely proud that out of the two schools that received Blue Ribbon status in Arkansas in 2019, both were based in the Third District. It&#8217;s a true reflection of the hard work of educators and students in the Natural State!  During the assembly, I got asked some great questions, including &#8220;How do you become a Congress member?&#8221; and &#8220;What is your greatest accomplishment?&#8221; I talked about my different positions throughout my career, including my time in the military, as a financial advisor, and as Mayor of Rogers! I was also able to talk about my challenge coin and hand them out to students. As I pointed out, the coin says: &#8220;Lead by Example; Lead from the Front.&#8221; I&#8217;m confident that these impressive students will take it to heart!  I also dropped in to say hello to the Mayor of Alma, Jerry Martin. We had productive discussions on a variety of issues, including city priorities, growth, and the business environment. As both a Congressman and former&nbsp;mayor, I understand the importance of the work being done on the community level and appreciate hearing updates from our local representatives.  Today, I started my morning in Fayetteville. I always appreciate having the opportunity to talk about government, civics, and leadership &#8211; and I loved spending time with students from Fayetteville Christian School.  Many of these students are learning about U.S. history! My favorite question of the day: &#8220;Did you ever meet George Washington?&#8221; I might not have been around for the 1700s, but we do have the same hair color!   While I was there, one of the students also challenged me! I &#8211; of course &#8211; had my challenge coin with me! You know what that means: push-ups for my challenger, Zander. Even though I won the challenge, I decided to join in on the push-ups as well! Thanks to Fayetteville Christian School for the warm welcome. I hope our conversations inspire students to think even bigger and reach their goals. Maybe some will even run for student council! My next stop was to the University of Arkansas&#8217;s Startup Village, where I sat down with local startup teams and entrepreneurs, including Lapovations and AMBOTS. The entrepreneurial spirit of Arkansas has led to the creation of Fortune 500 companies - and it is incredible to see people continue to harness the innovative heritage of our area and develop new technologies and businesses.  Washington needs to ensure that we are implementing policies that create an environment ripe with opportunity &#8211; not one that overregulates and stifles innovation. It&#8217;s always amazing to learn more about the work being done in the district - and to meet with the many people who are helping to unleash and support our strong entrepreneurial ecosystem.  I then drove to&nbsp;Springdale&nbsp;to take part in the Chamber&nbsp;of&nbsp;Commerce&#8217;s Banquet. We&#8217;ve seen a lot&nbsp;of growth and development - and gatherings like this support those efforts. A big congratulations to Jim Crouch, the recipient of the 2020 Civic Service Award!  Our law enforcement officers serve Arkansas and defend our communities each day. They are our frontline protectors, and it was my honor to attend the dedication ceremony for the new Arkansas State Police Headquarters in Lowell. Thank you to all of our men and women in uniform!  ICYMI: This week, the Trump Administration announced the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which replaces the 2015 Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule. The new directive provides regulatory clarity and ends Obama-era federal overreach.  This announcement marks an important step in restoring state authority and stopping improper federal overreach. Localities are best equipped to manage the water and land within its borders &#8211; and this new directive rightfully reverses a power grab by Washington bureaucrats under the previous administration. With this new rule, we are protecting America&#8217;s waterways and providing certainty to hardworking farmers, ranchers, and landowners. I have fought against the misguided Obama-era version of this regulation since it was introduced and thank the Trump Administration for taking decisive action and implementing a balanced approach.

Epimed is a medical device manufacturing company who focuses on high-quality and effective specialty devices. I was able to tour the facility and discuss my result of successfully repealing the full medical device tax, which was a top economic priority. Electro-Metrics Antenna Design is a leading designer, producer and integrator of antennas, sensors, and systems for broadband communications and testing. One of my top priorities is growing our North Country manufacturing and expanding opportunities for defense contractors to work with the Department of Defense. It is always amazing for me to see the production diversity that we produce in the North Country and to hear about ways that I can help support our manufacturers!&nbsp; Attending Fulton-Montgomery Regional Chamber of Commerce Event      Over the weekend, I was honored to attend the Fulton-Montgomery Regional Chamber of Commerce 2020 \"Cheers to Business\" event in Gloversville. Ten businesses and individuals were honored for their success and contributions to our community.&nbsp; I was proud to present copies of the Congressional Record to recognize each one of these businesses. Supporting local business in the North Country is critical to our local economies, and I will continue to advocate on behalf of businesses like these in Congress. Statement On Being Named a Member of President Trump's Impeachment Defense Team  I was honored to be named by President Trump as a Member of his Impeachment Defense Team. Not only was there bipartisan opposition to impeachment in the House, Adam Schiff has continued to mischaracterize key facts. The facts are clear: there was no investigation into the Bidens, and Defensive Lethal Aid was provided to Ukraine by the Trump Administration. The Democrats case is flimsy and weak. I am proud to stand up for the Constitution, my constituents in New York&#8217;s 21st District, and the American people&#8217;s vote. As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!    Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read: The Sun Community News -&nbsp;Stefanik co-sponsors legislation on new bail reform laws  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan Bill&#8217;s Promise Act, legislation that would direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of how individuals on pretrial release are monitored at the federal, state, and local levels.  Under New York&#8217;s new bail reform policy, cash bail is not required for most defendants accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felonies including those arrested for drug possession, or even many property crimes like theft and burglary. Instead, the law encourages alternatives such as supervision by a pretrial services agency.  The bill addresses issues surrounding pretrial release programs in New York and ensures communities are not put at risk; the legislation was carefully developed with input from the law enforcement and anti-violence advocacy communities.  &#8220;I am proud to co-sponsor this bill to address dangerous bail reform policies that continue to put our communities at risk,&#8221; said Congresswoman Stefanik. &#8220;This legislation will require an assessment of failed bail reform laws exactly like the one that Governor Cuomo has implemented in New York, which has had significant impacts in the North Country and put many communities at risk. I stand united with local law enforcement and various members of our communities against these harmful bail reform policies and look forward to working with my colleagues to moving this legislation forward.&#8221;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  _________________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

We toured the campus and discussed the incredible work that is happening in the schools' agriculture and environmental science departments. We also talked about how students are preparing to enter the workforce in emerging industries, including hemp production.&nbsp;  Wednesday morning, I had the pleasure of meeting with young students at Bonner Middle School in Danville. It is always a pleasure to visit 5th District schools and talk to students about what it is like to be in Congress and the work that we are doing for them.  I also had the chance to meet with small business owners in the Danville River District and discuss the important work that&nbsp;is happening to revitalize the area.&nbsp;  Next, I spoke at the Virginia Agricultural Growers Association annual meeting in South Boston. Farming and agriculture are the largest industries in the 5th District, and I will always stand with our farmers. We discussed the United States- Mexico- Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and how hemp can be a&nbsp;transformational crop for Southside.&nbsp;  Afterward, I held a roundtable discussion with Sentara Halifax Regional Hospital. I joined local constituents and healthcare professionals to talk about how we can ensure all Virginia residents have access to quality, affordable care.  It has been a fantastic experience to travel across the 5th District this week. I promise to continue working for you here in our district and in Washington.&nbsp;  If you need help with a federal agency, please contact my Charlottesville Office at (434) 973-9631 or see my staff during our mobile office hours on Tuesdays across the 5th District.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking a moment to learn about&nbsp;what happened&nbsp;in our nation&#8217;s capital and Texas last week.  Keeping America Competitive &amp; Helping Our Environment New technologies allow industry to phase down refrigerants that cool our homes and refrigerators to more environmentally friendly options. American companies and environmental groups agree this is an important step to improving air quality and creating jobs. That&#8217;s why Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY) and I teamed up to introduce the bipartisan&nbsp;H.R. 5544, the American Innovation and Manufacturing Leadership (AIM) Act,&nbsp;a bill that achieves this goal. Our bill will begin a phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) &#8212; a type of coolant most commonly used in air conditioners and refrigerators &#8212; and promote the development of next-generation, eco-friendly alternatives. This bill has the support of the U.S. air conditioning industry, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and NRDC. We had a hearing on the bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We are hoping to move this bill to the House floor in the coming weeks. Click here for my official statement.  Celebrating the Legacy of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai It was an honor to participate in the Latif Day ceremony at the Turkish Raindrop Center in Stafford. The celebration commemorates the life and work of the great Sindhi Sufi poet and scholar Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai who passed away in 1752. His work focused on the principles of unity and acceptance. This legacy is proudly carried on by the people of TX-22, the most diverse district in the nation!        Olson celebrates Latif Day at the Turkish Raindrop Center&#8217;s ceremony    Modernizing the Endangered Species Act Protecting endangered species can and should be done in a practical way so future generations can enjoy our wildlife. But the current system serves as a weapon for extreme environmentalists. It allows outside groups to petition to include species as endangered in a short and inflexible time frame to force settlements on the federal government.  That&#8217;s why I recently reintroduced H.R. 5585, the Listing Reform Act, which will modernize the ESA by giving the federal government needed flexibility to prioritize the most endangered species first with a sensible approach to the process. I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense reform.  Discussing&nbsp;the Future of Space City, USA The Johnson Space Center is and will continue to be the hub of out-of-this-world endeavors, especially as we move into the next generation of space flight. I recently spoke with Politico about the future of our space program. Check out my interview here.  Remembering the Exodus of Hindus from Kashmir Thirty years ago, thousands of Kashmiri Hindus were forced to flee their homes and communities, leaving the vast majority of them displaced. It was an honor to speak at the Kashmir Exodus Day candlelight vigil remembering the exile of the Kashmiri Hindus on the anniversary of this horrible event.

I was privileged to welcome 27 farmers to Washington from throughout the South Plains to meet with lawmakers and discuss how policies like these help support those who feed and clothe our nation. The House is in recess and I'm looking forward to spending time with constituents during my time back home this week. Your voice is very important and I encourage you to please reach out to my office with any thoughts or concerns you have about what is going on in our country and communities.&nbsp; Below you will find a recap of last week and to ensure you're receiving the latest updates from Washington and across West Texas I&nbsp;encourage you, and all of our fellow&nbsp;West&nbsp;Texans, to&nbsp;follow me on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and like my page on&nbsp;Facebook.  Honoring our Community Heroes Nicholas Reyna and Eric Hill understood the sacred call to service. They gave the ultimate sacrifice and demonstrated the greatest love for their fellow man. May God welcome these earthly heroes into their heavenly kingdom and comfort their families.

West Texas Farmers Fly-In Nearly 30 farmers from all across the South Plains joined me in Washington as our historic USMCA&nbsp;and Phase One&nbsp;trade agreement with China became a reality. These West Texans wanted to tell the story of the food, fuel, and fiber capital and had a special message commending Donald J. Trump&nbsp;for securing a $50B agriculture purchase commitment - 2x the amount ever purchased by China before.

It is an honor to represent West Texas wheat growers in Congress.&#8236;    President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush Coin Act&nbsp; Last week I spoke in favor of the President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush Coin Act sponsored by my friend and fellow Texan,&nbsp;John Cornyn. George and Barbara Bush were the ultimate examples of leadership, service and the purest picture of a loving and devoted marriage. This coin will honor their lifetime of public service to our nation.    Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I'm grateful for Dr. Martin Luther King, an American hero, and his efforts to help us live up to our ideals as a nation that &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221;. I remember learning about Dr. King as a boy. I was moved by his courage and awe-struck by his strength of character in the face of such great persecution. But, what inspired me most about Dr. King was the way he chose to fight. It was clear that his source of strength was his faith in Almighty God and his firm belief that love &#8220;never fails&#8221; (1 Corinthians: 13:8).

Deploying life-saving telehealth services to areas that need them most will help save lives. That&#8217;s why I introduced the&nbsp;bipartisan Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act to require the Federal Communications Commission to connect broadband and health data, and improve the health and well-being of Hoosier families.&nbsp;Fox 59 and WDRB covered my recent visit to Jeffersonville&#8217;s Clark Memorial Health Hospital where I discussed this bill.  Martin Luther King Jr. Day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will forever be remembered as a great American hero, a custodian of hope, and a man of peace who challenged our nation to love one another and live up to our founding principles. Along with countless others who bravely led the Civil Rights Movement, his words helped us become a more perfect union. This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I joined University of Indianapolis students and faculty for their Pack Away Hunger drive to feed neighbors in need.&nbsp;   USMCA Passes: A Win for American Workers and Farmers Last week, I was proud to support the USMCA trade deal that passed the Senate in a 89-10 vote.  House Democrats held up USMCA for over a year. During that time, tens of thousands of Hoosier jobs supported by exports to Canada and Mexico were on the line. Last week, the Senate passed this historic trade agreement and marked a win for American workers, including Indiana&#8217;s farmers and manufacturers. This agreement is finally able to help modernize the outdated and unworkable North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and secure freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth.

One Piece of the Affordable Housing Puzzle America&#8217;s housing affordability crisis is complex, and there is no one solution that will ensure everyone has access to housing they can afford. But one potential solution is manufactured housing. Last week, I spoke at a manufactured housing show about my HUD Manufactured Housing Modernization Act, which will help state and local governments consider manufactured housing as a solution. Indiana leads the nation in construction of these homes, which are a viable alternative to traditional construction. Read more about my legislation here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;BONUS: On Friday, I also visited Guerin Woods in Georgetown, Indiana. This organization provides affordable housing and life skills training to Hoosiers in need.    Veterans and Motorcycles It was too cold to ride in Indiana, but that didn&#8217;t stop the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association from having its annual meeting in Brown County this weekend. I had the opportunity to visit with the Indiana chapter on Friday to thank them for the work they do to lift up fellow veterans and to talk about how Congress is rallying around our service members as well. &nbsp;One of my priorities in 2020 is passing my bill to give blind and disabled veterans access to TSA PreCheck for free. The men and women who have sacrificed their bodies in service to our country should not have to suffer the indignity of extensive searches at airport check points. &nbsp;I also talked about how our office can provide constituent services to veterans who are having problems with the federal government. Watch the video below to see how we recently helped one Hoosier veteran.   &nbsp;   Jobs Report Brings Good News for Hoosiers Last week, I spoke about the recent jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor that delivered more good news for the American economy. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.5 percent in December, 145,000 new jobs were added, and wages continued to grow.  The economic policies championed by President Trump and the Republican-led Senate are working for Hoosiers and for all American workers. We need to continue this momentum.

It represents the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the Reagan presidency - a longtime goal for Republicans. This tax reform came with a lot of promises, like higher economic growth, a simpler code, lower rates for middle-class families, and restored American competitiveness on the global stage. Two years in, every one of those promises has been kept. The United States&#8217; economy is reenergized and on stronger footing thanks in large part to this landmark legislation. A Record of Success&nbsp;  The most obvious benefit of the tax cuts is increased take-home pay. A family of four making the median annual income in our country had their taxes reduced by $2,058. A single parent with one child and an annual income of $41,000 had their bill reduced by $1,304. All in all, 90 percent of workers are keeping a larger share of their money today than they were before December 2017. During the past two years, wages have surged particularly for low-income earners and those without high school diplomas. According to new data from the Council of Economic Advisors, earnings have grown faster among rank-and-file workers than managers. Additionally, wealth has grown at a higher rate for low-income Americans than the top one percent. This good news directly benefits Mississippians. At a House Small Business Committee hearing, a grocer from Woodville reported that the law has allowed him to upgrade and replace equipment and provide employees with raises. Shipbuilders on the Gulf Coast saw bonuses and larger contributions to their pensions. More than 100 areas in Mississippi are now &#8220;opportunity zones,&#8221; attracting private investment from outside sources to communities in need. An opportunity zone in Claiborne County alone could attract up to 1,000 construction jobs. Tax reform has also helped our country become a net exporter of petroleum. The law opened up 2,000 acres in Alaska for responsible oil and gas development. More American energy means more jobs, a stronger economy, and less reliance on foreign and potentially hostile sources of oil and gas. Under our nation&#8217;s old tax code, our businesses were at an international disadvantage. America&#8217;s corporate tax rate was 35 percent, higher than any other in the developed world. The reduction to a 21 percent rate was followed by an increase in U.S. business investment, which has helped fuel our economic resurgence. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implemented a lot of new, good ideas. It also repealed burdensome rules and regulations, including the individual mandate in Obamacare. Under that failed provision, people who could not afford or did not choose to purchase Obamacare&#8217;s increasingly expensive plans were punished again with a new tax. This burden hurt low-income Americans more than any other group, and the repeal is a much-needed relief. Pro-Growth Policies Work  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act&#8217;s success shows that pro-growth polices work. Unlike proposals to give more power to Washington, tax cuts restore decision making back to individuals. In doing so, they empower all Americans and help people and families across this country achieve their economic potential.&nbsp; Today the American economy has powerful momentum, and there is every reason to be optimistic about the future.  &nbsp;  Other news this week:  Wicker Celebrates Senate Passage of USMCA  Wicker Statement on U.S.-China Trade Agreement     &nbsp;    Follow me on Facebook for daily updates  Follow me on Instagram&nbsp;for behind the scenes photos&nbsp;  Follow me on Twitter for my most recent statements   Unsubscribe to future eNewsletters here.

Every day I&#8217;m grateful for the brave men and women who place themselves in harm&#8217;s way to keep all of us safe. Jaime and I would also like to send our thanks to the families of our law enforcement and first responders. Every day these men and women say goodbye to their loved ones, unsure of what that day will hold for them. Watch my recent remarks on the floor of the United States Senate thanking the law enforcement officers who make sacrifices on our behalf every day and&nbsp;remembering the dedicated law enforcement officers we lost in Colorado in 2019.  Tri-State Announcement The news that&nbsp;Tri-State is closing the Craig Station plant and the Colowyo Mine&nbsp;is terrible news for Craig and northwestern Colorado. These are well-paying jobs that for years have allowed surrounding rural communities to thrive. The people that live and work in Craig and northwestern Colorado are some of the toughest and most resilient people I know, and I look forward to working on their behalf in the coming years as we fight for jobs and opportunity for every area of Colorado, not just on the Front Range. Coloradans Helping Fight the Australia Wildfires   Read more about the Coloradans fighting the wildfires in Australia from&nbsp;KDVR.  I&#8217;m amazed by the Coloradans who work every day to protect Colorado&#8217;s forests and are now helping fight the horrible wildfires in Australia. I'm praying that God watches over the brave firefighters and all our friends in Australia during this difficult time.  Colorado&#8217;s Economy is Thriving Great news for Colorado&#8217;s workforce: According to a new study,&nbsp;total job growth in the Fort Collins-Loveland area ranks 9th among cities across the entire United States. At the same time,&nbsp;the unemployment rate in Colorado tied the historic low, and&nbsp;the unemployment rate in Colorado Springs is only 0.1% away from the lowest rate ever recorded since 2001. Our economy continues to outperform expectations as Americans are keeping more of their hard-earned money. Pro-growth policies and lower taxes are delivering bigger raises for Americans, as&nbsp;wages for rank-and-file workers are rising at the quickest pace in more than a decade. I&#8217;m proud of the great economic success we&#8217;ve achieved, and I&#8217;ll continue to push for policies that allow every corner of Colorado to grow and thrive.  My Remarks on Iran  Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner's remarks. &nbsp; I recently spoke on the floor of the Senate regarding the ongoing situation in Iran. I hope the latest events have made it clear to Tehran that the United States will never back down from protecting our people, our interests, and our allies. It&#8217;s now in Tehran&#8217;s court to choose the path of peace, or the path of confrontation. It is my sincere hope that they choose the path of peace. Senate Passes Bipartisan DIGIT Act The Senate passed the bipartisan&nbsp;Developing and Growing the Internet of Things (DIGIT) Act, which I reintroduced with Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Cory Booker (D-NJ). As connected technology continues to evolve, it&#8217;s critical that Congress and the federal government leverage innovation developed in the private sector. The DIGIT Act would convene a working group of federal entities and experts from the private and academic sectors tasked with providing recommendations to Congress on how to facilitate the growth of connected Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This will improve coordination between the federal government and the technology industry and create opportunities for further deployment of secure IoT devices.

First, President Trump secured a historic trade deal with China. For too long, China has been allowed to be a bad actor. Phase one of this trade deal will work to rebalance our trade partnership with China to benefit American business, farmers, manufacturers and other hardworking Americans. Among other things, China has committed to purchasing an additional $200 billion in American goods over the next two years. China has also agreed to purchase between $40 and $50 billion in American agricultural goods each year for the next two years. Also this week, the Senate just approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and it's headed to President Trump's desk. I was proud to vote for the USMCA in the House because It has been estimated that it will create more than $68 billion in new economic activity and 176,000 new jobs here in America. THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats finally voted to send their articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate this week. Throughout their entire impeachment process in the House, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle demanded that it was urgent to impeach the President, and it must be done as soon as possible. However, after they voted to impeach, Speaker Pelosi let the articles sit on her desk for nearly a month. This has proven to the American people that there was never an urgent need to impeach the President and has allowed the public to see what we have been saying all along  this is a sham impeachment based on political games and emotions instead of fact. We discuss this and more on this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

Before you dive in to your weekend, I wanted to give you a quick snapshot of the work I&#8217;ve been doing for Iowans, including two major wins on the trade and agriculture front with the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the signing of the phase one trade deal with China.   Getting USMCA Across the Finish Line  It was hard work, and it took way too long, but we did it: this week I helped pass the USMCA out of the Senate, sending the critical trade deal to President Trump&#8217;s desk and final ratification.  I&#8217;ve heard time and again from Iowa&#8217;s farmers, manufacturers, and business owners about the need for the USMCA. And each time, for more than a year, I would convey that message loud and clear to my colleagues in the House. Finally the Senate was given our chance to take swift action and passed this agreement with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.    Click here or on the image above for a video recap of my efforts to pass the USMCA.  I joined Bloomberg TV to discuss the positive impacts of the USMCA for folks in Iowa and across the country.    Click here or the image above to watch my interview with Bloomberg TV.   Joining President Trump at the White House  Earlier in the week, I was honored to join the President, Senator Chuck Grassley, and Governor Kim Reynolds at the White House for the signing ceremony for the phase one trade agreement between the United States and China. As Iowa&#8217;s 4th largest trading partner, China is a critically important market for Iowans, and this phase one deal &#150; which is especially promising for our ag and manufacturing sectors &#150; will help provide certainty for folks back home.   Snapped a quick selfie with Senator Grassley and Governor Reynolds at the White House.  Following the ceremony, I joined Neil Cavuto on Fox Business from the White House lawn to discuss this win for Iowa.&nbsp;    Click here or the image above for a video clip of my interview.   Kicking of My Sixth 99 County Tour  The start of the new year also means the beginning of another 99 County Tour. There&#8217;s no better way to represent Iowa than to be out meeting with and hearing from Iowans in all of our communities, which is why this annual tradition is so important to me. Last weekend, I kicked off my sixth 99 County Tour, making visits to Montgomery, Adams, and Madison Counties.    Click here or the image above to watch KAAL-TV&#8217;s coverage of my 99 County Tour kickoff.  During my 99 County Tour stops, I heard from Iowans about the importance of getting both the USMCA and the phase one trade deal with China done. I&#8217;m extremely pleased to report back to that we delivered on both!   There&#8217;s no doubt that this is an exciting start to the new year for our great state of Iowa. From the phase one China agreement being finalized to the USMCA moving through the Senate, I&#8217;m proud to work with President Trump to deliver real results for Iowa&#8217;s farmers and manufacturers.

This week, the Senate passed the USMCA&nbsp;to support American businesses, President Trump released disaster funding for Puerto Rico at Senator Scott&#8217;s urging, and Senator Scott continued to push for answers on exactly what led to the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola so we can make sure our men and women in uniform are safe.&nbsp; Also this week, Senator Scott co-sponsored:   The No Work, No Pay Act of 2019 to make sure Congress doesn&#8217;t get paid if they don&#8217;t do their job. A resolution designating the week of January 26th through February 1st, 2020, as National School Choice Week. A resolution designating January 16th as Religious Freedom Day.  See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.              Senator Rick Scott Applauds Decision to Make Bases Safer, Pushes for Hard Reset of Foreign National Training Program  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after an update on the findings of the FBI investigation into the shooting at NAS Pensacola last month.&nbsp; &nbsp; Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad federal officials are taking steps to make our bases safer, including sending a number of potentially dangerous individuals back to their home country. This is a positive step, but more must be done when it comes to addressing the failures in this program that led to the tragic terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola. Given the FBI&#8217;s confirmation that a number of Saudi nationals engaged in troubling conduct, it&#8217;s clear we need a hard reset. I&#8217;m calling on the Saudi government to recall all Saudi nationals training in the U.S. back to their home country until the Department of Defense can conduct a full review of the program. I will continue to work with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Inhofe and administration officials to get to the bottom of exactly what went wrong so we can figure out if these training programs are safe to continue.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott to 82nd, 101st Airborne Divisions: You Should Be Incredibly Proud of Your Mission  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions recognizing their significant and historic role in World War II and thanking them for their work to protect our nation, our allies, our families and our freedoms. Senator Scott visited Belgium and Luxembourg last month to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge and honor the soldiers who proudly served our nation during World War II, including the Senator&#8217;s father. Read more, including the full letters, HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott Urges Florida Universities to Submit Responses on Plan to Combat Threat of Chinese Influence  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following his letter to Florida university presidents requesting information on the steps they have taken to safeguard technology and intellectual property from the influence of foreign adversaries, including Communist China.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We cannot take the threat from Communist China lightly. They are actively trying to use strategic relationships to advance their geopolitical and economic goals, which threatens our nation&#8217;s security. I appreciate the responses I&#8217;ve received from some Florida universities detailing the steps they are taking to protect their information from Communist China. But I&#8217;m still waiting to hear from many universities in Florida. Everyone needs to understand this risk, and I look forward to hearing back from every institution as we work to protect our universities and our students.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott Statement on China Trade Deal  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the President&#8217;s signing of Phase 1 of the China trade deal.&nbsp; &nbsp; Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I applaud the President for trying to negotiate deals that put American businesses first. But Communist China never lives up to its commitments and I don&#8217;t believe they will honor this deal. Communist China is militarizing the South China Sea, breaking the agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom, and attacking religious freedom by detaining possibly more than one million Uyghurs in internment and re-education camps. Our relationship with China is about more than just trade. We have to talk about human rights and we have to talk about China&#8217;s growing influence around the world. The United States has been down this road before with Communist China. They never live up to their agreements, so why should we believe them now?&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott on the Peace Corps Ending Programs in Communist China: I&#8217;m Glad They Finally Came to Their Senses  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Peace Corps announced its decision to wind down operations in Communist China. This decision follows months of Senator Scott calling for the Peace Corps to get out of Communist China, and the introduction of Senator Scott&#8217;s Peace Corps Mission Accountability Act, which prohibits all Peace Corps activity in hostile countries, including Communist China. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad the Peace Corps has finally come to its senses and sees Communist China for what it is: the second largest economy in the world and an adversary of the United States. Communist China continues to be a horrible human rights violator, one of the largest polluters in the world and a geopolitical threat. There is no reason we should prop up our adversaries with U.S. tax dollars. I&#8217;ve repeatedly asked the Peace Corps to pull all volunteers and resources from Communist China immediately, and I&#8217;m glad they finally decided to start protecting both taxpayer money and the American people. I will also be asking the Peace Corps to present their plan to me to ensure a speedy withdrawal of their resources in Communist China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Senate Passage of USMCA  Senator Rick Scott applauded the Senate&#8217;s passage of the United States&#150;Mexico&#150;Canada Agreement (USMCA). Senator Rick Scott spoke about his support of the USMCA in a meeting of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation this week after receiving commitment from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that Florida&#8217;s seasonal produce growers will be protected. Watch video from the hearing HERE.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud the Senate passed the USMCA as we work with the Administration to negotiate trade agreements that put American businesses first. I want to thank President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for all the work they did to get this deal done. While the deal is not perfect, I have received written commitments from USTR that they will work to make sure all Florida growers&#8217; concerns are properly addressed and domestic seasonal producers in Florida are protected. I will not stop fighting until Florida growers have what they need to succeed.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott joins Senator Daines and Colleagues in Resolution Recognizing Religious Freedom Day  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Steve Daines and colleagues to introduce a resolution designating January 16th as Religious Freedom Day.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;As countries around the world, like Communist China and Iran, refuse to respect religious liberty. It is more important than ever that the United States recognize this basic right, and I will always fight to protect our religious freedoms.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Daines&#8217; office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration for Releasing Puerto Rico Disaster Relief Funds and Heeding His Call for Transparency and Accountability&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#8217;s (HUD) release of $8.3 billion in disaster relief funding to help Puerto Rico&#8217;s ongoing recovery after Hurricane Maria. HUD will also appoint a Federal Financial Monitor, which follows Senator Scott and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz&#225;lez-Col&#243;n&#8217;s letter to President Trump asking the Administration to appoint a Federal Coordinator to oversee responsible implementation of Puerto Rico&#8217;s disaster funding. The Coordinator will ensure disaster relief funding gets to the Island&#8217;s families in a transparent and efficient manner.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I am proud the Trump Administration is releasing disaster aid funding for Puerto Rico to help the Island recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. I&#8217;ve spoken to President Trump multiple times about the importance of getting Puerto Rico the resources they need in a transparent and efficient manner. I&#8217;m glad the Administration decided to appoint a Federal Financial Monitor, which I fought for to make sure that families in Puerto Rico get the help they need following the devastation of Hurricane Maria and that U.S. taxpayer money is spent wisely. I will continue to do everything I can to support our brothers and sisters on the island.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  El senador Rick Scott aplaude a la administraci&#243;n Trump por liberar fondos de ayuda para desastres en Puerto Rico y atender su llamado a la transparencia y rendici&#243;n de cuentas  El senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaraci&#243;n luego de que el Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano de los Estados Unidos (HUD) liberara $8.3 billones en fondos de ayuda para desastres y as&#237; continuar ayudando a Puerto Rico en la recuperaci&#243;n en curso luego del hurac&#225;n Mar&#237;a. HUD tambi&#233;n designar&#225; un monitor federal, como solicitado en la carta del Senador Scott y la Congresista Jenniffer Gonz&#225;lez-Col&#243;n al Presidente Trump pidi&#233;ndole a la administraci&#243;n que designara un coordinador federal para supervisar la implementaci&#243;n responsable de los fondos para desastres en Puerto Rico. El coordinador se asegurar&#225; de que los fondos de ayuda para desastres lleguen a las familias de la isla de manera transparente y eficiente.  El senador Rick Scott dijo: &#8220;Estoy orgulloso de que la administraci&#243;n Trump est&#233; liberando fondos de ayuda para desastres para Puerto Rico y as&#237; continuar ayudando a la isla a recuperarse de la devastaci&#243;n del hurac&#225;n Mar&#237;a. He hablado varias veces con el presidente Trump sobre la importancia de que Puerto Rico obtenga los recursos que necesita de manera transparente y eficiente. Me alegra que la administraci&#243;n haya decidido nombrar un monitor federal, el cual solicit&#233; para asegurarme de que las familias en Puerto Rico reciban la ayuda que necesitan despu&#233;s de la devastaci&#243;n del hurac&#225;n Mar&#237;a y que el dinero de los contribuyentes estadounidenses se gaste sabiamente.

The letter urges all tourists to stand for freedom and reconsider plans to visit Cuba, since a trip to Cuba supports the ruthless Cuban regime, which denies Cubans their basic rights and controls everything and everyone on the island.

Rick Scott on Fox: Congress Needs to Stop Wasting Time on Impeachment and Get Back to Work&nbsp;Watch the full interview HERE or below.    &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: My Father&#8217;s Fight for Freedom During World War II Continues to Inspire Me  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for Fox News about his father, a World War II hero, who inspires him to fight for freedom every day.  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;My dad&#8217;s story is the story of many in his generation. Born in 1925. Kicked out of his house at&nbsp;9&nbsp;because his parents got divorced and neither could afford to feed him. He grew up during the&nbsp;Depression&nbsp;with almost nothing by moving in with family and friends. He joined the Army as a teenager.&#133;  But I often wonder if he recognized how important he, and those like him, were to the fabric of American society.&nbsp;I think for my dad, a man who never had any financial success, World War II was a time he felt important.  We seldom give credit to the men and women who struggle financially and simply show up,&nbsp;day&nbsp;in and day&nbsp;out,&nbsp;doing the best they can. I think that&#8217;s a mistake. They are the foundation of a country that always yearns for more, for better. The forgotten men and women not only must not be forgotten, but they must also be appreciated, valued.&#133;  Last&nbsp;month,&nbsp;I went to Luxembourg&nbsp;for&nbsp;the 75th&nbsp;anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.&nbsp;  I learned about the German surprise attack on American troops. About how American troops were initially outnumbered three to one. About Germans massacring unarmed American prisoners of war. About the lack of food and medicine. About the bitter cold and snow. About&nbsp;sleeping in foxholes&nbsp;with no&nbsp;winter clothing.&#133;  I always loved my dad. I was always proud of him. But as I learned more about what he and others did to make sure we have the freedoms we&nbsp;enjoy,&nbsp;I was even more awe-inspired.&#133;  Freedom is fleeting and worth fighting for. I hope we will never forget the&nbsp;primary goal of the&nbsp;federal government&nbsp;is to provide for the common defense,&nbsp;so our children and grandchildren live in freedom and peace, and our sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters never have to fight in the dead of winter for American freedom.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE. &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott to Floridians: Thank You for the Opportunity to Work on Your Behalf  Senator Rick Scott wrote and op-ed reflecting on his first year in the United States Senate and thanking Floridians for the opportunity to fight for them in Washington.&nbsp; In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, \"...This year, we got some big wins for Florida. Following my questions at a Homeland Security Committee hearing, the FBI finally acknowledged they held their employees accountable for mistakes prior to the Parkland shooting, and revamped and improved their tip center process.  The Federal Department of Transportation made significant investments in Florida&#8217;s infrastructure and I fought to secure the full $200 million for Everglades restoration.  In December, President Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which included a number of provisions that I fought for, such as an authorization of over $1.5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base, a well-deserved raise for our military, a provision to hold Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro accountable and a restriction on buying Chinese products that are a risk to our safety and security.  I know my job: make life better for the 22 million who call Florida home.  Forcing the federal government to embrace competence, efficiency and common sense will not be easy. But we have to do it. Thank you for the opportunity to work on your behalf.\"  Read the full op-ed in the Florida Times-Union HERE.  &#151;  WFLA:   Florida Daily:   Gray TV: shooting  CNBC:   CNBC:   Florida Daily:   Washington Post:   Breitbart:   Florida Daily:   The Epoch Times:               Sen.

It was a very eventful week in Washington and I'm excited to tell you about what we accomplished. Here are some highlights:   The FBI announced an official policy change to inform state officials of local election systems breaches I introduced the United States-Israel PTSD Collaborative Research Act to leverage our partnership with Israel to research and treat veterans with PTSD I discussed the U.S.' competition with China at the House Armed Services Committee hearing President Trump approved the request for&nbsp;a major disaster declaration for Puerto Rico to provide assistance in the wake of recent earthquakes   PROTECTING OUR ELECTIONS:&nbsp;On Thursday, the FBI announced a new policy committed&nbsp;to informing state officials of local election systems breaches. As many of you may recall, two Florida counties' elections systems were infiltrated by Russians in 2016. Four years later, voters in those counties still don't know that their data had been accessed. Thursday's announcement follows legislation I introduced with Rep. Stephanie Murphy last year requiring the Department of Homeland Security to notify state and local officials, certain Members of Congress and potentially affected voters when an election system breach. While I'm glad the FBI is changing its policy, I will continue to ensure voters are informed when elections systems are breached. Our elections system is the most critical piece of infrastructure to preserve our republic, so it is vital that we do all we can to promote transparency and protect our elections.&nbsp; &nbsp; WORKING WITH ISRAEL TO TREAT PTSD: Serving in combat changes you &#8211; and many times, adjusting to civilian life again can be difficult. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) doesn't discriminate. It affects&nbsp;veterans from all different backgrounds and nationalities. Israel and the U.S. are strong allies on the battlefield and should work together to care for our veterans when they return home. To ensure our veterans lead happy, healthy lives, we must also be allies in veteran's health. That's why my colleagues Rep. Elaine Luria Rep., Chrissy Houlahan and Rep. Lee Zeldin and I introduced legislation to&nbsp;leverage our partnership in combat with Israel for research, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD. Together we can work to ensure our veterans lead the happy, healthy lives. &nbsp;  DETERRING CHINESE INFLUENCE:&nbsp;Right now, we are engaged in a cold war with China &#8211; and China has been in one with us for a while. It's time for us to wake up and realize we can't just sit back as China oversteps and intrudes on the political and economic structures of countries all over the world. We must mobilize our allies against China to finally put the pressure needed on China's authoritarian regime to deter President Xi's plans for global domination now and in the future.&nbsp;On Wednesday, I spoke during the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) hearing on the Department of Defense's role in competing with China. &nbsp; Click below to watch my questions on preventing Chinese influence: &nbsp;  &nbsp; HELPING PUERTO RICO:&nbsp;As you may know, Puerto Rico has been hit by hundreds of earthquakes since the end of December. The destruction has devastated our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and they need help to rebuild and recover. Last week, I sent a letter along with my colleagues from Puerto Rico and fellow Floridians in Congress colleagues to&nbsp; for Puerto Rico. A disaster declaration would authorize federal aid to help the island recover from these earthquakes. On Thursday, President Trump signed the Major Disaster Declaration for Puerto Rico, which will allow for debris removal and public safety. In Congress, we&#8217;re doing all we can do help but please continue to keep the people of Puerto Rico in your thoughts and prayers as they recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please follow my daily work on social media by&nbsp;liking my&nbsp;Facebook page&nbsp;and following me on&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram.&nbsp;As always, feel free to reach out to my offices in Florida or Washington, D.C. if my team or I can ever be of service.

On Wednesday, President Trump signed Phase One of a comprehensive trade deal with China. For too long, China has taken advantage of the United States, but this step forward solidifies that our country is willing to go above and beyond to support American industries, promote our high-quality products, and level the playing field.&nbsp;  This agreement will have an extraordinary impact on Central Washington's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers who are ready to increase production and sales to our largest international trading partner. I look forward to continued negotiations of Phase Two as we continue to promote smart, fair, and beneficial trade policies with China and other countries around the world.&nbsp; Learn more about the U.S.-China trade deal and how it will benefit Central Washington.    Click here to watch my reaction to the Senate passage of the USMCA.  On Thursday - following the successful signing of the China deal - the Senate passed the USMCA! I have been calling for a vote on this critical trade agreement between Canada and Mexico for over a year. Now, this bipartisan agreement is headed to the President's desk. With 40% of Washington state's jobs tied to international trade, this is huge for our farmers, manufacturers, and producers.&nbsp;  Strengthening the Endangered Species Act  As we know all-too-well in Central Washington, Endangered Species Act listing and delisting decisions have huge, lasting impacts on local communities and environments. Under current law, only conservation efforts taking place within \"critical habitats\" of endangered or threatened species are considered during environmental review or impact studies of federal actions. I introduced the WHOLE Act to establish a process that considers the totality of ongoing conservation efforts to incentivize private investment in species recovery, streamline federal decision-making, and promote the comprehensive efforts of states, local communities, and tribes.&nbsp;  Click here to learn more about the WHOLE Act.  Standing with Australia   Click here to watch my remarks on the House floor.  In the West, we recognize the catastrophic impact wildfires have on local communities, ecosystems, and environments. Washington state recently experienced the worst wildfires in our state's history, and Australian firefighters were eager to help. Now, as Australia experiences bush fires burning over 12.5 million acres of land, U.S. firefighters are returning the favor - including two local heroes from Central Washington.  I'm proud to cosponsor a resolution introduced by my friends Rep. Panetta (D-CA) and Rep. LaMalfa (R-CA) to support the longstanding partnership between the United States and Australia, as we share firefighting resources in times of crisis, and the firefighters who put their lives on the line to protect our lands, our wildlife, and our loved ones.&nbsp; Where No Woman Has Gone Before  Click here to watch my remarks on the House floor in celebration of Kayla's accomplishments.&nbsp;  A big congratulations to Kayla Barron of Richland on becoming one of just 48 NASA astronauts in the nation! Kayla recently graduated from NASA's astronaut basic training program and has the opportunity to become the first woman on the moon. I applaud Kayla's ability and willingness to go above and beyond to set an example for women of all ages who may be interested in going where no woman has gone before.

Safe travels back to the Natural State!  The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including a Resolution to approve a request from the Department of Veterans Affairs to pursue a pilot program to increase veteran access to dental care (H. J. Res. 80), the Homeless Assistance Act (), the Prudential Regulator Oversight Act (), the Expanding Opportunity for Minority Depository Institutions Act (), the Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience Act (), the President George H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act (), the 8-K Trading Gap Act (H.R. 4335), which requires the SEC to issue new rules prohibiting executives from trading during the four-day gap between when a significant event that impacts the company happens and when the company publicly files a Form 8-K to alert the public and shareholders of the event, the Veteran HOUSE Act (), a Resolution appointing and authorizing managers for the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, President of the United States (), the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (), and a Resolution providing for Congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to \"Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability\" (). Unfair trade practices and policies have allowed countries to win on the backs of hardworking Americans. For decades, China and many other players have taken advantage of the United States. The result has been jobs moved overseas, stolen intellectual property, currency manipulation, limited market access, and lost opportunity.  That changed when President Trump took office. One of his top priorities is to put America first and secure fair and reciprocal trade deals. He made clear that having a seat at the table isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; we need to be leading on issues that matter to the United States. And, this week, a momentous step was taken as the President signed Phase One of a historic trade agreement with China. With the advancement of this deal, we are righting wrongs that have hurt U.S. businesses, farmers, and families &#8211; and securing a more prosperous future for our exceptional nation. This fully enforceable agreement rebalances our vital trade partnership with China and boosts opportunity for American businesses, farmers, manufacturers, and innovators.&nbsp;Key provisions include:   American-made products: China has pledged to increase imports of American goods and services by at least $200 billion. &nbsp; Agriculture purchases: China will be purchasing billions of dollars' worth of goods from U.S. farmers. Market access: Decreased barriers for U.S. products, including beef, pork, rice, wheat, dairy, and more. No more forced technology transfers: For the first time ever, China agreed to end its practice of forcing American companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition for doing business there. Fairer currency practices: Beijing has agreed to stronger commitments on its practices regarding currency devaluations and exchange rates.  This isn&#8217;t the only recent trade win for our nation. Thanks to the President and the diligent work of U.S trade representatives, China reopened its markets to poultry &#8211; which was shuttered for years &#8211; and we have negotiated fairer policies with Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Canada. On top of that, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the critical USMCA passed the Senate this week and is now headed to the White House for signature! This agreement with Mexico and Canada provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity with two of our top trading partners. With a roaring economy and new trade deals with global partners, it&#8217;s evident now more than ever that pro-growth policies and strong leadership are ushering in a new era of prosperity, success, and growth.  Unfortunately, the concentration on delivering tangible results to the American people is not a priority shared by all of my colleagues. While President Trump signed the Phase One trade deal, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was handing out pens and posing for pictures smiling as she initialed documents to send articles of impeachment to the Senate. The contrast in agendas between parties couldn&#8217;t be more clear than those two images. As President Trump and Republicans fight to deliver wins to U.S. families, workers, farmers, and consumers, the Democrats remain transfixed with trying to remove a duly-elected President. Imagine the progress that could be made if all of Congress were focused on issues that contribute to the strength of the U.S. In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State and have a great Arkansan testify before the House Budget Committee. It was my distinct honor and privilege to welcome Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) Secretary Larry Walther to speak at a hearing titled &#8220;Why Federal Investments Matter: Stability from Congress to State Capitals.&#8221; Secretary Walther brought perspectives on Arkansas&#8217;s budget and planning processes, including the state&#8217;s focus on fiscal responsibility. As he noted, &#8220;Arkansas maintains a true balanced budget approach to funding state programs. We do not commit state dollars until we have those dollars in hand and available to spend.\" This focus on fiscal responsibility is something that Washington could use more of. The power dynamic between the federal government and state and local governments has become greatly skewed, overly dominated by federal control, and far out of line from what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The point is that state and local governments, along with private sector innovation, are best equipped to address domestic needs. The federal government should focus on finding more opportunities to stay out of the way.  At the hearing, . It is in the best interest of all to promote policies that reduce the federal imprint on state and local governments and encourage these institutions to address an increasing number of our nation&#8217;s domestic policy concerns. One-size-fits-all policies from bureaucrats sitting here in Washington do little to solve problems or address needs in Arkansas&#8217;s Third Congressional District or any other location far outside the Beltway. I thank Secretary Walther for his testimony and time.  I then sat down with Ferra Aerospace, an advanced machining and complex assembly company that is opening a facility in Rogers. Ferra's Arkansas facility will provide services to many leading companies including Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. I am thrilled that Ferra Aerospace is establishing a precision manufacturing facility in the Third District. The engineering and manufacturing talent in our region is second to none, and it&#8217;s notable that this global aerospace company is expanding into the Natural State. I welcome Ferra and its leadership to Rogers and look forward to working together to create jobs, grow the local economy, and support our military and defense industries. I wrapped up the week by sitting down with Brynt Parmeter, Walmart&#8217;s new Senior Director of Military Programs. Walmart is committed to supporting service members and their families, providing strong military spouse programs and veteran hiring commitments.&nbsp;Since launching&nbsp;the Military Spouse Career Connection (MSCC) on Veterans Day 2018, Walmart has hired more than 14,000 military spouses and remains ahead of schedule to meet its goal of hiring 250,000 military veterans by the end of 2020. Leadership, integrity, and commitment to service make our veterans outstanding employees. I&#8217;m pleased that many companies in AR-3 make it a priority to help service members transition back into civilian life and find new careers that leverage their skills.  Wishing you a great weekend, and I hope to see you around the Third District next week!

As a result, this week I became a cosponsor of the bipartisan Bill&#8217;s Promise Act, legislation that would direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of how individuals on pre-trial release are monitored at the federal, state, and local levels. Under New York State&#8217;s new bail reform policy, cash bail is not required for most defendants accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felonies including those arrested for drug possession, or even many property crimes like theft and burglary. Instead, the law encourages alternatives such as supervision by a pretrial services agency. This bill addresses issues surrounding pretrial release programs in New York State and ensures communities are not put at risk. This legislation was carefully developed with input from both the law enforcement and anti-violence advocacy communities. I am proud to cosponsor this bill to address dangerous bail reform policies that continue to put our communities at risk. This legislation will require an assessment of failed bail reform laws exactly like the one that Governor Cuomo has implemented in New York, which has had significant impacts in the North Country and put many communities at risk. I stand united with local law enforcement and various members of our communities against these harmful bail reform policies and look forward to working with my colleagues to moving this legislation forward. Read more here.  Helping the House Pass Legislation Protecting Older Workers from Discrimination    This week, I crossed the aisle and voted in favor of the bipartisan Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination (POWADA) Act.&nbsp; The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) was enacted in 1967 to prohibit discrimination against older workers, but the 2009 Supreme Court decision Gross v. FBL Financial Services weakened federal protections and made it more difficult for workers to prove age discrimination. This bill amends the ADEA to clarify that proven age discrimination may not play any role in employment decisions, reasserting the pre-2009 standard. I was proud to cosponsor this important bipartisan legislation through its passage in the House. With one of the largest constituencies of seniors in the country, I have heard directly from my constituents who have been affected by age discrimination in the workplace. This bill levels the playing field for older workers by restoring the pre-2009 standards for age discrimination claims, giving our North Country seniors a fair chance and encouraging equal and ethical workplace behavior. Watch me speak on the House floor in support of this legislation&nbsp;here and above.  Co-leading the American Innovation and&nbsp; Manufacturing Leadership Act   I am proud to be co-leading the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, legislation sponsored by Reps. Paul Tonko, Pete Olson, and Scott Peters. This legislation will support the manufacturing of next generation technologies, including refrigerants, solvents, fire suppressants, foam blowing agents, aerosols, and propellants. It implements a phasedown of hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HFC) products, by 85 percent over 15 years, due to their high global warming potential. The bill also directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement an allowance and trading program to replace HFC products, and to establish standards governing the management of HFCs used as refrigerants, including to recover and reclaim old HFC products. These new standards are estimated to create 33,000 new U.S. manufacturing jobs and expand U.S. exports in this sector by 25 percent. This legislation will bring innovation to our manufacturing and technology industries. It will create jobs and boost our manufacturing economy, but also phase out the use of environmentally harmful refrigerants. By keeping American technology and manufacturing at the forefront of this shift in the global market, we can continue our leadership in developing and exporting climate-friendly technologies to world.

Helping House Pass Bill to Improve Veterans' Dental Care    This week, I was proud to&nbsp;help the House pass a bill to provide a waiver for the VA to begin a pilot program to improve dental care access and services for enrolled veterans who are currently ineligible. This bill would allow the VA to work with the American Dental Association and Federally Qualified Health Centers across the U.S. to offer pro bono and discounted dental services to veterans. As the Representative for more veterans than any other district in New York State, I am honored to work to improve their lives each day in Congress. Our veterans put their lives on the line for our freedom &#8211; we must ensure they have the ability to receive comprehensive health care through the VA. I was proud to deliver this bipartisan result for our veterans, and I applaud the House for coming together to pass this important legislation. Read more here.  Sending a Letter Outlining Great Lakes Task Force Priorities to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  This week, I sent a letter to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) requesting critical funding for the Great Lakes region be considered as the USACE develops its work plan for fiscal year 2020. The letter requests that the USACE include funding for projects to keep Asian carp, an invasive fish species, from reaching the Great Lakes, and additional funding for the construction of barriers to prevent their spread. The letter also outlines the need for funding for the new construction of the Soo Locks, which is an important component of national defense and commerce. Additionally, the letter requests both a Great Lakes Coastal Resilience Study and a Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration project be funded in order to develop a coordinated strategy to protect the Great Lakes and its coastline, in coordination with federal, state, and local partners. I am proud to sign onto this letter to support a variety of initiatives and projects that will benefit the Great Lakes region and, ultimately, the St. Lawrence Seaway and Northern New York. As a member of the Great Lakes Task Force, I am committed to requesting the full funding of these projects to protect our waterways from invasive species, preserve important ecosystems, and keep the Great Lakes and the northern border as mechanisms of national defense and commerce. I will continue to advocate in Congress for programs that will support the vibrancy of the St. Lawrence river region. Read more here.  Announcing Significant Funding for Homeless Assistance Programs Across the North Country  This week, I&nbsp;announced Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding totaling $2,473,080 to be awarded to various projects to combat homelessness across Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Jefferson, Lewis, Saratoga, and Warren counties. Some of these projects include homeless veterans housing, domestic violence crisis services, and community housing centers. HUD&#8217;s Continuum of Care grants provide critically needed support to local programs, serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. I was pleased to announce this critical funding for several of our North Country communities in support of their work to combat homelessness. Particularly in rural and isolated areas, these programs are crucial in assisting those who need assistance. I will continue to advocate in support of these programs that play an integral role in our communities. Read more here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!

Elise Stefanik has joined the chorus of New York Republicans who are calling for changes to the state's newly enacted criminal justice reforms, which even some state Democratic leaders acknowledge needs tweaks.  Stefanik on Monday announced her co-sponsorship of legislation that would direct the Government Accountability Office to assess how individuals on pre-trial release programs are monitored at the federal, state and local levels and ensure communities are not being put at risk.  &#8220;I am proud to co-sponsor this bill to address dangerous bail reform policies that continue to put our communities at risk,&#8221; Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said in a statement. &#8220;This legislation will require an assessment of failed bail reform laws exactly like the one that Gov. (Andrew M.) Cuomo has implemented in New York, which has had significant impacts in the North Country and put many communities at risk.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;I stand united with local law enforcement and various members of our communities against these harmful bail reform policies and look forward to working with my colleagues to moving this legislation forward,&#8221; Stefanik said.&nbsp;&nbsp;  _________________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

Durbin                                       Fellow Illinoisan,  Last week, I was proud to announce my support for the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or&nbsp;USMCA,&nbsp;which&nbsp;updates&nbsp;the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. While not perfect, Democrats were able to secure important changes - including enforceable labor protections - that make the&nbsp;USMCA&nbsp;a win for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers.  It is also a win for Illinois.&nbsp;  Illinois is the sixth largest exporting state in the U.S., and Mexico and Canada are our largest export partners. Nearly $28 billion of Illinois products went to these countries in 2018. And these markets have continually grown over the past ten years - Illinois exports to Canada have increased by 46 percent since 2009, while exports to Mexico have increased by 187 percent.   DURBIN ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR USMCA TRADE DEAL  Illinois&#8217; success in exporting its products depends on fair trade agreements that level the playing field for Illinois workers, manufacturers, and farmers. The USMCA will do just that, supporting Illinois jobs and ensuring that our exports can continue to grow and thrive in these markets.  The USMCA will also help maintain strong markets for Illinois&#8217; agricultural products well into the future, providing much-needed certainty for our farmers and creating jobs that are essential to rural economies across the state.&nbsp;  While no agreement is perfect and I am disappointed the agreement did not include stronger provisions to address climate change, I believe that the USMCA will bring NAFTA into the 21st century and set important standards for our economic success. I&#8217;m proud to support this agreement, which will grow jobs and support our economy at home in Illinois.&nbsp;  Sincerely,&nbsp;  U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)  &nbsp;                                           &nbsp;  &nbsp;Click here to open a plain text version of this email&nbsp; &nbsp; Click here to forward this email&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click here to comment on this email   ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Democrat","score":2.4139705},{"name":"Congressman Tom McClintock","address":"ca04tmima@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-01-15","subject":"January E-News","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }       &nbsp;                             HOME | NEWSROOM | ISSUES | VOTES &amp; LEGISLATION | CONSTITUENT SERVICES | ABOUT | CONTACT             &nbsp;        E-News  Impeachment of the President  Congressman McClintock is a member of the House Judiciary Committee. The committee held hearings on Articles of Impeachment, where the Congressman discussed the impeachment issue and delivered remarks in opposition.  The Congressman's Speeches in the House of Representatives on Impeachment can be found here.&nbsp;   Reflections on the War Powers Debate The Congressman delivered remarks on the House floor discussing the recent War Powers debate:  House Chamber, Washington, D.C.January 10, 2020 Mr. Speaker: Throughout the debate yesterday on the so-called war powers resolution, some fundamental misunderstandings surfaced that I feel need to be addressed. The first misunderstanding is that the justification for the attack that killed Soleimani was that he was an evil terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. There are a lot of evil terrorists out there, but that doesn&#8217;t give the President authority to launch attacks on foreign countries to kill them.  What DID give the President that authority in this case was the fact that Soleimani was acting as an armed combatant against U.S. forces in a war zone in which Congress had authorized the President to take military action when it adopted the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Iraq in 2002. I hate to shock my woke colleagues but killing active enemy combatants is what war is all about. And it is a war that Congress started with that act.            \"That is a legitimate debate to have &#8211; but that&#8217;s not what the House did yesterday...\" (click to watch)        That act provides \"The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to &#8230; defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.&#8221; The very nature of this authority includes combatting hostile militia and armed proxies acting within Iraq against American forces. That is exactly what the President did. The authorization to use military force didn&#8217;t end with the defeat of Saddam Hussein any more than the president&#8217;s military authority in Japan and Germany ended with the defeat of Hirohito and Hitler. In those cases, the President&#8217;s authority didn&#8217;t terminate until 1952 and 1955 respectively, and the President&#8217;s military authority in Iraq remains in effect until the President and Congress terminate it.  The second misunderstanding is that the President&#8217;s action was an attack on Iran. It most certainly was not. It was carried out in the theater of war defined by Congress against a combatant who was commanding hostile forces against American troops. Not only did the President act entirely within his legal authority as commander-in-chief, but within his moral responsibility to protect American military and diplomatic personnel and American citizens in Iraq. The third misunderstanding is that the War Powers Act is applicable in this circumstance. The War Powers Act governs only those circumstances when the President responds WITHOUT congressional authority to an attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions or its armed forces. In this case, the President already HAD congressional authority. The fourth misunderstanding is that the attack on Soleimani was equivalent to President Obama&#8217;s attack on Libya. These are two entirely different matters. The attack on Libya had no congressional authorization and the War Powers Act was not applicable because Mr. Obama&#8217;s military attack was not in response to an attack on the United States, its territory or possessions or its armed forces. It was entirely unprovoked, entirely unauthorized and accordingly, it was entirely illegal. We need to get back to some basic understandings about the constitutional parameters of war powers. The American Founders made a sharp distinction between starting a war and waging a war, for some very good reasons. They understood that this most solemn and lethal decision should not be entrusted to one individual whose authority would be greatly augmented by it. The decision to start a war was given exclusively to Congress to assure that every voice in the country was heard and that Congress, having taken that stand, would be obligated to put the resources of the country behind that war and those fighting it. But once the war is begun, the Founders wanted a single commander-in-chief directing it with clear and unambiguous authority. There is no surer path to military disaster than having 535 squabbling prima donnas second-guessing every decision being made.  Thus, the President can wage war but cannot declare it and the Congress can declare war but cannot wage it.  The Founders debated these principles thoroughly during the Constitutional Convention. They recognized that the President needed certain residual military power to repel an attack when Congress could not act. I believe The War Powers Act faithfully defines these circumstances and establishes a framework to contain them.  But the War Powers Act does not give the President the authority to launch military attacks EXCEPT in response to a direct attack on our country &#8211; nor can it limit the President&#8217;s authority as commander-in-chief once Congress DOES authorize war.  I believe the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Iraq was a colossal mistake. It created a dangerous power vacuum, it was never supported with the full resources of the United States, and it was without provocation.  But there should be no re-writing of history here. It may have been George W. Bush who advocated for the war and Bush, Obama and now President Trump who have waged it -- but it was Congress&#8217; adoption of the AUMF that formally started it.  And once started, only the President can wage it. President Trump inherited this mess and history will judge how well he handles it. Certainly, in this instance, the President not only had unmistakable authority to order the attack, he had a moral imperative to do so to. What is crystal clear from the debate yesterday that if the Democrats had their way, Soleimani would be alive today and the attack on American troops that he was in the final stages of planning would have unfolded. We would likely today be mourning the loss of very many American lives.  If the President, knowing that the attack was coming, and in full possession of the opportunity and authority to stop it, had taken the Democrats&#8217; advice and done nothing, he would have been deeply culpable for the loss of those Americans. It is shocking that even in hindsight, this is the course the Democrats have made clear that they would have taken.  Which brings me to the nature of the resolution the House passed yesterday. The separation of war powers between the legislative and executive branches has been badly blurred in recent decades, and I do believe we need to re-establish not only the constitutional principles that separate the declaring of war from the waging of war, but also the American tradition that we go to war only when we have been attacked. And when we must go to war, we have the utmost obligation to put the entire might, resources and attention of the nation behind it and get it over with as quickly as possible.  That is a legitimate debate to have &#8211; but that&#8217;s not what the House did yesterday. Yesterday, it deliberately and recklessly undermined the position of the United States government and the United States armed forces that we sent to Iraq, shredding the tradition that politics stops at the waters edge. At a perilous moment, the House refused to stand behind the war that it had authorized in 2002, refused to protect the men and women that it placed in harm&#8217;s way and gave a hostile foreign power a major propaganda victory. That is yet another stain upon the honor of this House, and one which should be deplored and condemned through the ages to come.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    District Conference Call  Congressman McClintock hosts conference calls with constituents to discuss a variety of issues pending before Congress.

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Update Regarding Aviation &amp; Aerospace Industry in WichitaWichita would not be the Air Capital of the World without the extraordinary engineers, designers and manufacturers who have invested in our aviation industry and made Wichita their home. The&nbsp;layoffs announced&nbsp;last week at Spirit AeroSystems have dealt a harsh blow not only to the company but also to Spirit suppliers and subcontractors. Over the past week, I have had conversations with both the incoming CEO at Boeing and the FAA Administrator to encourage them to work together and do everything necessary to get the 737 MAX safely back in the air. I will work with business leaders and Administration officials to do everything possible to see that this is a short-term impact to the aviation and aerospace industry in Wichita.  &nbsp;  Speaking with President Trump and Vice President Pence  I recently spoke with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence regarding the impact the layoffs at Spirit AeroSystems will have on Kansas and throughout the aviation industry. I explained to them the unique importance the Boeing 737 MAX has to Wichita, and they assured me they will work with their teams to see if there are ways that the administration can be of help. We also discussed future opportunities to bring additional Department of Defense jobs to the area.  &nbsp;  Touring Cox Machine, Inc. in Wichita  Producing a 737 MAX requires a supply chain of businesses, contractors, engineers, designers and manufacturers across the country, and Wichita &#150; the Air Capital of the World &#150; is a vital link in that supply chain. The decision to halt production of the 737 MAX dealt a blow to businesses like Cox Machine, Inc., a Wichita company with more than 300 employees.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  On Thursday, I visited Cox Machine, Inc. to learn how they are impacted by Boeing&#8217;s decision. We discussed the importance of workforce development, keeping talent in the region and the need for a timeline on the 737 MAX in order for businesses in the supply chain to plan accordingly. We also discussed both of my conversations with the incoming CEO at Boeing David Calhoun and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Stephen Dickson aimed at encouraging a quick and safe resolution on the future of the 737 MAX and to stress how important the aviation and aerospace industry is to Kansas. In addition, we discussed my efforts with the Department of Defense to showcase the capabilities of Wichita manufacturers in an effort to bring more job opportunities to the region.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Speaking with Both Boeing and the FAA On Tuesday, I discussed the future of the Boeing 737 MAX with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator, Stephen Dickson, and the incoming CEO of Boeing, David Calhoun. The decision to halt production of the 737 MAX has dealt a devastating blow not only to businesses like Spirit AeroSystems, but a number of suppliers and contractors in the Wichita area. During our conversations, I stressed the importance of the aircraft to the region and encouraged a quick and safe resolution regarding the future of the 737 MAX without a compromise to safety. In addition, I will continue to work with the Department of Defense to showcase the capabilities of Wichita manufacturers in an effort to bring more job opportunities to the region.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Confirmed as Chairman of the Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs CommitteeThis week, I had the distinct privilege of being confirmed as the 12th Chairman of the Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee. During my time in Congress &#150; as both a member of the House and Senate Committees on Veterans&#8217; Affairs &#150; I have made improving the quality of life for veterans across the country a top priority, including the nearly 200,000 veterans living in Kansas. There is no group of people I hold in higher regard than those who serve our nation, and I take seriously the responsibility of providing our veterans with the best our country has to offer. I have always relied on veterans to help drive policy decisions in Washington, and I will continue to look to those who have served for ideas and solutions to improve the lives of their fellow servicemembers. As chairman, I am committed to ensuring our veterans have the right resources at the right time to achieve success after service. To veterans in Kansas and millions of veterans across the country: I work to serve and honor you. Please read more about my priorities as chairman in the Kansas City Star article&nbsp;here.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer On Tuesday, I met with United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and Deputy USTR C.J. Mahoney, who is a native of Russell and served as one of my first interns in Congress. We discussed the phase one trade deal with China, which includes a commitment by China to purchase at least $40 billion annually in agricultural products from the United States each of the next two years and addresses much of China&#8217;s misbehavior on trade. The increase in agricultural purchases by China will help the struggling farm economy across the country and in Kansas. We also discussed USMCA and the benefits that the agreement contains for Kansas, Mexico and Canada, our two largest trading partners. This modern trade deal is vital to our farmers, ranchers and manufacturers. This week, USMCA passed out of the Senate Finance Committee, putting it one step closer to Senate approval. This is great news, and I continue to urge Senate leadership and my colleagues to move quickly to bring this important trade agreement to the full Senate. On January 3, I&nbsp;requested&nbsp;that Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer quickly move USMCA forward and bring it to a vote on the Senate floor before impeachment proceedings. USMCA received 385 votes in the House of Representatives in December, showing that the agreement is overwhelmingly bipartisan. As the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees USTR, I will continue working with Ambassador Lighthizer on restoring trade with China while holding China accountable for their behavior. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get USMCA across the finish line. &nbsp;    Meeting with K-State Polytechnic Aviation Students On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet with aviation students from Kansas State Polytechnic who were in D.C. to attend the University Aviation Association&#8217;s 2020 Annual Aviation Policy Seminar. This annual seminar offers aviation students from around the world the opportunity to come to our nation&#8217;s capital to speak with members of Congress as well as representatives of agencies like the FAA or National Transportation Safety Board. These conversations allowed the K-State&nbsp;students, most of whom are studying to become pilots, to develop a better understanding of the process by which laws and regulations are created as well as ways they can be active in the process. As the future of aviation, I would like to thank these students for taking time out of their holiday break to come to D.C. and engage in our democracy. A special thanks to their instructor Dr. Austin Walden for arranging the trip and bringing them to meet with me.    &nbsp;  Attending Topeka&#8217;s McDonald&#8217;s Ribbon Cutting  On Thursday evening, I attended the ribbon cutting of the new McDonald&#8217;s restaurant on South Topeka Boulevard. It was great to surprise the Dobski family at the grand opening and catch up with many friends from the Topeka area.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Visiting Butler County  I was in Butler County this week for a Kansas Listening Tour Stop and was able to talk with folks about education in rural communities, the role of small town banks and what is going on in Washington, D.C. Special thanks to Circle Benton Elementary School Principal Robert Leis and the folks at Towanda State Bank, including President Aaron Lehman and Receptionist Loretta Lehman, for our conversations.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

Further, it is an honor to announce those students from Virginia's Sixth District who I have nominated to U.S. Service Academies. These individuals are prepared to serve our country and defend our freedoms overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Iran and War Powers&nbsp;  Iran is the leading sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers and thousands of civilians around the world. Further, Gen. Soleimani was the leading architect of Iran&#8217;s global terror strategy, including the&nbsp;killing of an American working in&nbsp;Iraq and the attack on our embassy in Baghdad. I commend President Trump for taking strong and decisive action to eliminate the terror leader, Soleimani, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;protect our troops and defend American interests.  Unfortunately, Democrats chose to politicize&nbsp;this issue and passed a resolution to attack the President and&nbsp;limit&nbsp;his powers to defend us from further aggression by Iran.&nbsp;Even though the bill is not binding, it recklessly hinders President Trump's&nbsp;ability to use force against an enemy who only last week&nbsp;attacked U.S. interests. Not only does this resolution jeopardize our national security, but it also puts our troops and our allies in harm&#8217;s way moving forward.  Instead of a debate about the question of the separation of powers, H. Con. Res. 83 condemns the President&#8217;s appropriate reasoned response to Iranian aggression. While only Congress can declare war, it is necessary for the President to be able to respond in a swift manner to defend American interests and our men and women in uniform.  Town Halls  As a Member of Congress, a top priority of mine is to be accessible to the constituents of the Sixth District. For this reason, I have made a commitment to hold town halls throughout the District to ensure I can hear first-hand from those I represent and bring their views back to Washington. Prior to the new year, I hosted nineteen town halls &#8211; one in each locality &#8211; and plan to continue holding events like these throughout my term. Already in 2020, I have hosted three such forums in Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Botetourt County. I look forward to meeting with as many residents as possible in the coming year and encourage all constituents to visit my Facebook page, website, and keep an eye on their local newspaper for town hall announcements coming in the near future.         Service Academy Nominations: One of the greatest honors I have serving as the Representative for Virginia's Sixth District is the privilege of nominating high school seniors to one of four United States Service Academies. Applicants to the U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy require a recommendation from a Member of Congress or another nominating authority. Understanding the seriousness of this responsibility, I spent&nbsp;the past several months traveling the District meeting individually with each interested applicant. The passion for service and love of country that these students exuded was truly inspiring, and I am pleased to announce the names of those I have nominated to each academy. Congratulations and best of luck throughout the rest of the admissions process.&nbsp;  United States Naval Academy:  Ashleigh Dickman, senior at Skyline High School and a resident of Front Royal&nbsp;  Noah Harding, senior at Hidden Valley High School and a resident of Roanoke&nbsp; Stephen Hanley, completed his first semester at VMI and a resident of Stuarts Draft  Brian Hayden, senior at Cave Spring High School and a resident of Roanoke  Joseph Kilgallen, senior at Warren County High School and a resident of Front Royal  Liesel Nelson, senior at Rockbridge High School and a resident of Lexington  Alexander Plonsky,&nbsp;senior at Fort Defiance High School and a resident of Weyers Cave  Ryan Scott, completed first semester at Hampden-Sydney and a resident of Roanoke  Andrew Wheeler,&nbsp;senior at Cave Spring High School and a resident of Roanoke  United States Military Academy:&nbsp;  Bryce Corkery,&nbsp;senior at William Byrd High School and a resident of Vinton  Revely Keesee,&nbsp;senior at Jefferson Forest High School and a resident of Forest  Erin Wienke,&nbsp;senior at William Byrd High School and a resident of Vinton  United States Air Force Academy:  Jacqueline Kelly,&nbsp;senior at Seton Home Study School and a resident of Front Royal&nbsp;  Ezra Paul, senior in a home school program and a resident of Rockingham  John Shelor,&nbsp;senior at Cave Spring High School a and resident of Boones Mill  United States Merchant Marine Academy:  Daniel Pettyjohn, senior at Brookville High School and a resident of Forest&nbsp;         FCS Championship Game:  I congratulate North Dakota State on their victory in the FCS Football Championship yesterday.&nbsp;The Dukes put up a heck of a fight, but unfortunately fell just short.

I hope you had a great time ringing in the new decade with your friends and loved ones. When reflecting on the past year, I'm proud of what I've accomplished together.&nbsp; As a new year begins, it&#8217;s time to hit the ground running. I wanted to give you an update on what I've been doing to start 2020.   Protecting Americans Against Terrorism Last week marked a momentous occasion in our nation&#8217;s recent history, when President Trump green-lit a targeted strike to take out Iranian General Soleimani, the leader of Iran's military terrorist unit responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans. Iran retaliated with attacks on American servicemembers stationed in Iraq. I&#8217;m thankful that no American blood was shed during these attacks and continue to pray for our men and women in uniform. The President sent a strong message to the world &#8211; the United States stands against terrorism and a nuclear Iran. However, in an unprecedented attempt to tie the President&#8217;s hands, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats unfortunately passed a War Powers Resolution, an irresponsible move that makes it harder for the President and brave men and women in uniform to do their jobs and keep our nation safe. I voted against this resolution, and hope that the Senate will as well.   Putting an End to Veteran Suicide Every day, our country tragically loses 20 veterans to suicide, a crisis that continues to grow despite efforts by the VA to intervene. Twenty a day is 20 too many, and something must be done to end this crisis plaguing the veteran community. I am proud to tell you that a bipartisan bill I introduced, the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act, was recently signed into law by the President. This new law will ensure that Suicide Prevention Coordinators &#8211; the VA professionals who identify veterans at risk for suicide &#8211; have the tools they need to support vulnerable veterans.&nbsp;Working together, we can help ensure veterans have the resources they need during their time of need and let them know that they are not alone.      Compensating Blue Water Navy Veterans After the Vietnam War, almost 100,000 Blue Water Navy veterans became ill due to exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides during their service. Last year, a bill I cosponsored to ensure these veterans receive proper benefits was signed into law. If you are a Vietnam veteran who was impacted by Agent Orange exposure, I have some important information for you. The VA is now adjudicating claims for disability compensation and other benefits related to Agent Orange exposure. All Blue Water Navy veterans can apply, even if you have been previously denied.

With Scott Air Force Base in our back yard, it's easy to see why service to our nation is an important value within the communities in Illinois's 12th District.&nbsp;Every year, I'm honored to nominate a select number of Southern Illinois' best and brightest to our nation&#8217;s service academies. I recently held a ceremony to thank this year&#8217;s nominees for their patriotism and celebrate their hard work. As our next generation of leaders, they have incredibly bright futures ahead.     The Partisan Impeachment Drags On This impeachment process has become so long and drawn out that even Democrats have had enough. For months, Speaker Pelosi has been saying that impeachment is an urgent national interest. Yet, she has withheld the articles of impeachment from the Senate for over three weeks.&nbsp;Members of both sides of the aisle can see straight through the games and it's time to move on and work on issues that actually impact Americans.   It's been a great start to the year, and I'm optimistic about the direction we're heading. Hope you have a great week!  -Mike                    WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 1440 Longworth HouseOffice BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-5661Fax: (202) 225-0285 O'FALLON OFFICE 302 West State St.O'Fallon, IL 62269Phone: (618) 622-0766Fax: (618) 622-0774 CARBONDALE OFFICE 300 East Main StreetSuite 4&nbsp;Carbondale, IL 62901Phone: (618) 457-5787Fax: (618) 457-2990          Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window | Click here to open a plain text version of this email Unsubscribe&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;          ","district":"12","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Republican","score":2.0593143},{"name":"Joni K.

President Trump&#8217;s decisive action sent a clear, strong message to Iran: there are consequences for crossing a red line. As someone who&#8217;s worn our nation&#8217;s uniform, and served as a company commander in Iraq, I&#8217;m confident in the capabilities of our military and intelligence personnel, and I commend them for their ongoing efforts in the region. I joined both Varney &amp; Co. and Outnumbered Overtime to discuss my reactions to President Trump&#8217;s maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime.

We must do better for the Iowans, and all Americans, who choose to serve and protect our country. This week, I teamed up with another member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, to introduce a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing sexual assault and retaliation in the United States Coast Guard.   Click here or the image above to read an article on my efforts.   Calling on Speaker Pelosi to Stop Playing Politics and to Let Us Get Back to Work for Iowans  When I was back home in Iowa over the holidays, I heard from Iowans about how they are fed up with impeachment&#151;the political exercise that&#8217;s slowing Congress down from getting important things done, like passing the USMCA &#150; a trade deal that will create over 175,000 jobs across this country.  Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have been trying to impeach President Trump since day one, and now after voting on the articles, she&#8217;s stalling. This week, I joined my colleagues to introduce a resolution to set a 25 day timetable for Speaker Pelosi to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, so we can get back to the people&#8217;s business.    Thank You to All of Iowa&#8217;s Men and Women in Law Enforcement  Thursday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. I want to thank Iowa&#8217;s law enforcement professionals for everything they do to keep our great state safe.    As we go about our busy lives, it&#8217;s often easy to take for granted the sacrifices our law enforcement officials make day-in and day-out to keep our communities safe. If you haven&#8217;t yet, please take a moment to show just how much we appreciate their efforts to look after our friends, neighbors, and loved ones.
