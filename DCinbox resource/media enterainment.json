This industry supports 685,000 jobs in our nation, and I was honored to be joined by several of my colleagues to express our concern and support for this hardworking industry.

It has been a busy two weeks in Washington! I appreciate you taking the time to read my E-Newsletter to stay up-to-date on everything happening in the House of Representatives and back in the district.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;President Trump Delivers State of the Union Address&nbsp;  Last week, President Trump laid out a bold vision forward for our country and highlighted the numerous successes of his administration. Our nation has truly experienced a blue-collar boom, with strong year-over-year wage growth and record low unemployment.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice President Pence Visits Lancaster!  It was great to join Vice President Mike Pence for a community leaders roundtable in Lancaster and to hear directly from the people their thoughts about what is happening in Washington. Thanks for the lift back to Washington, aboard Air Force 2!    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Prayer Breakfast  It was great to join so many for the National Prayer Breakfast last week. I had the honor of being joined by Pastor Matt Mylin and his wife Kelly, who lead the congregation at the Worship Center in Leola, PA. The morning featured an uplifting message from keynote speaker Arthur Brooks.       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Floor &nbsp;  This past week, I had the opportunity to speak from the floor of the House to honor two community leaders and to oppose legislation which would harm American workers.  I spoke out against the PRO Act, which is a massive giveaway to union special interests and would have drastically changed the balance of labor laws in favor of unions and against American workers. Click here to watch my remarks on the PRO Act. Additionally, I spoke on the House floor to honor the life of Mr. Robert Aichele, a community leader in Lancaster County, who passed away at the age of 92 last week. Click here to watch my comments honoring the memory of Mr. Aichele.  I also spoke on the House floor to give thanks to Dr. William Griscom, who has recently retired after serving as President of Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology for 23 years. Thousands of lives across south central Pennsylvania have been put on the path to success because of his leadership.

I also announced $4.5 million worth of funding to modernize and expand outdated locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.    Congresswoman Bustos signing legislation to create the Rural Health Liaison.  Health care is the number one issue I hear about from folks back home and in rural communities, access to care can present unique challenges. That&#8217;s why I was proud that on Friday the USDA appointed the first-ever Rural Health Liaison after I passed legislation to create the role. It&#8217;s crucial we ensure small towns across the Heartland have access to 21st Century health care and that&#8217;s what this position will help do. I remain committed to lowering health care costs and improving access, and I look forward to working with our first Rural Health Liaison. You can learn more here.  Then, I joined Senators Durbin and Duckworth to announce $4.5 million worth of funding to improve our locks and dams along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Our inland waterways are responsible for moving more than 600 million tons of goods each year, including agricultural products, but outdated locks and dams could bring this local economic driver to a standstill. This funding will help increase our region&#8217;s competitive edge, promote efficiency and support our local economy. Read more about it here.  Finally, I was proud to vote in favor of women&#8217;s equality when I helped pass a bipartisan resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline Congress previously set to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. With this vote, we take another step forward to guarantee fundamental rights for all and place the ERA on a path to becoming a part of our Constitution.

Bost                  The Bost Bulletin Friend,  As we celebrate Presidents' Day tomorrow, it's important to note the impact each president has had on our nation's history, including Illinois' own Abraham Lincoln. His dedication to freedom is a shining example of the values our country represents. Here's what I've been up to this week.   Protecting Our Children in Schools Having the Securing Our Schools Act, a bill I introduced, signed into law by the President is one of my proudest achievements while serving in Congress. This law created the School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) to provide law enforcement with the appropriate tools and technology they need to make classrooms safer. Starting this week, the SVPP is accepting applications through April 8, 2020 for this year&#8217;s round of grant funding. For more information, please visit here. As a former first responder, I encourage local government leaders, school administrators, and law enforcement to apply ASAP!  Safeguarding Veteran Votes Ensuring Americans have a say in who leads our government is a right our veterans overseas fight for every day. Too often, however, our men and women serving across the world are unable to have their absentee ballots arrive to the States on time for the collection deadline.This is completely unacceptable, which is why I am proud to tell you that I have cosponsored the Counting All Military Votes Act to improve voting accessibility for American active duty service members. Our military men and women overseas are committed to keeping American diplomats and citizens safe and deserve peace of mind knowing that their ballot will be counted in a timely manner.     Empowering the Postal Service Since its creation in 1775, the USPS has remained one of the most reliable government agencies. In fact, it is one of the few explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution. Today, the USPS employs over 600,000 workers and continues to be an integral function of our government and economy. However, due to a mandate passed over a decade ago, the USPS is obligated to pre-fund its future pensions, losing the agency millions of dollars every year. I'm proud to tell you that legislation I cosponsored, the USPS Fairness Act, passed the House last week. This bill will make sure that employees within the USPS will receive the same retiree health funding benefits that apply to all other federal agencies and allow the USPS to invest in itself for the first time in years.  Prior to its passage, I spoke on the House Floor in support of this legislation. To hear my remarks, please click the link below.     Sending Valentines for Veterans On Thursday, I joined my colleagues in writing Valentine's Day messages to be sent to veterans living in the Washington, D.C. area. Veterans selflessly signed up to defend the freedoms of our great country without asking for anything in return. As a Marine and father of a Marine, I was honored to take part in this small gesture of appreciation for those who have served our nation.    Protecting Correctional Officers Our district is home to United States Penitentiary Marion, but like many facilities, it is not staffed at the proper level. Studies show that understaffed facilities have more assaults against workers and more inmate suicides. Recently, I led a letter asking the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide the Bureau of Prisons with direct-hiring authority, which would allow individual facilities to hire the staff they need on their own timelines.&nbsp;This week, I was honored to accept the Legislative Appreciation Award from the Council of Prison Locals for my work on this issue and will continue to make sure the safety of correctional facility staff and inmates is a top priority.&nbsp;     Investing in Illinois Waterways I met with Illinois members of the Waterways Council to discuss the funding and maintenance of our system of inland waterways and ports. With millions of tons of cargo transported on the Mississippi River every year, this issue is one of my top priorities. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will continue to make sure Southern Illinois's waterways are taken care of.     Meeting with Southern Illinois Community Colleges Earlier in the week, I had the chance to meet with Interim President Dr. Kathleen Curphy and Don Patton with Shawnee Community College as well as several administrators and trustees from John A. Logan Community College to discuss access to grants, lowering costs of tuition, and bolstering job training for career and technical education (CTE) programs. As a member of the Congressional CTE Caucus, I will continue to support these critically important programs.   It was a productive week here in Washington, with a schedule jam-packed full of meeting with folks from across our district. I&#8217;m looking forward being back in Southern Illinois for our district work week.  I hope you enjoy Presidents' Day tomorrow and are able to relax and reflect on the blessings in your life. Enjoy your week!  -Mike                  Unsubscribe    ","district":"12","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Republican","score":2.4607167},{"name":"Rep.

As I said on the House floor, I am an equal to every one of my male colleagues in Congress until I walk out the door and down the steps of the Capitol. Then I am relegated to second-class status because women are not recognized in the Constitution as fully equal to men under the law. Thursday&#8217;s vote on H.J.Res.79, my resolution to facilitate ratification of the ERA, was a vote for equality, the American dream, and that more perfect union. I am proud of House Democrats, and five of our Republican colleagues,&nbsp;who&nbsp;joined me in championing&nbsp;the fight for women&#8217;s rights and greater equality. House Democrats also continued our work to protect our environment and natural spaces with a sweeping wilderness protection bill, and we voted to establish the first museum in the United States dedicated to the celebration and recognition of women&#8217;s history. We also turned the spotlight on threats to our nation with the&nbsp;Military Personnel Committee hearing that I chaired and that focused on the rise of white supremacy in our military, the House Armed Services Committee hearing on the malign actions of foreign adversaries including Russia and China, and my work to expose and eradicate the corrosive effects of sexual assault on our brave servicemembers &#8211; which threatens unit cohesion and military readiness. I was proud to introduce a resolution with Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA)&nbsp;to establish an international anti-corruption court&nbsp;to address the impact that corruption has on&nbsp;human rights worldwide and the challenge of holding kleptocrats accountable for their crimes, and much more as you will read below. I am looking forward&nbsp;to being home in the 14th District this coming week. Then it&#8217;s back to Washington, DC the week of February 24th, and a return of Jackie&#8217;s DC Dashboard, so be sure to keep an eye out for the next update.                   As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

By 1982, 35 states out of the required 38 states voted to ratify the amendment. In the past three years, grassroots campaigns have successfully secured the final ratification votes in Nevada, Illinois, and most recently, Virginia. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel recently put out a legal opinion that the current ERA push is dead and that Congress lacks the authority to revive it. The Archivist, who is responsible for certifying amendments to the Constitution once ratified by three-fourths of the states, has decided to follow DOJ&#8217;s guidance even though Article V makes clear the Executive has no role in the Constitutional amendment process. Our vote to eliminate the arbitrary deadline brings us closer to placing this important guarantee of women&#8217;s equality in our founding document. It is now up to the Senate to follow suit and vote on companion legislation by Senators Murkowski and Cardin, and the Archivist to move forward with certifying the ERA.  Voted for Sweeping Wilderness Bill This week, the House took a major step toward protecting our public lands by voting to designate almost 1.4 million acres of land as wilderness and adding 1,000 river miles to the National Wild and Scenic River Systems. H.R. 2546, the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act, would preserve natural spaces in California, Colorado, and Washington for generations to come by protecting them from logging, mining, drilling, and new construction. It would also improve recreational access for underserved communities, safeguard ancestral homelands and tribal access, and boost local economies. Despite the bipartisan House vote, the Senate Majority Mitch McConnell is likely to relegate this critically-needed bill to his legislative graveyard. President Trump has also threatened to veto this legislation if it reaches his desk. But this fight is far from over. Our public lands are our most important natural heritage and an important tool in the fight against climate change. House Democrats will continue to push for wilderness and environmental protections as Americans across the continue to demand action this election year. Voted to Create a Smithsonian Women&#8217;s History Museum On Tuesday, House Democrats passed H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women&#8217;s History Museum Act. This bipartisan legislation would establish a Smithsonian museum dedicated to women&#8217;s history on the National Mall. Currently, we do not have a comprehensive museum in America documenting women&#8217;s history. Without it, women&#8217;s contributions to the nation are too often forgotten and could be lost as distant and forgotten memories. The stories of women in this country are too integral to our history to push aside. I was proud to vote for this historic legislation and urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass it so that we can get to work building this museum!    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Chaired MILPERS Hearing on White Supremacists in the Military  There are several warning signs that these efforts have found success. Recent high-profile examples include a Marine attending the 2017 Charlottesville rally, a Coast Guard officer arrested with a cache of weapons, and a West Point graduate espousing hate on social media. It seems that the military is not only not taking this threat seriously enough, it also lacks the tools it needs and has failed to dedicate sufficient resources to fighting this threat. At the hearing, we discussed necessary improvements to the accessions process, how we investigate and punish white supremacist activity in the forces, and how we report and track these individuals after they have been expelled from the military. I look forward to an update from military leadership soon on the progress that they will make in focusing on this issue with the seriousness and commitment that it demands. You can watch the hearing here.  House Armed Services Committee Hearing on Threats Posed by Russia and China This week, I attended the House Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department&#8217;s role in our national efforts to address the threats and challenges posed by Russia and China&#8212;two formidable countries that do not share our values. The DoD is focused on ensuring that the United States is ready to compete with those countries militarily, but at the hearing we discussed the importance of addressing less traditional acts of aggression, such as propaganda operations, cyber-attacks, and predatory economic practices. Countering these threats will require a comprehensive strategy across our government, executed in partnership with our allies.  Spoke on a Panel about Military Sexual Assault&nbsp; On Wednesday night, I attended Heroine, a one-woman show about a female soldier performed at the beautiful Kennedy Center. The play, which is based on a real story, describes a woman&#8217;s struggle with addiction, depression, and suicide after being raped by soldiers in her unit. I was deeply impressed by how the performance conveyed the horror of military sexual assault and lasting pains with which survivors must wrestle. After the play, I sat on a panel with military justice experts to discuss our ongoing efforts to address this issue. As the Chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, I have made eradicating military sexual violence a top priority because our military cannot succeed while battling this scourge within its ranks.&nbsp;    Meetings with Jackie Meeting with Local Veterans Affairs Department Union On Wednesday, I met with leaders of AFGE Local 2110, the union that represents workers at our local VA hospital and clinic. We discussed our ongoing efforts to improve VA locality pay to offset the high cost of living in our area and help the VA recruit and retain staff. The VA representatives also shared the way that the Trump Administration&#8217;s anti-union actions have constrained their ability to operate. I remain committed to helping AFGE as it fights for its members to receive a living wage and fair representation.  Met with Northern California Special Olympics Delegation  Met with the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District On Wednesday I met with representatives of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District (GGBHTD) to discuss opportunities for supporting San Francisco&#8217;s infrastructure needs. The District shared their plans for upcoming federal grant opportunities, and I look forward to lending my support to their work. We discussed the District&#8217;s concerns around the lack of federal funding to California for critical infrastructure needs, such as seismic retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge and expansion of the ferry boat system. I share many of their concerns, especially given President Trump&#8217;s vindictive attitude toward California.  The GGBHTD also provided updates on important projects and policies such as drone restrictions over the bridge, construction of the suicide net, and new safety measures for the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is an icon of the Bay Area as well as a vital piece of infrastructure for the region. I remain committed to supporting GGBHT and the needs of all Bay Area residents.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District  Here are some issues raised this week:   99 constituents expressed support for H.R. 230, the Ban Toxic Pesticides Act of 2019. I am a cosponsor of this crucial piece of legislation that would ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and prohibit any future registration of the pesticide. Please know that I will always fight to protect public health and safety, and ensure that our water, produce, and environment is safe from toxic chemicals. 87 constituents expressed concern with fracking.&nbsp; Like you, I am deeply concerned about the effect of fracking on water sources. I take regulation of hydraulic fracturing seriously and will fight to protect the health and safety of all Americans. I am also deeply committed to supporting clean technology innovation, including solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, advanced biofuels, and other renewable energy sources 27 constituents expressed support for our public lands. Our landscapes and national parks are treasures that must be preserved for future generations. I am proud to have been named a \"Friend of the National Parks,\" and I am committed to conserving our natural heritage.

The EPA released its plan &#8211; the PFAS Action Plan &#8211; one year ago today and has yet to implement many of the commitments outlined in the strategy.&nbsp;   &#8220;As you are aware, communities across the country are struggling to respond to the widespread issue of PFAS contamination,&#8221; said Senator Baldwin and her colleagues.&nbsp;&#8220; The human health risks from this class of chemicals, which include birth defects, various forms of cancer, and immune system dysfunction, are still being examined, and the uncertainty has caused great concern among our constituents.&#8221;   The lawmakers went on to underscore that the PFAS Action Plan alone is insufficient to address the full scope and urgency of the problems associated with PFAS exposure, which is why failure to take an initial step to implement this plan is particularly concerning. They also highlighted that the EPA committed to establishing federal drinking water standards last year for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid&nbsp;(PFOS), two of the most prevalent PFAS chemicals, but have also failed to follow through on that pledge. The Senators closed their letter with a request that the EPA provide an update on the status of every commitment made in the PFAS Action Plan, as well as an update on the timeline for executing the priorities included in the strategy. Senator Baldwin has long been leading efforts in the Senate to address water contamination from chemicals containing PFAS and ensure Wisconsinites have clean drinking water. Last summer, Senator Baldwin supported the bipartisan&nbsp;National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020&nbsp;that includes a requirement that the military phase out the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS, prohibits the uncontrolled release of PFAS at military installations, and provides new tools for states to initiate environmental cleanup of PFAS at military facilities, including sites in Wisconsin like Truax Field.  Last fall, Senator Baldwin called on the Trump administration to respond more urgently to water contamination caused by PFAS in order to protect human health. In a letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield, Senator Baldwin demanded more EPA research to make PFAS testing more accessible and affordable and more research at CDC on how PFAS exposure harms human health, along with emphasizing the critical need for collaboration between the agencies to address this issue.  Senator Baldwin also helped introduce the bipartisan PFAS Accountability Act last year, which sets clear deadlines and reporting requirements for cleaning up PFAS contamination at federal facilities across the country, including active and decommissioned military bases, and mandates greater transparency. &nbsp;It calls on federal facilities, including military and National Guard installations, to expedite cooperative agreements with states to address PFAS contamination. These agreements commit the federal government to take specific actions and enable states and local communities to be reimbursed for costs incurred to address PFAS contamination. In addition to helping introduce the bipartisan&nbsp;PFAS Accountability Act, Senator Baldwin has&nbsp;pressed the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense&nbsp;for answers after media reports that the agencies were trying to weaken PFAS groundwater cleanup guidelines. She also helped introduce the bipartisan&nbsp;PFAS Detection Act, which provides the U.S. Geological Survey with $45 million to develop new advanced technologies to detect PFAS and then to conduct nationwide sampling for PFAS in the environment.

During the first half of February, I attended President Donald Trump's inspiring State of the Union address, traveled with President Trump for the Opportunity Now Summit, and met with school leaders on education issues. I also had the opportunity to personally award the winner of the Congressional App Challenge. Below you can also find information on this year's Congressional Art Competition.  State of the Union Address In President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, he reaffirmed his commitment to keeping his promises.&nbsp; South Carolina has seen his kept promises first-hand. At 2.3 percent, South Carolina&#8217;s unemployment rate is at a record low. Since President Trump&#8217;s election, 122,000 jobs have been created in South Carolina&#8212;including 19,000 manufacturing jobs, wages increased 4 percent by an average of $5,000 for families in South Carolina. Read my full statement on the President's State of the Union address here.&nbsp;  Opportunity NOW Summit&nbsp; I was grateful to travel with President Trump for the launch of Opportunity NOW, a new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across America.    Opportunity NOW Summit&nbsp;  Meetings with Midlands Technical College and Magnet Schools of America This week I met with the&nbsp;Midlands Technical College&nbsp;Board of Trustees to talk about the importance of technical colleges which teach the skills necessary to succeed in our dynamic workforce.   Meeting with Midlands Technical College  Last week,&nbsp;I was recognized by the Magnet Schools of America (MSA) as a Champion of Magnet School Excellence and to be a steadfast supporter of magnet schools, in South Carolina and nationally.

Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week  Hearing on Women&#8217;s Access to Reproductive Health Care   As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held the first legislative hearing in 20 years to protect women&#8217;s reproductive health and considered the Women&#8217;s Health Protection Act. This bill ensures that every American woman has equal access to comprehensive reproductive health care no matter where they live. Since 2011, states have passed more than 450 medically unnecessary restrictions on reproductive care. Today, 90 percent of counties in our country are without a single abortion provider, and six states have only one clinic. The Women&#8217;s Health Protection Act creates a safeguard against bans and medically unnecessary restrictions. The bill also protects women&#8217;s freedom to make decisions about their own reproductive health care. You can watch video of my opening statement HERE.  Voted YES on the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act  I voted for the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act, a package of six bills that protect public lands and waters in California, Colorado, and Washington. The bill designates approximately 1.3 million acres of wilderness, the strongest level of protection for federal land, and incorporates more than 1,000 river miles into the National Wild and Scenic River Systems (NWSRS). The legislation includes four key initiatives centered on protection for California landscapes and increased access to the outdoors:  The&nbsp;Northwest California Wilderness, Recreation, and Working Forests Act   The&nbsp;Central Coast Heritage Act   The&nbsp;San Gabriel Mountains Foothills and Rivers Protection Act   The Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act  The legislation boosts recreation opportunities in California and preserves hundreds of thousands of acres of California wilderness, among other conservation initiatives to protect forests, habitats, and wild and scenic rivers. You can read detailed descriptions of the legislation here.  Voted YES to Remove the Deadline for the Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment   The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) simply states:  &#8220;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex.&#8221;  The ERA would finally affirm women&#8217;s equality in our Constitution and strictly prohibit sex discrimination. The amendment passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support in 1971 and 1972, but it included a clause requiring ratification by 1979, which was later extended before it expired in 1982. At the time of expiration, 35 of the 38 required state legislatures had voted to ratify the ERA. Nevada ratified the ERA in 2017, Illinois in 2018 and, in January 2020, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it. I voted to pass a resolution to remove the arbitrary 1982 deadline and take a critical step toward ensuring the ERA officially becomes the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Onward!  Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  America&#8217;s Red Rock Wilderness Act  Our national parks and wildernesses are American treasures. Sadly, the Trump Administration continues their campaign to auction off these treasures to oil and gas corporations. The America&#8217;s Red Rock Wilderness Act will protect more than 8 million acres of Utah, including the Great Basin, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Moab-La Sal Canyons, Henry Mountains, Glen Canyon, San Juan-Anasazi, Canyonlands Basin, San Rafael Swell, Book Cliffs, and Uinta Basin. By designating these areas as wildernesses, wildlife will be protected, ancestral lands preserved, and access protected for future generations of hikers and environmental enthusiasts.  Housing Is Infrastructure Act  Rising housing costs continue to force more and more middle- and working-class residents to leave our region in search of affordable housing. This is unacceptable and threatens the composition and identity of our local communities. To address the affordable housing crisis, I cosponsored the Housing is Infrastructure Act which provides $100 billion for effective but underfunded federal programs to increase the supply of affordable housing.  Letters Anna Wrote this Week  Letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Demanding Action on Russian Propaganda  This week I wrote my seventh letter to Federal Communications (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai, urging him to investigate Russian state-sponsored media outlets broadcasting propaganda in the U.S. The U.S. Intelligence Community has concluded that Russian state-sponsored media meddled in our national elections when they pushed anti-U.S. messaging over American broadcast airwaves, and Russian state-sponsored media continues to air on American stations. The FCC is required to identify foreign propaganda on American airwaves, but under Chairman Pai&#8217;s leadership, the Commission has failed to enforce its own rules. The FCC&#8217;s continued inaction is a stunning abdication of its responsibility to protect Americans from malicious interference in our elections from a foreign adversary. As voters decide who we will elect to lead our country, it&#8217;s critical that we are not influenced by foreign propaganda. You can read my letter here.&nbsp;  Weekly Highlights  Lyme Champion Award    It was a wonderful honor to receive the Lyme Champion Award from the Center for Lyme Action for my work to advance research and awareness for Lyme Disease. Through my legislation the Department of Health and Human Services has convened a working group of experts to review existing research and identify gaps in our understanding of tick-borne diseases. This has culminated in a report with recommendations for the federal government to address vector borne disease. Lyme disease is a debilitating condition and it&#8217;s one of the fastest growing infectious diseases in the United States with over 300,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Thank you to Center For Lyme Action co-founder Bonnie Crater of Portola Valley and all the Center&#8217;s advocates for your efforts to combat this terrible disease and for the generous award.&nbsp; In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. Over 10,067 constituents have already contacted me in 2020. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me. This week, 1,353 constituents contacted our office about issues including:   181 constituents wrote to me in opposition of fracking   61 constituents wrote to me in support of eliminating the time limit on the ERA ratification   50 constituents wrote to me in support of the Banning Toxic Pesticides Act  Anna's Recommended Reading and Watching&nbsp;  I frequently read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from.&nbsp;  Washington Post Opinion (2/13/2020) &#8211; &#8220;Health-care workers are the front-line warriors against coronavirus. We must protect them.&#8221;  Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy Director Michael Osterholm and Documentarian Mark Olshaker make the strong case to prioritize health-care workers and first responders when it comes to the distribution of protective health equipment. To minimize the threat of coronavirus, we must ensure our health providers are healthy enough to perform their duties. Friendly Reminder  U.S. Census Job Openings  The U.S. Census Bureau needs to hire more workers in the Bay Area for the 2020 Census. They have temporary supervisory, outreach, and recruiting positions available, the pay is competitive, and the work is critical to obtaining an accurate count for next year&#8217;s census. You can find more information on available positions here.  Sincerely,&nbsp;  Anna G.

Unlike a Congressional budget, the President's budget lays out the Administration&#8217;s priories for the upcoming year with recommended spending levels.&nbsp;I visited the White House on Tuesday and met with the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),&nbsp;Russ Vought. We discussed many of the President&#8217;s funding priorities and how they could strengthen Eastern and Southeastern Ohio. The budget includes funding for rural broadband expansion, opioid treatment, the border wall, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The President has made it clear&nbsp;with this budget proposal&nbsp;that he is continuing to prioritize rural America.  Now having the Administration&#8217;s input, it is up to Congress to pass a budget that actually becomes law. This is the second year in a row that House Democrats have no intentions of releasing a budget. In order to address our deficit and out-of-control government spending, I&#8217;m hopeful they&#8217;ll decide to show some fiscal responsibility by - at a very minimum - passing a budget.     Ohio Fraternal Order of Police Visit   This week I met with representatives from the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police, the &#8220;protector of the protectors.&#8221; I gladly thanked them for all they do for the men and women in blue, and we discussed legislation to promote safety and fairness for law enforcement and the communities they serve. I&#8217;ll always stand with our police and other first responders.     Problem Solvers Caucus  Based on the overwhelmingly negative coverage from the mainstream media, one could easily conclude that Congress doesn&#8217;t work together on anything. But I can tell you - that is simply not true. I&#8217;m a member of a bipartisan group of 48 Republicans and Democrats called the Problem Solvers Caucus. We meet regularly and work hard to reach across the aisle to find real solutions to problems facing America - issues like upgrading our infrastructure, expanding broadband access to rural America, and making prescription drugs more affordable, just to name a few. Just last week, the House approved &#8220;Problem Solvers&#8221; legislation, that I cosponsored, to strengthen the U.S. Postal Service by eliminating outdated rules that currently make it financially difficult for the USPS to fulfill its mission effectively. This week,&nbsp;I joined my Problem Solvers Caucus colleagues at a press conference to talk about what we have accomplished and what our caucus is looking to work on moving forward. This bipartisan group agrees that we were sent to Congress to govern, and to work TOGETHER to serve the American people.     Union Local High School Visit   One of my most favorite parts of serving you in Congress is being able to talk with young people - the next generation of America&#8217;s leaders - and listening to what they&#8217;re most concerned about and interested in. I had a great conversation with students from Union Local in Belmont County earlier this week that touched on a range of issues, including the opioid epidemic, rural broadband, and even the Congressional baseball game for charity, which I play in every year. It was a great discussion and I&#8217;m glad they stopped by.    Thank you again for subscribing to my weekly District Download.

It is important to remember that Congress holds the power of the purse. The President's budget is merely a reflection of his priorities and a suggestion to the House and Senate. His proposal demonstrates his commitment to decreasing our national debt and balancing our federal budget, and we can use his proposal to guide our discussions in Congress. I am proud to serve on the powerful Appropriations Committee, which sets the funding levels for discretionary spending, and we have a lot of work to do. We have already started hosting Appropriations Subcommittee hearings to discuss funding for different departments and offices of the federal government. One place where I believe the President's budget proposal fell short was at Hanford. Since I came to Congress, every Administration has proposed cuts to the Hanford cleanup, and I have worked across the aisle to restore funding. Federal dollars are critical to ensuring the men and women of the Hanford workforce are able to safely and efficiently clean up the millions of gallons of nuclear waste at the Hanford Site, keep our groundwater and the Columbia River safe from contamination, and fulfill the federal government's promise to the Tri-Cities community.&nbsp;    The Columbian: \"In Our View: Nuclear waste requires innovative solutions\"  President Trump's proposal also did not include funding for the licensing of Yucca Mountain, which is a change from his previous position. It is the law of the land: Yucca Mountain is the nation's sole permanent repository for nuclear waste. With 56 gallons of nuclear waste at the Hanford Site alone, no district in the United States is more dependent on Yucca Mountain than Washington's 4th. I have met personally with the President to urge him to reconsider his change in position.&nbsp; As we continue through the Appropriations process, I will work to represent Central Washington's priorities and ensure the federal government fulfills its moral and legal obligation to clean up the Hanford Site.&nbsp;  Healthy Forests Prevent Wildfires   In Central Washington, we understand how important active land management is for wildfire prevention. I am proud to support commonsense land management practices and policies that both protect our national forests and communities from wildfires but also protect the environment. My friend, Rep. Westerman, recently introduced the Trillion Trees Act that would plant 1 trillion trees by 2050 and incentivize the use of wood products as carbon sequestration devices. This week, I visited with U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen and attended a Summit on Active Forest Management and Wildfire Suppression, hosted by the Western Caucus, to discuss Rep. Westerman's proposal and several ways we can promote healthy forests and sustain our public lands. Native Communities Have Had Enough   Patricia Whitefoot has been an incredible advocate for Native women and a critical ally for me as we work in Congress to address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. She joined me in the nation's Capitol to discuss our legislative efforts like Savanna's Act that - for too long - have been stalled in the Judiciary Committee. I have met with tribal leaders across the Pacific Northwest to hear how this crisis is affecting our communities. One thing is clear: Native communities have had enough. We cannot continue to drag our feet while the loved ones of these women wait for answers.&nbsp; Calling All High School Artists: Congressional Art Competition   The 2020 Central Washington Congressional Art Competition is now OPEN!

Twelve years ago, five students lost their lives at a mass shooting at Northern Illinois University. Two years ago, 14 students and 3 staff members were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. One year ago, five people lost their lives and many more were injured when a gunman entered an Aurora, Illinois warehouse. Enough is enough. At last year&#8217;s vigil in Aurora, I vowed to take legislative action to combat this epidemic of gun violence. But in states like Illinois, these efforts are often undermined by traffickers coming from Indiana and other states with looser laws. In Chicago, 60% of the guns recovered from crime scenes are trafficked in from out of state. Earlier this week, to stem this onslaught, I introduced the Gun Trafficker Detection Act with Rep.Ted Deutch (FL-22) and Robin Kelly (IL-02).  The bill would create a federal requirement that gun owners must report their gun if lost or stolen within 48 hours. This helps law enforcement identify and prosecute traffickers, who often claim their gun was lost or stolen when it turns up at a crime scene across state lines. The bill also makes traffickers liable for any damage done by their guns and makes repeat violators ineligible to buy firearms for five years. Yesterday, I spoke on the floor in favor of my bill.    To watch my floor speech, click the image above or click here.   The people of Illinois have been loud and clear: We want to keep our friends and family safe from the scourge of gun violence.&nbsp;The Gun Trafficker Detection Act will help law enforcement address the spread of guns from states with lax gun laws.  I promise to never stop fighting for gun violence prevention measures that make our communities and schools safer. As your Representative, I work for you and want to hear your priorities and concerns. To keep up with the work I&#8217;m doing in Congress, follow my social media or subscribe to my newsletter.

This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year. This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model. It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference. In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area. I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our country&#8217;s food and agriculture interests. Read more here,&nbsp;  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products. The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.&nbsp;I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient. This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.&nbsp;For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products. Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store. Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as &#8220;milk&#8221;. I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law. Read more here.&nbsp;  Dropping the Puck in Glens Falls to Stick It to Cancer and Helping Kids Learn to Skate   This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the community \"Try Hockey for Free\" event in Glens Falls, where I helped introduce many young constituents&nbsp;to the sport of hockey. This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game. NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!  Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce.&nbsp;   It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing. In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease. I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases. I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.   I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards. I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress. Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events. The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees. This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires. Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance. This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base. Read more here.  Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving on&#8239;our embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts. This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted. As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical. Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders. Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots. We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and I&#8217;m honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress. Read more here.  Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown. The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities.&nbsp; Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns. Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities. I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.

The op-ed was published in&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;this week. Read it here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!

Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for \"absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies\" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases. Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines &#8211; though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks.  \"New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,\" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

It was a very eventful week and I'm excited to tell you about what we accomplished. Here are some highlights:   I was the Grand Marshall for the Ninth Annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade I toured the Indian River Lagoon to see living shorelines and learn more about preserving our environment I attended the signing of the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act by President Trump at the White House I spoke on the House floor in recognition of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and her contributions to our community and country  CELEBRATING OUR RACING HISTORY: This weekend I had the honor of serving as the Grand Marshall of this year&#8217;s Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade! Since the 1920s, Daytona Beach has been the home of&nbsp;NASCAR, with drivers setting records racing down our beach to the famous North Turn and A1A. This race is an important part of our community&#8217;s history and it&#8217;s always one of my favorite events every year!    Serving as Grand Marshall at the 9th annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade  CONSERVING OUR SHORELINE:&nbsp;Our beautiful and natural shorelines can co-exist with development when done correctly. Living shorelines and mangroves are important for our communities because they are the best natural barriers against storm surges. Estuaries and mangroves are also important to commercial fisherman. Around 80 percent of them rely on estuaries and mangroves for spawning.&nbsp;I enjoyed touring our local living shorelines to learn more about how conservancies bring free market, volunteering and community based solutions to our community. It's important we maintain our living shorelines to help keep Florida resilient.&nbsp;    Views of our Indian River Lagoon living shoreline  SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS: This week, I went to the White House to see President Trump sign another bill supporting our veterans into law &#8212; and this time, it was a bill I co-sponsored! The&nbsp;Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act&nbsp;supports our veterans, helping them find opportunities for jobs in STEM fields when they return to civilian life. I was glad&nbsp;to work on this bill with two fellow Florida congressmen, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Neal Dunn, and I was proud to be there as the President signed it into law!    President Trump signing the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act into law RECOGNIZING SERVANT LEADERSHIP: I can't think of anyone better to highlight great servant leadership in our community and our country this Black History Month than our district's very own Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. Bethune founded and was President of the all African-American girls school in Daytona Beach, which later became&nbsp;Bethune&#8211;Cookman University.

The Senator also joined his colleagues in Utah's Congressional delegation in commemorating Utah's role in the women's suffrage movement and met with several groups of Utahns visiting Washington.           150 years ago today, Seraph Young became the first woman to vote in Utah. It would be another 50 years until the 19th Amendment extended voting rights to women throughout the country. Utah women led the way. Senator Romney joined his Utah delegation colleagues Senator Lee and Congressmen Bishop, Stewart, Curtis, and McAdams to honor Utah's role in the women's suffrage movement. You can watch their tribute below:   Senator Romney spoke on the Senate floor to commemorate the leading role of Utahns in the fight for women&#8217;s suffrage. After he concluded his remarks, the Senate unanimously passed the resolution he introduced with Senator Lee recognizing Utah&#8217;s leading role in the suffrage movement and celebrating the sesquicentennial of the first votes by women under an equal suffrage law on February 14, 1870.   As the fourth most visited national park in the country, Zion is a pillar of the local tourism economy, helping support jobs and generate revenue. Senator Romney led the Utah delegation in sending a letter to Interior Secretary Bernhardt opposing a reservation system which the National Park Service has proposed for Zion National Park that would restrict visitor access and have negative impacts on the local economy.   Full story by Kathy Stephenson here.   This week, Senator Romney opened a new office&nbsp;in St. George to better serve residents of Southern Utah, reaffirming his commitment to ensuring Utahns continue to receive the assistance they need on issues related to Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, and other federal matters. Office information, as well as information on how to schedule an appointment, can be found on our website.   Senator Romney met with Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez to update him on the status of the Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement Act, legislation he introduced with Arizona Senators McSally and Sinema. This week, its companion House legislation, led by Congressmen Bishop and Curtis, advanced out of the House Natural Resources Committee. The Senator applauded the committee's advancement of the legislation and urged for its immediate consideration in the Senate, saying: \"There is no reason to wait any longer to resolve this longstanding issue.\"     January's vaping rules fall short of protecting our nation's youth and the public health. Senator Romney led a group of colleagues in sending a letter to the director of the Center for Tobacco Products expressing their concerns and requesting answers about devices, flavor requirements, and the Premarket Tobacco Product Applications process as the FDA implements the guidance saying: \"Despite mounting evidence that flavors are a key driver of youth [e-cigarette] use, the January Guidance has glaring policy gaps that keep kids addicted to flavored products.\" The letter can be found here.   At a time when Libya's civil war poses a threat to U.S. interests, clarifying the U.S.-Libya strategy, including defining who our friends are, will help protect our regional interests. During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing examining the Administration's Libya strategy, Senator Romney urged&nbsp;the Administration to unequivocally communicate its posture toward Libya on the global stage.     Senator Romney met with several groups of Utahns this week, including:   Representatives from the Utah Medical Association.   Representatives from Southern Utah University.   Davis County Commissioner Bob Stevenson.   Olha, a Ukranian student living in Utah through the State Department's Future Leaders Exchange program.

A Milestone for Equality This week, the House took action to move our nation closer to our founding ideal that all are created equal by passing H.J. Res 79. This resolution would remove the arbitrary deadline for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  One hundred years after women won the right to vote, it is a shameful reality that the Equal Rights Amendment still has not been enshrined in the Constitution. &nbsp;As a result, millions of American women still face inequality under the law and injustice in their careers and lives, including a devastating wage gap, pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Currently, without the ERA, the Constitution does not guarantee equality between men and women.         By passing this resolution, the House is paving the way to enshrining Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution, which will achieve justice for women and progress for families by increasing paychecks so moms can pay for their family's needs such as rent, groceries, childcare and health care. &nbsp;The Equal Rights Amendment will strengthen America, unleashing the full power of women in our economy and upholding the value of equality in our democracy. &nbsp;Because when Women succeed, America succeeds!  &nbsp;    Congresswoman Pelosi&nbsp;joins House Democrats for a press conference&nbsp;ahead of the vote to remove the ratification deadline for the Equal Rights Amendment.  &nbsp;   An Insult to Americans President Trump&#8217;s latest budget continues his relentless attacks on the health and economic security of hard-working Americans. &nbsp;It is a complete reversal of the promises he made in the campaign and a contradiction of the statements he made at the State of the Union. The President has broken his promises to seniors and families by slashing half a trillion dollars from Medicare, taking $900 billion from the lifeline of Medicaid, and cutting Social Security Disability Insurance. Two-thirds of long-term care is payed for by Medicaid.&nbsp; It is a middle class benefit.&nbsp; These cuts endanger the health of seniors in long-term care needs for them and their families.&nbsp; They also hurt rural hospitals, people seeking opioid addiction treatment, veterans and their families. &nbsp;At the same time, the President is in court fighting to overturn the Affordable Care Act which has the pre-existing condition benefit and is important to families. Our federal budget should be a statement of our national values.&nbsp; Once again, the President is showing just how little he values the good health, financial security and well-being of hard-working American families. &nbsp;The President's budget is anti-growth, does not create good-paying jobs and increases the national debt.  &nbsp;     Protecting Americans This week, with the strong War Powers Resolution to limit the President&#8217;s military action in Iran, the Senate joined the House to honor the first responsibility we have as Members of Congress: to keep the American people safe.&nbsp; The President&#8217;s reckless decision to engage in hostilities against Iran without consulting Congress continues to endanger our servicemembers, diplomats and others. &nbsp;Yet, for weeks now, the Administration has kept the Congress and American people in the dark about its actions and lack of strategy, including the resulting threats to our troops. &nbsp;More than 100 American servicemembers have been diagnosed with Traumatic Brain Injury from Iran&#8217;s retaliatory strike. The House has maintained a drumbeat of action to limit the President&#8217;s dangerous military action and to save American lives by passing our War Powers Resolution, in addition to&nbsp;legislation to repeal the 2002 Iraq Authorization for Use of Military Force and legislation&nbsp;to prohibit funding for military action against Iran not authorized by Congress. &nbsp;Now, we will prepare to take up Senator Kaine&#8217;s War Powers Resolution in the coming weeks. The President needs to listen to the will of Congress and the American people and work with Congress on a de-escalatory strategy that will protect American lives and interests. &nbsp;America and the world cannot afford war.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;      A constituent contacted my office recently because his wife and child&#8217;s immigrant visas were affected by the Presidential Proclamation 9645. The office followed up with the US Embassy to provide more information regarding the situation of the constituent and his family.&nbsp; As a result, the constituent and his family were recommended for a visa wavier and their applications were recently approved.

Now that this sham impeachment is finally behind us, I&#8217;m hopeful Democrats will finally move on and return to legislating. On Monday, I joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network to discuss the need for Congress to get back to work for the American people.   Click  or on the image above to watch   Great News for Gilmer County Last spring, I wrote a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue in support of the Elijay Telephone Company&#8217;s application requesting grant funds to provide fiber broadband service to several unserved areas in Gilmer County. I&#8217;m proud to share with you that USDA recently granted our request, awarding Elijay Telephone Company with a $4.4 million grant to deploy high-speed broadband infrastructure throughout Gilmer County. This strong investment will support the construction of 90 miles of fiber-optic infrastructure in a service area that includes 2,159 households and 22 poultry farms. Throughout my time in Congress, I&#8217;ve worked not only to expand Georgians&#8217; access to rural broadband, but to provide Georgians with more choices when it comes to service providers. Small internet service providers &#8211; like Ellijay Telephone Company &#8211; can help make that happen, which is why this grant funding falls right in line with the mission voiced by the Trump Administration to better connect rural America.   Protecting the Lives of the Unborn This week, House Democrats brought H.J. Res. 79 &#8211; legislation that would remove the already expired deadline to ratify the so-called &#8220;Equal Rights Amendment&#8221; &#8211; to the House floor. Contrary to Democrats&#8217; claims, H. J. Res. 79 isn&#8217;t about protecting women &#8211; it&#8217;s about eliminating any law regulating abortion. If Democrats got their way and this bill was signed into law, the unlimited right to take an unborn child&#8217;s life would forever be enshrined in the Constitution.  I believe we, as a society, share a universal duty to protect the most defenseless humans among us &#8212; those living in the womb. One person&#8217;s reproductive right cannot outweigh another person&#8217;s right to live. For my family, protecting life is deeply personal. Click here or on the image below to hear our story.

As Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru heads to the Supreme Court, I led my colleagues in signing an amicus brief in support of Our Lady of Guadalupe School&#8217;s religious liberty. The teaching of religious principles and customs is at the very core of faith for many, if not most, religions. Yet in the opinion under review, the court barely addressed the importance of this aspect of religion. To read more about this case and our efforts to protect religious liberty, click here.   This week, I joined Laura Ingraham on Fox News to discuss the Democrats&#8217; latest attack on President Trump. Click here or on the image above to watch.   Modernizing our Criminal Justice System Under current prison regulations, inmates who use the email system at Bureau of Prison facilities must consent to government review of their attorney-client communications, the contents of which can be accessed by prosecutors. However, other forms of communication, including telephone calls, currently receive protections under attorney-client privilege. This week, the House Judiciary Committee passed my bill, the Effective Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act, to modernize our criminal justice system by extending attorney-client privilege to electronic communications, allowing incarcerated individuals to communicate with their attorneys efficiently and privately. Attorney-client privilege is a pivotal part of our legal system because it helps ensure fairness to all individuals, and I&#8217;m glad to have partnered with my colleagues to introduce this bill.   It&#8217;s always a good day when Northeast Georgians visit my D.C. office, especially Sheriff Stacy Nicholson of Gilmer County. As the son of a Georgia State Trooper, I have seen firsthand the sacrifices our officers make to keep us safe.

I will be hosting two important community conversations next week to hear more from you all about the issues impacting our community, and share some exciting policy initiatives I&#8217;ve been working on. On Tuesday, February 18th, I will be hosting a discussion of my vision for a progressive foreign policy&#8212; one that centers on human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America&#8217;s engagement in the world, and makes military action a last resort. And on Thursday, I&#8217;ll be hosting a community conversation on the dangerous spread of hate crimes in the United States and how to combat it. We will have a discussion with leaders of different communities on how we can together to battle this common enemy here in Minnesota and nationwide. I look forward to seeing many of you back in the District next week!  In service,    Ilhan Omar Member of Congress    UPCOMING EVENTS Join us for a Community Conversation about my vision for a progressive foreign policy on Tuesday, February 18, 2020, 12:00 - 1:30 PM CST. RSVP on Eventbrite using this link. I will also host a Community Conversation on combating hate on Thursday, February 20, 6:00-8:00 PM CST. RSVP on Eventbrite using this link. For all updates and upcoming events visit our website here. All events are free and open to the public.    Pathway to Peace This week, I introduced a package of seven bills that outline a bold progressive vision to reimagines the country&#8217;s approach to foreign policy as one that centers human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America&#8217;s engagement in the world, and makes military action a last resort. I have firsthand experience with how destructive war can be&#8212;and I see how our continuous involvement in foreign conflicts is not making our country or our world any safer. I believe that when the United States says it champions human rights, democracy, and peace, we should mean it.   Eritrean Asylum ENSURE Act This administration will stop at nothing to make life painful for people of color seeking a better future. Not only has the President added Eritrea to its latest Muslim Ban, but he is also now threatening to deport Eritreans who have settled here. That&#8217;s why I introduced the ENSURE Act to stop the United States from deporting Eritreans fleeing state oppression. The bill places a two-year stay on removals; prohibits the detention of Eritrean nationals during removal procedures; and, requires up-to-date reporting on Eritreans facing imminent removal.   The PRO Act&nbsp; As a former union member myself, I can attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right to organize. That&#8217;s why we need the PRO Act, which puts power back in the hands of workers where it belongs. It will address the challenges and attacks that labor unions have been facing for decades that have led to the erosion of wages, a spike in workplace discrimination, and dangerous growth in inequality. Unions don&#8217;t only raise wages. They create working class solidarity between workers across gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.    Trump Budget This week, the Budget Committee held a hearing on President Trump&#8217;s latest spending proposals. The administration's new budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stamps&#8212;while continuing the President&#8217;s disastrous tax breaks for the rich and while increasing wasteful spending on endless wars. We need a budget for the people that invests in housing, education, healthcare, and addressing the climate crisis, not a budget that benefits billionaires like the President. The American people deserve better.       &nbsp;  Stay Updated with the Office of Representative Ilhan Omar   Please do not respond to this e-mail.&nbsp;Contact the Office  &nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSCRIBE SERVICES  Unsubscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp; Privacy            ","district":"5","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"MN","party":"Democrat","score":2.179327},{"name":"Congressman Joe Courtney","address":"ct02ima@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-14","subject":"A Busy Week, & The Start of a Months-Long Budget Process","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }         News from Representative Courtney  &nbsp; &nbsp;                                         &nbsp;  Dear Cormack,  Following a busy week in Washington, here with a few updates on several priorities for eastern Connecticut.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Honoring Those Lost on 10th&nbsp;Anniversary of Kleen Energy Explosion  Last Friday marked ten years since the tragic explosion at the Kleen Energy Systems power plant in Middletown. The blast injured dozens of workers, and it took the lives of six: Peter&nbsp;Chepulis, Raymond&nbsp;Dobratz, Kenneth Haskell, Roy&nbsp;Rushton, Chris Walters, and one of my close friends, Ron Crabb. On Sunday, I was in Middletown along with colleagues, community leaders, and friends and family of those who were lost in the tragic accident, to honor and remember those who never came home that day. Ten years ago, workplace safety laws failed these six individuals, and the dozens of others who were injured in the blast. Nothing can ever make up for the lives lost that day, but we have a responsibility as a community and as a Congress to ensure we do all we can to protect America&#8217;s workers. Last year, on the 9th&nbsp;anniversary of the explosion, I introduced the Protecting America&#8217;s Workers Act (PAWA) to strengthen and modernize the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) &#8211; which hasn&#8217;t been meaningfully updated by Congress in over 50 years. The bill is simple, and contains some common-sense measures like improving whistleblower protections; requiring the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to investigate all cases of death and series injuries that occur within a place of employment; and establishing rights for families of workers who were killed on the job by giving them the right to meet with OSHA investigators, receive copies of citations, and more. The lives lost ten years ago deserve to be honored with action. To read how PAWA makes workplaces safer, click here to visit my website.        Rep. Courtney joined community leaders, friends, and families at a memorial service for those lost in the Kleen Energy explosion     Bipartisan Action on Surprise Health Care Billing  Surprise medical bills are a crisis waiting to happen for so many families in eastern Connecticut and across the country. When people are ill, the last thing they should have to worry about is how to safeguard themselves against complex billing technicalities that result in surprise, sky-high medical bills. The cost of health care is a top-line issue for folks in our region, and surprise billing is a major contributor &#8211; my office has received far too many calls from people in eastern Connecticut who have not been treated fairly.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve already taken steps in the House to curb the cost of prescription medication, and this week we took on surprise billing. On Tuesday, my colleagues and I on the house Education &amp; Labor Committee voted to approve the bipartisan Ban Surprise Billing Act (H.R. 5800), a bill that would protect patients from devastating surprise medical bills, and would finally give them the financial confidence and peace of mind they deserve. These protections would be for everyone &#8211; for people who receive health care through their employer, and for those who are enrolled in the individual market. Erica Moser did a great job covering the ins and outs of the bill in her article for The Day, click here to read more. One of the most exciting parts about H.R. 5800 is that it&#8217;s so bipartisan &#8211; it was supported by both the Democratic Chairman of the Committee, and by the Republican Ranking Member. People in Congressional Districts across America are impacted by surprise medical bills, and it&#8217;s great to see Members from both sides of the aisle coming together to address the problem. I commend Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for working together to advance this bipartisan bill, I was proud to support it, and I&#8217;m looking forward to voting to pass it when it comes before the House for a final vote.        Click here to watch Rep. Courtney's remarks in favor of H.R. 5800     Meeting with National Defense University Students  On Tuesday, I hosted a large group of students from the National Defense University&#8217;s Eisenhower School to discuss some of the top priorities on the horizon for our Armed Forces and the industrial base, and to learn more about their work as students focusing on undersea warfare. As always, these NDU students were totally impressive &#8211; they came to study in Washington from all across the U.S., represented a variety of branches, backgrounds, agencies, and experiences, and were sharp and well informed on our national security strategy and priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our conversation turned in large part to the flurry of activity we&#8217;ve seen in Connecticut&#8217;s defense manufacturing sector recently. Up and down the supply chain, skilled manufacturers and small companies&nbsp;are seeing new opportunities for work. Connecticut&#8217;s defense manufacturing is booming, but even that good news presents its own challenges &#8211; mainly, how can we make sure that we have a workforce that&#8217;s skilled and well educated enough to take advantage of these new opportunities? The answer to that question has been the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board&#8217;s revolutionary job skills training program, the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative (MPI). The MPI was kick-started with a $6 million federal grant that I helped to procure back in 2015, and since then it&#8217;s flourished alongside our state&#8217;s burgeoning manufacturing sector. The MPI has helped Electric Boat (EB) to grow by thousands of employees in just a few short years. In the last year alone, EB reported that they made over 1,000 hires directly from the pipeline. The MPI is exactly what was needed to fill the ranks of a booming manufacturing sector, and its been a total success for our region. It was great to host this impressive class of National Defense University students in Washington this week, and to discuss with them all of the moving parts that must work in unison to deliver the tools are Navy and Armed Forces need.        Students from the National Defense University met with Rep. Courtney at his Washington, DC office &nbsp;     The Start of a Months-Long Budget Process&nbsp;  Earlier this week, the White House released their official 2021 budget request. Ultimately it is Congress&#8217;s job to craft and pass a budget through the House and the Senate, and it&#8217;s the President's job to sign it. However, the start of the budget negotiation process typically begins with the White House&#8217;s budget request &#8211; their &#8220;proposed budget&#8221; &#8211; and this year we&#8217;re off to a strange start.&nbsp; The White House&#8217;s proposed budget makes $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other health care programs over the next 10 years. It also slashes investments that help workers find and keep good paying jobs, and altogether eliminates bedrock programs that help fund America&#8217;s public education system. Thankfully, this is just the start of a months-long budget negotiation process. The proposed budget introduced by the White House yesterday has already received criticism from both sides of the aisle, and it&#8217;s not going to make it through Congress as-is. It&#8217;s not encouraging to see the White House kick the process off with a budget proposal that points so many important programs in the wrong direction, but as the House moves into our own budget negotiating process, we have an opportunity to work together across the aisle to get it right. It will remain our top priority in the House to protect and defend the health, financial security, and well-being of millions of Americans as we begin debate on the 2021&nbsp;budget.  &nbsp;   Proposed Shipbuilding Budget Receives Bipartisan Criticism&nbsp; One of the components of the 2021 budget request that has generated significant bipartisan concern is the plan to cut back on shipbuilding investment for our Navy. Congress had traditionally worked together to provide strong support for the Navy&#8217;s plans to build, modernize and support a strong fleet of ships, submarines, destroyers and other vessels critical to our national defense. Contrary to expectations, however, the budget we received this week took a significant step backwards &#8211; proposing to purchase just 7 ships, a sharp reduction from the 10 that the Trump&nbsp;Administration itself&nbsp;planned for this year and a nearly 20% reduction in the budget for shipbuilding. Incredibly, one of the cuts included the reduction of a Virginia-class submarine, with only one requested in 2021. This plan flies in the face of more than a decade of testimony from our defense leaders about the unmatched value of our submarine force and increasing alarm about shortfalls in the fleet. It&#8217;s even in direct contradiction with the Trump Administration's own plans for our Navy and defense strategy. Given that every submarine we build will be in service for four decades, the decision to plan for only one new submarine next year is short-sighted. As Chairman of the House&nbsp;Seapower&nbsp;and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I can say with certainly that this budget is dead on arrival. Throughout the week, bipartisan concern about this proposal has grown across Congress and I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to dig into this surprising plan as we begin our work on the 2021 budget.

In 1972, Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment, which proposed banning discrimination based on sex with the simple phrase, \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on the account of sex.\" Since that passage, we've been waiting for 38 states to ratify the amendment. In January, Virginia became that 38th state.  Today, the House of Representatives passed H.J.Res. 79 paving the way for passage of this historic amendment and reaffirming Congress&#8217; support for women&#8217;s equality. Thirty-eight states, including New Mexico, have agreed to put an end to discrimination by amending the Constitution and we should celebrate this momentous occasion and accept our 28th Amendment.  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice, under Attorney General William Barr, is arguing against the Equal Rights Amendment's ratification. Congress, not the Executive Branch, has authority over the amendment process, but now the Trump Administration is dragging the ratifying states into a prolonged battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. The passage of H.J.Res. 79 makes it clear where the House stands: the Equal Rights Amendment has been ratified and we will not tolerate discrimination based on sex.  I am proud to be from one of the first states in the country to add an Equal Rights Amendment to its state constitution. I cannot wait to say to every woman that I meet that they have the same protections in their state that New Mexico women have in ours. As the Vice Chair of the Democratic Women's caucus, I will continue to fight for policies that protect women's health, ensure equal pay, and empower women, because when women succeed, our communities are stronger, safer, and more prosperous.

The most basic and sacred of workplace rights that underpinned all of these victories is collective bargaining.&nbsp;Yet, there are continued attempts to rob workers of this crucial tool, causing continuous union membership decline. In 2018, Connecticut saw a 3.5% decline in union membership from the previous year.  &nbsp;  As a WTA, CEA, NEA and SEIU 1199 member, I enjoyed the benefits of collective bargaining and negotiation. With each assault on organized labor, opportunity for workplace improvement is being taken away from workers. In defense of workers, I voted to pass the most significant strengthening of labor law in 80 years: the&nbsp;Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. The PRO Act will bolster the power of workers by giving labor law teeth to prevent intimidation and retaliation. It will strengthen Connecticut workers&#8217; rights to organize and collectively bargain, and put a stop to blatant attacks from employers and state legislatures.  &nbsp;  When it came to the House floor, I introduced an amendment to preserve the ability for new, voluntarily recognized unions to collectively bargain for a reasonable period of time, and oppose the Administration&#8217;s attempts to require employers to post notices inviting rushed decertification campaigns.&nbsp;My amendment was agreed to and passed out of the House as part of the PRO Act. &nbsp;    Rep. Hayes speaks on the floor in support of her amendment to the PRO Act   Now, more than ever, we should not be proposing new rules meant to antagonize and intimidate newly formed unions or new workers advocating for their constitutional rights to organize. We should be giving new unions the tools they need to succeed.&nbsp;The PRO Act is a crucial step in ensuring that the unions that built the workforce of today have a seat at the table as we build the workforce of tomorrow. &nbsp; &nbsp;  I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advocate for the rights of Connecticut workers.

This harmful plan allows states to receive a waiver to block grant their Medicaid programs for certain low-income Medicaid recipients, and would have the impact of weakening the entire program and pushing Medicaid recipients off their much-needed, life-saving health care coverage. These block grants are just the latest in a slew of attempts by this Administration to gut the Affordable Care Act&#8212;and the numerous coverage expansions that it has offered to millions of Americans, of all ages and backgrounds, who were unable to gain affordable coverage before&#8212;and the millions more who could gain coverage in my home state of Texas expands Medicaid. I am proud that my resolution demonstrated our Democratic majority&#8217;s strong opposition to removing the expanded protections that the Affordable Care Act provided to primarily childless adults and those parents who are living at or below the poverty line.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;            Watch my video condemning this Administration&#8217;s latest assault on affordable and accessible health care. &nbsp;    Millions of hard-working Americans have finally been able to gain affordable health insurance&#8212;now the Trump administration wants to take away the progress made by these Americans&#8212;and undercut access to health care. And they also want to chip away at access to health care for millions of Americans who have and will be able to gain coverage through state Medicaid expansions.  That is why I&nbsp;am proud to lead this resolution, and I am proud to fight for affordable and accessible health care each and every day.  Sincerely,    Marc Veasey  P.s.

HOYER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Last week I was proud to bring to the House Floor a resolution disapproving of President Trump's proposal to cut Medicaid services. Medicaid provides affordable, quality health care to&nbsp;low-income Americans, seniors, rural communities, those with disabilities, low-income pregnant women, and Americans seeking treatment for opioid addiction. Instead of expanding access to health care for the most vulnerable in our communities, President Trump and his Administration are actively working to cut funding and limit access to the services that Medicaid provides.&nbsp; Furthermore, despite pledging in last week's State of the Union Address to protect Medicare and Social Security, President Trump's budget proposal released this week seeks to slash Medicaid by $900 billion and cut Medicare by $500 billion. These cuts would have dire consequences for Maryland families, and I'll continue to fight to ensure they never happen.&nbsp; As a leader of the Majority Leader Task Force on Poverty and Opportunity with my colleague Congresswoman Barbara Lee, I will continue to protect and defend Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security from the Trump Administration's sabotage.&nbsp;  As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my&nbsp;office&nbsp;or connecting with me on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, or&nbsp;Instagram.

Ordinarily this would begin the annual process of reconciling the administration's budget with that of Congress. However, House Democrats failed to even propose a budget last year. They refuse to propose a budget and begin the process of negotiating how the federal government should allocate its resources because their socialist agenda would make everything &#8211; from health care, to college, and more &#8211; government-provided, devastating the nation.  Also, the Ways and Means Committee held a mark-up this week on bipartisan legislation to address the issue of surprise medical billing. Continuing reading to learn more about this important piece of legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Addressing Surprise Medical Billing The Ways and Means Committee held a markup on a bipartisan piece of legislation dealing with surprise medical billing. I would like to thank Chairman Neal (D-MA) and Ranking Member Brady (R-TX) for their dedicated work on this thoughtful piece of legislation that protects patients and brings providers, insurers, and hospitals to the table to share in the responsibility of fixing this issue. As a practicing dentist, I can&#8217;t emphasize enough that we need to have a balanced approach to expand provider networks, not shrink them. Our bill makes sure that patients come first, but is also fair to both provides and payers in determining a solution. While no solution is perfect, I believe out framework is the best approach to the issue of surprised medical bills and a step in the right direction.   Telephone Town Hall Thank you to everyone who participated in my telephone&nbsp;town-hall last night. A special thank you to special guest Senator David Perdue for taking the time to join the call. We had a large turnout for the event and I appreciate all of the questions that came in. We answered thirteen questions over the course of the call. The questions ranged from impeachment to rural broadband to concealed carry reciprocity&nbsp;&#8211; and many others. If you didn't get a chance to ask a question, please click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to leave a comment on my website.&nbsp; During our call, I asked participants: \"A majority of House Democrats are co-sponsors of legislation (H.R. 1384) eliminating virtually all public and private health insurance and replacing with a new government plan, and we&#8217;ve heard a lot of talk about &#8220;Medicare for All&#8221; from the Democrat candidates for President. Do you support this policy which is now the prevailing position of Congressional Democrats/Presidential candidates?\" In response to this survey, 88% said they do not support \"Medicare for All\", while 12%&nbsp;of Third District respondents answered that they did. I also asked: \"President Trump recently announced &#8220;Phase One&#8221; of the China trade agreement along with signing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. As he looks to pursue free trade agreements with the U.K., EU, and Kenya, do you support the President&#8217;s trade agenda? \" In response to this survey, 90% of Third District respondents answered they do support the President's trade agenda, while 10% answered that they did not.

It comes as no surprise that the proposed budget is devoid of compassion and empathy, and proposes massive cuts to education programs, housing programs, and critical social safety net programs like Medicare and Medicaid.  Budgets are statements of our values, and I&#8217;m committed to ensuring that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 federal budget affirms equity and justice for all across our district and our country. Now that the FY 2021 Budget proposal has been released, Congress will begin its appropriations work to develop funding bills that reflect the values of the people.  What is the appropriations process?     &nbsp; To determine how federal dollars get spent, Congress conducts an appropriations process every year. The appropriations process determines how much federal funding goes to government agencies and programs - everything from our schools, to our hospitals, to major infrastructure projects.  Too often, though, the appropriations process takes place behind closed doors. Decisions about how to spend valuable resources are made with little to no input from our communities. Those days are over. Last year, hundreds of advocates and constituents engaged with our office on appropriations priorities, ensuring that those closest to the pain are closest to the power - driving and performing policy making.    How can I be involved?     &nbsp;  The appropriations process for FY 2021 is officially underway, and I am seeking your partnership as I work to advocate for the federal resources and programs that serve our communities across the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District.&nbsp;  If you or your organization would like to advocate for a certain federal program, you can submit an appropriations request through this form. The deadline for submissions is Friday, February 28th at 5:00pm EST.  Last year, we were able to secure millions of dollars for federal programs that support community based violence prevention, school based health centers and healthy food options in schools and other critical youth programs.      I&#8217;m grateful for your partnership and I look forward to working together to ensure that our federal budget reflects the values we espouse in the Massachusetts 7th. Together, we can secure robust federal resources critical to addressing the issues of consequence for communities across our district and the across the nation.

So why were 14,000 federal housing vouchers intended to help homeless vets unused last year? If it was due to bureaucratic incompetence then somebody needs to be fired. Read the article below and let me know what you think.&nbsp;  Vern  U.S. Congressman Buchanan Slams Feds for Neglecting Homeless Veterans  WASHINGTON &#8211; Congressman Vern Buchanan today demanded answers from the two federal agencies after thousands of housing vouchers for homeless veterans went unused last year.  &#8220;It is completely unacceptable that our federal government is failing to make housing benefits available to our nation&#8217;s homeless veterans,&#8221; Buchanan said.  &nbsp;&#8220;I am calling on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to immediately rectify this problem and make sure veterans get the benefits they rightfully deserve.&#8221;  Buchanan&#8217;s inquiry comes after shocking testimony at a congressional hearing this month revealed that up to 14,000 housing vouchers went unused. Under the program jointly run by HUD and the VA, a voucher can provide a single homeless veteran with housing for a year or more. If this problem is due to bureaucratic incompetence, then those responsible should be fired immediately. If there are other causes, then it needs to be resolved immediately. Congress appropriated these subsidies to help struggling veterans, not sit unused. These revelations paint the picture of a broken system that is disturbingly reminiscent of the VA&#8217;s failure to spend millions in suicide prevention funds for veterans in 2018. At that time, it was discovered that the VA had spent less than one percent of the $6.2 million in funding made available by Congress for the VA&#8217;s suicide prevention outreach program. Buchanan, who represents more than 88,000 veterans in Southwest Florida, has a strong record of fighting for veterans and military families. In 2019, Buchanan introduced the Veterans Overmedication and Suicide Prevention Act, which requires the VA to study the link between addictive opioids and the alarmingly high rate of suicides among veterans. With veteran suicide rates on the rise in 2018, Buchanan wrote to VA Secretary Wilkie and demanded to know why the VA spent less than one percent of the $6.2 million in funding made available for a veteran suicide prevention program.           &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960. The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.&nbsp;Read the press release and full resolution here.  Background:    The Greensboro Four sit-in protest took place on February 1, 1960. The Greensboro sit-in was a civil rights protest that commenced when four young Black students staged a sit-in at the segregated lunch counter of F.W. Woolworth Department Store in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Greensboro Four: Jabreel Khazan (Ezell Blair Jr.), David Richmond, Franklin McCain and Joseph McNeil were students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, now known as North Carolina A&amp;T State University. Nationwide participation in this new movement included over 700,000 people, including students, clergymen and unified citizens both White and Black. On July 26, 1960, the Woolworth Lunch Counter was finally integrated.    &nbsp;     CBC Leadership Summit&nbsp;        &nbsp;    On February 4, 2020, the Congressional Black Caucus hosted the 2020 National Black Leadership Summit. Over 600 Black leaders from around the country joined the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C. to call national attention to two critical issues facing the Black community: the 2020 Census and Voting Rights.&nbsp; Both have implications for the development of Black communities in the short and long term.&nbsp; The Summit also&nbsp;featured one of North Carolina's own, Rev. Dr. William Barber II, who delivered the keynote address.&nbsp; Recording of the February 4, 2020 Summit can be viewed on the Congressional Black Caucus' Facebook page&nbsp;here.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Fighting for Medicaid Protections     &nbsp;  &nbsp;   On February 6, 2020, Congressman Butterfield spoke on the House floor in opposition to the Trump Administration's illegal Medicaid block grant scheme which would threaten access to healthcare for millions of North Carolinians including vulnerable children and those who are low income, elderly, and disabled. The House of Representatives passed a resolution to disapprove of the Trump administration&#8217;s latest plan to allow states to convert part of their Medicaid programs into block grants.

Butterfield (NC-01) and Congressman Billy Long (MO-07) introduced the&nbsp;Protecting Natural Gas Consumers from Overcharges Act of 2020.&nbsp; The bipartisan bill aims to protect natural gas consumers, residential and industrial, from overpaying for their use of natural gas.&nbsp; The bill amends the National Gas Act to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to set a refund effective date and order a refund when an interstate pipeline is found to be overcharging for its services.&nbsp; FERC currently has these authorities under the Federal Power Act to order refunds from interstate electric utilities when they determine overcharges have been made. On January 28, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960. The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.&nbsp; On January 27, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-1) and Congressmen Mike Conaway (TX-11) introduced H. Res. 810, a resolution to recognize Free File, a public-private partnership allowing low- and moderate-income taxpayers to use tax preparation software and e-filing services at no cost to the government.     Constituent Success Story     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  The district office in Durham received a request for help from a 95-year-old widow of a WWII Veteran for assistance with the Department of Veterans Affairs. For many years, this constituent had not received her benefits and the Durham&nbsp;office staff&nbsp;was determined to find a solution. After extensive research, many emails, calls and conversations, the district staff was able to identify the error and secured a back payment of &nbsp;$14,323 as well as a $979 a month pension for the rest of the constituent's life. The constituent and her family expressed deep gratitude for the help of the Durham staff. It is an honor to serve as advocates for the constituents of North Carolina's First Congressional District.

The impeachment trial is both a symptom of our times and another example of our division. At the beginning of our nation, we did not have an impeachment inquiry of a president for almost 100 years with the partisan impeachment of Andrew Johnson. After more than 100 years, another impeachment inquiry was conducted when the House began a formal impeachment inquiry into President Nixon in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410-4. Within a period of weeks, President Nixon resigned before he was formally impeached. Then, just over two decades later, President Clinton was impeached by the House, on another mostly partisan vote leading to a partisan acquittal in the Senate.&nbsp;  This season of our history and has been referred to as the Age of Investigations and the Age of Impeachment. We have had multiple special counsels since 1974 over multiple topics. This is more than just oversight; it has been a unique time in American history when the politics of the moment have driven rapid calls for investigation and impeachment. Over the past three years, the House of Representatives has voted four times to open an impeachment inquiry: once in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019. Only the second vote in 2019 actually passed and began a formal inquiry.&nbsp;  The Mueller investigation that consumed most of 2018 and 2019 answered many questions about Russian attacks on our voting systems&#8212;though no votes were changed&#8212;but it was also a $32 million investigation that took more than two years of America&#8217;s attention. For the last four months the country has been consumed with impeachment hearings and investigations. The first rumors of issues with Ukraine arose August 28 when Politico published a story about US foreign aid being slow-walked for Ukraine, and then on September 18 when The&nbsp;Washington Post published a story about a whistleblower report that claimed President Trump pressured an unnamed foreign head of state to do an investigation for his campaign.&nbsp;  Within days of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Washington Post story on September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House would begin hearings to impeach the President, which led to the formal House vote to open the impeachment inquiry on October 31 and then a vote to impeach the President on December 18th. But after the partisan vote to impeach the President, Speaker Pelosi held the articles of impeachment for a month before turning them over to the Senate, which began the formal trial of the President of the United States on January 16, 2020. After hearing hours of arguments from both House Managers and the President&#8217;s legal defense team and Senators asking 180 questions to both sides, the trial concluded February 5, 2020. Key Dates to Know&nbsp;   April 21, 2019 - President Zelensky is elected President of Ukraine. May 21 - President Zelensky sworn in. After the ceremony, President Zelensky abolishes Parliament and calls for quick (snap) elections on July 21. July 21 &#8211; Ukrainian Parliamentary elections.

August 26 - The Inspector General for the Intelligence Community declares the whistleblower report &#8220;an urgent matter&#8221; and asks for its release within seven days. The Justice Department looks over the report and notes that though it was written by a person in the intelligence community, it is not related to intelligence matters, so it does not fall within the Inspector General&#8217;s jurisdiction and it is forwarded on to the Department of Justice for review.&nbsp; August 28 - Politico publishes a story that the annual military aid for Ukraine is currently being slow-walked.

December 18 - The House votes to impeach the President with two articles&#8212;Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress January 15 - Speaker Pelosi releases the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate January 16 - Senate trial on impeachment begins. February 5 - Senate trial concludes with acquittal on both articles.  Important Context of What Was Happening in Ukraine  Ukraine became independent in 1991 when it broke away from the Soviet Union, but the Ukrainians have faced constant pressure from Russia ever since. In 2014 Ukraine forced out its pro-Russia president, and Moscow retaliated by taking over Crimea (and stealing the Ukrainian Navy), then rolling tanks into eastern Ukraine and taking all of eastern Ukraine by force. Russian and Ukrainian troops continue to fight every day in eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;  The people of Ukraine face an aggressive Russia on the east and pervasive Soviet era corruption throughout the government and the business community. President Trump met the previous President of Ukraine in 2017 to talk about other countries helping Ukraine with greater military support funds and to ask how Ukraine could address corruption on a wider scale. The two Presidents also spoke about lethal aid (allowing the Ukrainians to buy sniper rifles, anti-tank javelin missiles, and other lethal supplies) to help them fight the invading Russians. The US also started sending a couple hundred American troops to train Ukrainian soldiers in the far west of Ukraine.&nbsp;  Ukrainian&nbsp;President Zelensky  On April 21, 2019, President Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected as the new President of Ukraine. He was a sitcom actor/comedian who had no political experience, but was well known for his television show in which he played the part of a corruption-fighting teacher who was elected as President of Ukraine. His television popularity helped him win the election, but when he was sworn in on May 21, he was relatively unknown to most of the world.&nbsp;  On the same day as his inauguration, May 21, President Zelensky abolished Parliament and called for snap elections to put his party in power. With a new president in place and parliamentary elections in Ukraine coming, starting in June of 2019, the President ordered foreign aid to Ukraine to be held until the end of the fiscal year, but agencies were informed that they should do all the preliminary work needed before the aid was sent, so it would be ready to release at a moment&#8217;s notice. The leadership in Ukraine was not notified that there was a hold on their foreign aid.&nbsp;  The new Parliament was elected on July 21, and President Zelensky&#8217;s party won by a landslide. By mid-August, the new Parliament was working on anti-corruption efforts and trying to establish a High Court on Corruption, which they put in place September 5, 2019. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the early days of the new administration, but by mid August there was clear evidence of actual change in a country that desperately needed a new direction from its corrupt past.&nbsp;  President Trump&#8217;s Phone Call to President Zelensky  On July 25, when President Trump called President Zelensky, the President congratulated President Zelensky for the big win in Parliament and talked about &#8220;burden-sharing&#8221; (other nations also paying their share of support for Ukraine). The two presidents talked about their disapproval of the previous ambassadors to each other&#8217;s countries. But instead of following all the staff preparation notes written by Lt. Col Vindman, the National Security Council staffer assigned to Ukraine, and just talking about &#8220;corruption&#8221; in general, the President brought up a question about Ukraine and the 2016 election interference, which I will note below. President Zelensky also brought up to President Trump that his staff was planning to meet with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, in the coming days, which led to a conversation about Joe Biden and the firing of the previous prosecutor in Ukraine.&nbsp;  After the call, Lt. Col Vindman contacted an attorney at the National Security Council to express his &#8220;policy concerns&#8221; about the call. It is interesting to note that Lt. Col. Vindman&#8217;s boss, Tim Morrison, was also on the call, but he did not see any problems or concerns with the call according to his own testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. Within a month a whistleblower filed a report about the call, saying he heard about the call second-hand and was concerned about the implications of a conversation about elections on a head-of-state call. To keep the July 25th call in context with other news, the day before it took place&#8212;July 24&#8212;Robert Mueller had testified before Congress as the last official act to close down the two-and-a-half-year Mueller investigation and clear the President and his campaign team of any further accusation of election interference.&nbsp;  During the impeachment trial in the Senate, the House Managers repeated over and over that the President was planning to cheat &#8220;again&#8221; on the next election, but the final conclusion of the Mueller Report was &#8220;ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the (Trump) Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.&#8221;&nbsp;  This is especially notable, because for years a rumor circulated that Ukraine was part of the 2016 election interference and that someone in Ukraine was hiding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server that was hacked by the Russians in 2016. As the conspiracy theory goes, it was actually the Ukrainians that hacked the DNC, not the Russians. This is the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory that President Trump asked President Zelensky to help solve during the call.&nbsp;  Agencies of the US Intelligence Community have stated over and over that they did not believe that Ukraine was involved in the Russian election interference from 2016. I personally agree with the Intelligence Community assessment. But Rudy Giuliani, and multiple others around President Trump believed there was a secret plan in 2016 to hurt President Trump&#8217;s election from Ukraine. This accusation was amplified by bits of truth, including that the Ukrainian Ambassador to the US wrote an editorial in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 right before the election, and several other Ukrainian officials publicly spoke out against candidate Trump in 2016.&nbsp;  There is nothing illegal about a foreign nation speaking out for or against a presidential candidate, whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in 2016, or anyone else in the future. It may not be wise to take sides before an election, but it is not illegal. Just because some Ukrainian officials took sides, does not mean that the whole Ukrainian government worked on a cyberattack on our elections. But since this rumor had persisted, and it was a new administration now in Ukraine, President Trump asked President Zelensky to help clear up the facts if he could. That is certainly not illegal or improper, and it is certainly not something that could help the President in the 2020 election, especially since the 2016 Russian election accusation had just been closed the day before.&nbsp; &nbsp; The 2016 &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory is the issue that President Trump asked President Zelensky to &#8220;do us a favor&#8221; about, not the Biden&#8217;s or Burisma. During the July 25 call after the question about &#8220;Crowdstrike,&#8221; President Zelensky mentioned to President Trump that one of his advisers would be meeting with Rudy Giuliani soon. Then, President Trump affirmed that meeting and encouraged them to talk about the Biden investigation and the firing of the Ukrainian Prosecutor.&nbsp;  That may seem out of the blue, but in Washington, DC, that week, the city was buzzing about a Washington Post article that had been written three days before (July 22, 2019) detailing Hunter Biden&#8217;s giant salary ($83,000 per month) for doing essentially nothing for a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company and how it undercut Vice President Biden&#8217;s message on corruption.&nbsp;  It is important to get the context of that week to understand the context of the phone call that day. I have no doubt that the story was just as big of news in Kiev, Ukraine as it was in Washington, DC, that week. President Trump&#8217;s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had been in and out of Ukraine since November 2018, meeting with government officials and trying to find out more about the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory or any other Ukrainian connection to the 2016 election. During that time Rudy Giuliani met several former prosecutors from Ukraine who blamed their departure on Vice President Biden. It is clear that Rudy Giuliani was working to gain information about both of these issues in his capacity as President Trump&#8217;s private attorney.&nbsp;  It is not criminal for Rudy Giuliani to work on opposition research for a presidential campaign or to work on behalf of his client to clear his name from any issues related to the 2016 campaign, which he had done since November 2018. Some have stated that since this was &#8220;foreign information,&#8221; it is illegal. That is absolutely not true. In fact, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee in 2016 paid a British citizen, Christopher Steele, to work his contacts in Russia to create the now debunked &#8220;Steele Dossier&#8221; which the FBI used to open its investigation into President Trump, leading directly to the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller. That &#8220;Dossier&#8221; was opposition research done in Russia by a British citizen, paid for by the Clinton campaign team. Their opposition research was not illegal, but the use and abuse of that document by the FBI to start an investigation was certainly inappropriate and is most likely illegal. But, the FBI warrant issue is still being investigated by the ongoing Durham probe.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, when President Zelensky brought up the issue of Rudy Giuliani and President Trump replied to his statement. You can argue that President Trump should not have discussed the issue with President Zelensky when he brought it up, but it is certainly not illegal or impeachable to talk about it, especially when there are serious questions about Hunter Biden&#8217;s work with Burisma. That is not a conservative conspiracy theory; the issue of Hunter Biden&#8217;s employment in Ukraine was a problem for years at the State Department. It had been raised to Vice President Biden when he was still in office. Every State Department official interviewed for the Trump impeachment investigation noted that at best it was a clear conflict of interest and it was the center of a huge story on corruption in the Washington Post on July 22, 2019. It had the appearance of high-level corruption by using a well-placed family member on the board of a known corrupt gas company in Ukraine to shelter it from prosecutors. Hunter Biden had only resigned from the Burisma board a few months before the July 25 phone call, just prior to when his dad announced his run for the Presidency in 2019.&nbsp;  After the July 25 phone call, Attorney General Barr did not have any follow up meetings or calls with Ukrainian officials. Rudy Giuliani did have additional conversations with Ukrainian officials, which are legal to do since he is a private attorney representing the President.&nbsp;  Text of July 25, 2019 Phone Call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky:  The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.  President Zelensky: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.   The President: (laughter) That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.  President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.   The President: Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she &#183;doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.  President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.  The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.  President Zelensky: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.. That I can assure you.   The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.  President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.  The President: Well, she's going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.  President Zelensky: I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for your support.  The President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.  The President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. President.   The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.  President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.   &nbsp;  Based on a whistleblower report about the July 25 call, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the report on September 13 and started its impeachment inquiry on September 24.&nbsp;  Senate Trial  House Managers&#8217; Case for Impeachment&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, House Managers stated their belief that the President had carried out a &#8220;scheme to cheat in the 2020 election&#8221; by withholding financial aid to Ukraine and withholding a White House meeting with the new President of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine announcing it would investigate Joe Biden, Burisma, and 2016 election interference.  Let's discuss the facts of both.&nbsp;  White House Meeting&nbsp;  There is no question that President Trump had offered a White House meeting to President Zelensky three times: once in May on a phone call after President Zelensky won his election, once in June in a letter, and finally in the July 25th call after President Zelensky&#8217;s party won the parliamentary elections. But Tim Morrison (a State Department official called as a witness by the House) also testified that they were working on heads-of-state meetings with twelve other heads of state during that same time period. Many nations were trying to line up meetings in the White House during the summer of 2019.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, President Zelensky offered to instead move their meeting from a White House meeting to a face-to-face meeting in Warsaw, Poland, when they would both be there on September 1, 2019. The Presidents agreed, and planning began on the meeting in August. By August 22, the meeting planning was in full swing as noted by emails in the House hearing&#8217;s evidence. However, Hurricane Dorian slammed into the US in the hours leading up to the September 1 meeting, causing a last-minute shift to the Vice President traveling to Poland so the President could stay in the US to monitor hurricane relief.&nbsp;  We know that Vice President Pence met face-to-face with President Zelensky, and they spoke about other nations paying their fair share to help Ukraine and the issue of corruption across Ukraine. We know from the preparation materials and the meeting notes themselves that during the meeting the Vice President did not bring up or discuss the issue of Burisma, Joe Biden, or any other campaign conversation with President Zelensky.&nbsp;  The White House found the next available time when President Trump and President Zelensky would both be in the same place at the same time to set up a face-to-face meeting: September 25 at the UN Assembly in New York. That meeting was set up, and it took place as scheduled.&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, the House managers maintained that only a White House meeting was sufficient and that it was being withheld, but the facts show that President Zelensky himself floated the idea of a meeting in Poland and that the meeting was not barred or withheld.&nbsp;  In the early months of President Zelensky&#8217;s term, there was a great deal of concern about him, his staff, and his plans because he was an unknown political figure. Until more was known about him, it was entirely appropriate to show caution in coordinating a meeting, but once his nationwide anti-corruption efforts began in August, it was clear that face-to-face meetings were planned and carried out.&nbsp;  There was no withholding of a face-to-face meeting with President Trump and President Zelensky. There cannot be a quid pro quo if the meeting was not withheld from Ukrainian officials.&nbsp;  Foreign Aid to Ukraine  The House Managers claimed that there was a secret plot to &#8220;extort&#8221; or &#8220;bribe&#8221; the leadership of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden in exchange for around $400 million of US aid. The aid was State Department and foreign military aid that had been provided for the past four years, since Ukraine had been in a war with Russia.&nbsp;  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its occupation of Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the US started sending aid to help the Ukrainian government. Congress allowed lethal and non-lethal aid to support Ukraine, but during the previous administration, only non-lethal aid was sent. Under President Trump&#8217;s administration, it was determined that the United States would give the leadership of Ukraine lethal aid to help them fight off Russian tanks, which was President Zelensky&#8217;s reference to &#8220;javelins&#8221; in the July 25th phone call and his gratitude to President Trump for allowing those tank killing rockets to flow to Ukraine.&nbsp;  To be clear, the theory of funds being withheld from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation does not originate from the July 25 call read out. There is nothing in the text of the call that threatens the withholding of funds in exchange for an investigation.&nbsp;  The theory originates from the fact that aid was held back by the Office of Management and Budget, headed by the President&#8217;s Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and the &#8220;presumption&#8221; of US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that the aid must have been held because of the President&#8217;s desire to get the Biden investigation done, since the President&#8217;s attorney, Rudy Giuliani was working to find out more about the Biden investigation.&nbsp;  Ambassador Sondland told multiple people about his theory, but when he finally called President Trump and asked him directly about it, the President responded that he did not have any quid pro quo, he just wanted the President of Ukraine to do what he ran on and &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221; Obviously, people who assume the worst about President Trump take this as a secret message that there actually was a quid pro quo, but the most important fact is that Ambassador Sondland did not read it that way after his call with the President. Ambassador Sondland believed that the President was serious. Unfortunately, the White House Counsel was never allowed to cross examine Ambassador Sondland during the House investigation to get the facts about who he talked to and why he came to believe for a while that there was an effort to push for investigations in exchange for money.&nbsp;  During the Senate trial, I listened closely to the facts surrounding the withholding of aid money to Ukraine. This was by far the most serious charge against the President. Two key questions had to be answered for me: why was the aid held, and why was the aid released. There was no question the aid was held for a couple of months. The question was why?&nbsp;  Statements from the House witnesses during the House impeachment inquiry answered the two key questions: the aid was held because there was a legitimate concern about the new President of Ukraine and his administration in the early days of his presidency and the aid was released on time when the new Ukrainian Parliament starting passing anti-corruption laws in August and after Vice President Pence sat down face to face with President Zelensky on September 1 in Poland to discuss their progress on corruption.&nbsp;  We should not lose track of what was happening in Ukraine in 2019. A new President was elected who was a TV actor with no political experience and no record on how he would handle Russia or the issue of widespread national corruption in Ukraine. He ran on a platform of anti-corruption at all levels, but no one knew how he would govern. His campaign was funded by a Ukrainian oligarch who owned a major media outlet, and one of his first advisers was the former attorney for that oligarch.&nbsp;  I personally spoke to many of the State Department officials in Ukraine in May of 2019 and heard their concerns about the new government. Then, newly elected President Zelensky used his power to dissolve their Parliament the day he was sworn in and called for &#8220;snap elections&#8221; in which the vast majority of the newly elected leaders were from his newly formed party. To our State Department and the White House, this was either a really a good sign or a really bad sign. Either Ukraine was about to take a major change for the better with new leadership, or this new young leader was about to assume real centralized power. No one knew for certain in May, June, and July of 2019. Within a few weeks in August, the new Parliament got to work passing anti-corruption laws and making significant changes in their accountability and for the country. This was a very good sign.&nbsp;  When Vice President Pence met face to face with President Zelensky September 1, both sides had confidence the country was taking a new direction. On September 10 Vice President Pence and Senator Rob Portman met with President Trump to tell him about the progress that had been made, and both advised lifting the hold on aid. The aid was lifted the next day, September 11. No investigation into Hunter Biden or Burisma was ever done by Ukraine, and no part of the US Department of Justice was ever involved in any investigation of Hunter Biden or Burisma.&nbsp;  Though the aid was frozen in June, there was no public announcement of the hold, as explained by the White House Counsel, to keep this from becoming a public issue while the White House monitored the progress and status of the transition in Ukraine.&nbsp;  On August 27, Politico published an article that noted that the foreign aid had been held by the US. This caused President Zelensky&#8217;s office to reach out to the State Department and ask why. During the House impeachment proceedings, four of the House witnesses (Ambassador Voelker, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor, and Tim Morrison) all testified that the Ukrainian leadership learned about the temporary hold in aid after the Politico article was published.&nbsp;  The issue of the hold was also the first question from President Zelensky to Vice President Pence when they met September 1 in Poland. The idea that the leadership in Ukraine had pressure placed on them to do an investigation fails the most essential test, did the leadership of Ukraine even know that the aid was being held? The answer from multiple American and Ukrainian leaders was no, they did not know there was a hold on the aid from the White House. You cannot have pressure to act on an investigation, if they did not even know the aid was being held.&nbsp;  It is interesting to note, when I researched the records of past foreign aid payment dates and times to Ukraine, I found the 2019 aid was in line with the date the 2016, 2017, and 2018 aid was sent. The vast majority of the military aid to Ukraine was obligated in August or September for the past four years. Though the aid was ready to go out the door a couple months earlier in 2019, it was certainly not late, based on the record of the previous three years. In fact, the State Department aid was obligated September 30 in 2019, but it was obligated September 28 in 2018. As quoted by the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, &#8220;the aid was held such a short time, we did not even notice.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the two days of question-and-answer time, I asked a specific question related to this issue because I felt it was important to get the context of the aid, since there had been so much made of the issue during the trial. Here is the full text of my question to the White House Counsel:&nbsp; House Managers have described any delay in military aid and state department funds to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in September and in 2017, 73% of the funds were obligated in September. In the State Department, the funds were obligated September 30 in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 in 2018. Each year, the vast majority of the funds were obligated in the final month or days of the fiscal year. Question: Was there a national security risk to Ukraine or the United States from the funds going out late in September in the two previous years? Did it weaken our relationship with Ukraine because the vast majority of our aid was released in September each of the last three years?&nbsp;  In response to my question, White House Counsel detailed the fact that military aid from the US was not for immediate use. It was designed to help the Ukrainian military buy materials for the next year, so it was common for the aid to be obligated at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), and it was also common for some money to be left unobligated and carried over into the next fiscal year, as it was in 2019.&nbsp;  While it is easy to create an intricate story on the hold placed on foreign aid to Ukraine, it is also clear that President Trump has temporarily held foreign aid from multiple countries over the past two years, including: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Lebanon, and others. There is no question that a President can withhold aid for a short period of time, but it must be released by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, which it was in this instance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Constitutional Issues Around This Impeachment  Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants the US House of Representatives &#8220;the sole power of impeachment,&#8221; while Article I, Section 3 states that &#8220;the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.&#8221;&nbsp;  The Constitution is clear that the House does not control the Senate process and the Senate does not control the House process. However, during the impeachment trial of President Trump, the House tried repeatedly to dictate to the Senate how it should conduct its trial.&nbsp;  The &#8220;sole power to try&#8221; means laying out rules for the trial, including when and if to call additional witnesses or request more documents.&nbsp;  In addition to laying out roles and responsibilities for impeachment, our Constitution also provides basic rights for the accused. The Fifth Amendment ensures due process. However, the receipt of due process is not contingent upon waiving another right, like immunity or executive privilege. But that is exactly what the House tried to force President Trump to do.&nbsp;  The President is not above the law, but neither is the House of Representatives. If there was a question as to the scope and proper use of the President&#8217;s right to assert immunity or executive privilege regarding conversations he had with his closest advisers, that question is proper for a court to determine, not Congress, and surely not the House on its own accord. To put this in constitutional terms, the Legislative Branch cannot prevent the Executive Branch from having access to the Judicial Branch. The House wanted to move quickly and prevent the President from ever going to court to resolve any issue. That has never been done for a good reason, the separation of powers. In previous legal battles with the President, it has taken months to resolve critical issues, like Bush v. Gore in 2000 or even in the Clinton impeachment trial, when the House took two months to resolve an issue with witnesses in court. It does not have to drag on for years.&nbsp;  The House also wanted the Chief Justice of the United States to &#8220;rule on&#8221; any issue quickly, instead of allowing the President to go through the courts. This would have created a new judicial executive branch by putting all the judicial power of the nation in one person, not in the Judicial Branch, as is stated in the Constitution. It would have also ignored the text of the Constitution where it notes that the Chief Justice &#8220;presides&#8221; in the court of impeachment, not &#8220;decides.&#8221; The sole power of impeachment is in the Senate, not the Senate, plus the one Justice. The Chief Justice keeps the trial moving along, based on the rules of the trial, but he or she is not a decider of fact, that is reserved to the Senate. The House Managers wanted to ignore that part of the Constitution to move the trial faster for expedience. We cannot ignore the Constitution or create bad precedent, no matter which party is being tried for impeachment.&nbsp;  Further, the Sixth Amendment guarantees that the accused has the ability to both confront the witnesses against him and to have the assistance of counsel. The majority of the impeachment inquiry in the House was done without a meaningful opportunity for the president to participate and administration witnesses were denied the ability to have counsel present for depositions.&nbsp;  The Constitution lays out a clear separation of powers, but importantly also provides a system of checks and balances. For something as important as impeachment, it is imperative that the process be one that is squarely within the bounds of the Constitution and is one that the American people can trust. Unfortunately, the process undertaken by the House to impeach President Trump falls wildly short of the standards put in place by our Founders.&nbsp;  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that &#8220;the President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the trial of President Trump, there was a lot of conversation about what constitutes a &#8220;high crime&#8221; or &#8220;misdemeanor.&#8221; Notably, the House did not charge the President with any crimes. Rather, the House chose to impeach the President for &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; and &#8220;obstruction of Congress.&#8221;&nbsp;  The House theoretically could have chosen to file articles of impeachment for crimes such as bribery, extortion, solicitation of interference in an election, or violations of the Impoundments Clause Act. For any of these crimes, the House would have had to prove specific elements of each. Since they couldn&#8217;t prove any of those crimes, they chose to charge the President with &#8220;abuse of power.&#8221; As was noted in the trial, forty Presidents have faced accusation of &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; going back as far as George Washington.&nbsp;  The abuse of power charge for President Trump was based on allegations that he improperly withheld aid to Ukraine and conditioned a meeting with President Zelensky at the White House in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Over the course of the last four months, we heard the term quid pro quo used over and over again but the facts do not show criminal quid pro quo. As previously mentioned, President Zelensky asked to meet with President Trump in Poland and that meeting was set up. Further, while the aid to Ukraine was delayed, it wasn&#8217;t delayed more than it had been the previous two years, and the aid was released without an investigation (or even an announcement of one) into the Biden&#8217;s.&nbsp;  The second article of impeachment, Obstruction of Congress, had an even weaker constitutional foundation. The investigation was announced September 24, but did not officially begin until October 31. The impeachment vote in the House was December 18. This very short time table and the accusation that the President refused to follow the law, honor the courts and that he acted like a &#8220;King&#8221; did not meet even the most basic constitutional standards for justice.&nbsp;  For example, during the Mueller investigation, the President&#8217;s team fully cooperated with the investigation that included over 2,000 subpoenas and 500 witnesses, including the President&#8217;s Chief of Staff, multiple cabinet officials and many lower-level officials that were all made available. It was clear throughout the investigation that the President did not like or agree with the Mueller investigation, but he also fully cooperated with every subpoena, each witness and every document. In fact, they released over a million pages of documents to the Mueller team.&nbsp;  President Trump also made his disagreement with the courts very clear on issues like the census, whether travel restrictions can be put in place to ensure national security, or whether particular funds can be used to secure our southern border. But, each time the President lost in court, his Administration complied with orders from the Judiciary. That is how our system of government is supposed to work.&nbsp;  When disagreements happen between the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch, they usually lead to resolution, not impeachment. The Fast and Furious investigation, which lasted more than three years in the Obama Administration, led to a vote in the House to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, but it never led to an impeachment inquiry, even though there was a clear and consistent refusal to cooperate with Congress or turn over key documents for three years.&nbsp;  In this case the accusation that President Trump ignored subpoenas or refused to follow the law is not correct. The President&#8217;s team made it very clear that they would cooperate during the impeachment inquiry with properly authorized and issued subpoenas, but the House refused to issue subpoenas that were consistent with the law to seek resolution for documents and witnesses. The House was focused on speed, not legal process.&nbsp;  The House, in a rush to impeachment last fall, issued multiple subpoenas for documents and testimony before the House had given authority to the committees to issue subpoenas for an impeachment inquiry, which happened October 31. Since there was no authority to issue the subpoenas, they were not duly authorized. The House also demanded testimony from the President&#8217;s inner circle without working through the legal questions and the House demanded Executive Agency witnesses appear without allowing them to bring Agency counsel with them. All of those issues created very real legal and constitutional problems. Agency individuals have always been allowed to have legal counsel with them when they are deposed, except this time.&nbsp;  As a Member of Congress, I cannot demand the President turn over documents or give testimony in any fashion that I would prefer, just because I have oversight responsibilities. In the same way, the President or other Executive Branch officials cannot demand I turn over my notes or provide my staff for testimony without going through the courts and gaining a legal subpoena. Congress has vigorously and rightfully protected its rights from unwarranted investigations from any president. And presidents have done the same. But in all cases, the law must be followed and the proper process must be pursued to get the information in a legal way.&nbsp;  Additional Witnesses  From the very first moments of the Senate trial, the House Managers fought for additional witnesses and documents from the President. Their argument, and justification for the second article of impeachment, centered on the White House&#8217;s refusal to turn over documents and make every witness available without going through the normal legal process.&nbsp;  Per the resolution adopted by the Senate, the House record was part of the trial record. The Senate had the testimony of the witnesses the House chose to question as part of the overall information of the trial. The House already had 28,000 pages of documents that were part of the evidence they submitted to the Senate. Although, the House Managers admitted during the Senate impeachment trial that they still have not released all of the documents and witness testimony that they had gathered in their investigation to the White House Counsel or to the Senate. We do not fully know why the House held back some of its witness testimony and released others.&nbsp;  The House witness testimony was used extensively in the Senate trial.  Witnesses who testified live or via video in the House and Senate Impeachment:&nbsp;  David Holmes, Political Counselor, US Embassy Ukraine, State Department&nbsp; Dr. Fiona Hill, White House Adviser, National Security Council David Hale, Undersecretary for Political Affairs, State Department&nbsp; Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense&nbsp; Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union&nbsp; Tim Morison, Former White House Advisor&nbsp; Kurt Voelker, Former Special Envoy for Ukraine&nbsp; Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, National Security Council&nbsp; Jennifer Williams, Aide to the Vice President&nbsp; Marie Yovanovitch, Former Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp; George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State&nbsp; Bill Taylor, Former United States Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp;  The House Managers repeated over and over that additional witnesses would only take a week to depose, which is a clearly false statement. New witnesses took longer than a week to depose in the House inquiry, clearly it would take just as long or longer in a Senate trial. The remaining &#8220;wish list&#8221; of witnesses all had clear issues that needed to be resolved in the courts, which would take a couple of months to resolve, which is why the House Managers did not push for their testimony in the House impeachment process, they valued speed more than legal process.&nbsp;  House Managers repeatedly stated that witnesses only took a week to depose in the Clinton Senate impeachment trial, but they know that during the Clinton Senate trial all three called witnesses previously deposed in the House inquiry or in the Grand Jury investigation and all issues of Executive privilege had already been decided through the courts. There were no new witnesses in the Senate trial of President Clinton. Also, the Clinton White House had already had the opportunity to cross examine witnesses or the investigators in the Clinton impeachment inquiry; this time the Trump White House had been denied that right. So, if new witnesses would be added for the Senate trial, the White House should have the right to also cross examine the previous House witnesses that they had been denied the right to cross examine in the past. This would all take much longer than a week and the House Managers knew that.&nbsp;  During the Clinton Impeachment trial in the Senate, there were no additional documents requested, only previously deposed witnesses. The House Managers did not go through the legal process to get documents, like the Mueller investigation had done, so all of the new document requests from the House Managers would take at least three to five weeks to complete, once a legal subpoena is delivered. It takes time to search all databases, review the documents for classified materials, determine any legal issues, and release them to the investigation. Once the documents are turned over, both legal teams need time to review the documents. Again, the House Managers knew these facts, but they continued to repeat over and over that it would only take a week to get all the documents.&nbsp;  The first question for the Senate trial was: do we have enough evidence and testimony to answer the questions the House presented in their articles of impeachment? If the answer is yes, then we do not need additional witnesses or documents. If the answer is no, then we do need additional information. There were many leaks and newspaper stories during the trial designed to push the Senate to vote to ask for more testimony, but that did not change the primary question. We already knew from evidence that there was no quid pro quo, no Ukrainian investigations and no withholding of a public meeting with President Trump.&nbsp;  The New York Times story on January 26 and again on January 31 are clear examples of an attempt to bring doubt on the information and witness testimony. Both stories stated that someone had read the pending John Bolton book manuscript and that in the book Bolton stated that President Trump had talked about investigations in exchange for aid funding for Ukraine. The New York Times also wrote that the book would state that Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, were also a part of the scheme. I looked at both stories closely and noticed that the reporters had not read the manuscripts or quoted the manuscripts; they were reports from someone who stated that they had read the manuscripts. Both stories took significant liberties to describe the intent in the manuscripts, but the reporter had apparently also not spoken to John Bolton.&nbsp;  On January 23, 2020, the National Security Council lawyers sent a letter to the legal team handling the book publishing for John Bolton to inform him that the manuscript contained some classified information and it would need have some edits before publication in March. Then, on January 26, the New York Times published a story that someone had leaked some of the details of the book, but they had not released the actual manuscript. While I am interested in seeing the actual manuscript, I am also very aware that this selective leak was designed by The&nbsp;New York Times and whoever leaked the information to influence the ongoing trial.&nbsp;  It was clear from the earliest days of the trial that the House had a clear political strategy as well as a court-room strategy. During the trial I had the responsibility to hear the facts but also to separate the politics from the facts. Politically, it was best for the House to move as quickly as possible through impeachment so that vulnerable Democratic members could vote for impeachment, and then move quickly to other topics. But since the presidential election is in full swing, it was politically better for Democrats to make the Senate trial move as slow as possible to hurt the President during the campaign. That explains why the House did not take the time to formally request documents or testimony from many individuals; they needed to move fast and try to force the Senate to move slowly. It also explained why the House passed impeachment on a party line vote, then held the articles of impeachment for a month before delivering them to the Senate to start the trial. The House Managers said repeatedly that the evidence was clear and that they had proved their case. But, if that was true, why would the Senate need to call additional witnesses? I think the reason is that the witness process was about delay, more than facts.&nbsp;  Final Thoughts  The facts do not support the accusation in the Trump impeachment, and it certainly did not need to come to this moment of national division. While, it was clear that the House Managers wanted to drag the trial on for months in the Senate, through the primary election season, their case consisted of hypothetical story lines and &#8220;presumptions&#8221; more than facts that warrant the removal of a President. This does not meet what Alexander Hamilton in Federalist, No. 65 described as the &#8220;due weight&#8221; for the arguments.&nbsp;  But impeachment has certainly created the division in our society that Alexander Hamilton predicted. Over 200 years ago he wrote, &#8220;The prosecution [of impeachments], will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.&#8221; This has been an incredibly divisive season in our nation. It is not about one person, it is about all of us. We individually choose how we handle disagreements with family, friends, and people on the other side of particular issues. Our government represents us, so it is up to us to model for our government how to handle disagreements.&nbsp;  We are now past impeachment, and it's time to work on the issues that matter most to the American people. As we move forward, every American should speak out on the issues that are important to them and the voices that speak for their point of view. But, we should remember that we have much more in common than we have that divides us. It is my hope that our nation does not go through a season like this again for a very long time and that we can move past this age of impeachment to an age of oversight and accountability.&nbsp;  I appreciate all the engagement with our office during the impeachment proceedings. We had thousands of calls and emails over the past month. We had hundreds of thousands of views on the nightly Facebook Live updates each day during the trial. While not every Oklahoman agrees with every decision I make on behalf of our state, I am grateful most choose to be respectful in expressing their points of view. At the end of the day, we are Oklahomans. We may not all agree on each issue, but we can be respectful of each other in our disagreement.&nbsp;  I am honored to serve our state and nation. We have many important issues to address in the coming days, I pray we can work on them together for the future of our state and nation.

I first met Sandy in 2012 when I was her Congressman. She came to talk to me about her son, Lance Corporal Alec Terwiske, who was killed in action that September by an improvised explosive device while serving as a Marine in Afghanistan. Since then, I have worn a bracelet in honor of Alec. I promised Sandy that when I wear it I will remember Alec, and all of the fallen and their sacrifices. &nbsp;During last year&#8217;s State of the Union, I gave President Trump one of Alec&#8217;s bracelets. This year, I was honored to have Sandy attend the President&#8217;s speech as my guest.&nbsp;We sat down to discuss Alec and the importance of honoring Gold Star families.

State of the Union Reaction Last week, President Trump delivered an optimistic message about the great successes we have achieved over the last three years and the work that remains in order to keep America strong. Spurred by lower taxes, fewer regulations, and emerging trade deals, we are poised to continue this period of economic growth. More people are working than ever, and this economic surge is creating new opportunities for people of every background. It is critical that we continue, and build upon, this momentum.&nbsp; President Trump also outlined the work that remains to support working families, including lowering the cost of health care and prescription drug prices. I will continue working with the President and my colleagues in Congress to tackle these challenges. The address provided a clear contrast between the Republican policies that are working for American families and the socialist policies being championed by national Democrats on the far left, which would lead to higher taxes, fewer jobs, and less freedom. It&#8217;s clear that Republicans offer a better path forward for a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America, and I look forward to continue working with President Trump on behalf of Hoosiers and all Americans.  Tackling the Truck Driver Shortage&nbsp; I&#8217;ve heard from truck drivers and businesses across Indiana about the impact of our nation&#8217;s truck driver shortage. Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with trucking industry experts on how my DRIVE-Safe Act will address the driver shortage, create jobs for young Hoosiers, and increase safety on our roads.

Constituent Spotlight: 102-Year-Old Hoosier Veteran After more than 56 years at the Department of Natural Resources, Hoosier Bob Vollmer has finally retired at 102 years old. This World War II veteran has surveyed significant swaths of Indiana&#8217;s countryside and his service will benefit our state for years to come. I wish him fair winds and following seas as he moves into the next chapter of his life.&nbsp;Learn more about Bob&#8217;s inspiring story in WTHR&#8217;s article: &#8220;At 102 years old, state worker finally ready to retire&#8221;.  USMCA Signed into Law Now that President Trump has signed the&nbsp;USMCA Implementation Act&nbsp;into law, Hoosiers have the certainty needed to grow businesses, create jobs, and increase exports.&nbsp;Over 60,000 manufacturing jobs in Indiana are directly tied to trade with our closest neighbors, and our 94,000 farmers will be able to increase exports by $2.2 billion with this historic agreement.&nbsp;I look forward to seeing USMCA fully implemented over the coming months.  The USMCA will not only modernize the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) but also support freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North America. &nbsp;: Photo Review&nbsp;   For an overview of the last week in photos,&nbsp;click here&nbsp;or the image above.

The President&#8217;s State of the Union address detailed the incredible accomplishments America has achieved in the last year. Our middle class is booming and the unemployment rate is as low as it&#8217;s been in half a century. Seven million jobs have been created under his leadership, and in Missouri, real median household income is up eight percent. The economy continues to grow, lifting up working families and creating greater opportunities for the next generation. President Trump has said he would get to work for America, and he told us all how he has kept that promise. He has made it a priority to lower prescription drug costs, secure our border, and combat human trafficking. I will continue to work with him for our suburban families to advance critical initiatives such as passing paid parental leave legislation, addressing the skyrocketing costs of childcare, and ensuring our national security remains strong. Now that President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment, it is time Congress got back to the People&#8217;s business of governing and build on his record of achievements for the American people. Read my State of the Union press release here. I introduced&nbsp;bipartisan legislation with my colleagues to help prevent repeated community flooding. We must help regions at risk of repeat flooding become more resilient. By incentivizing communities to plan ahead for damaging floods, we can avoid continually subsidizing the rebuilding of flood-prone properties through the National Flood Insurance Program. This bill aims to prevent loss of life and property and help communities withstand major floods like those we have recently experienced in Missouri. Read more about the bill here. Republicans introduced a privileged resolution to admonish the Speaker for ripping up the President&#8217;s State of the Union address. Her action was a slap in the face to the President, the dignity of the House, and all of the Americans the President honored in his speech. Democrats should allow us to vote on this legislation so they can go on record and tell the country whether they support such behavior or not.   I had the honor of singing in the National Prayer Breakfast Congressional Choir with my colleagues.&nbsp;This is such a moving event, and I was blessed to attend.   It was great speaking to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) to discuss our work in Congress against human trafficking. Financial institutions are critical partners in the fight against trafficking, and I look forward to working with banks, non-profits, and law enforcement as we find new ways to identify traffickers and help victims find justice. I was honored to receive an award from ACAMS for my work in the fight against trafficking and appreciate their support and partnership.   The purpose of U.S. global health and economic development programming is to recognize, promote, and protect the dignity of all individuals, and to extend a helping hand so that the marginalized, poor, and vulnerable around the world may build a better future. Abortion is not compatible with this mission. Children and families should not be enumerated as barriers to prosperity, but seen as sources of strength, beauty, purpose, meaning, and potential. We will not make the challenge of ending poverty a &#8220;little simpler&#8221; in the short term by pushing women to end the lives of their children. Instead, we will continue to ensure that all women and children have access to healthcare, opportunity, and success. During our Foreign Affairs hearing on women and global health, I asked our witnesses how we can better help women have both their baby and their dreams. We also discussed how abortion is a key driver of gendercide, the global epidemic of violence against women and girls.    I had a great visit with kids from Step Up St. Louis and the Jefferson County Drug Prevention Coalition to talk about the many ways they are working to educate students on the many dangers of addiction and how they can identify the signs.&nbsp;   Sincerely,   Ann WagnerMember of Congress                                        Washington, DC Office2350 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: 202-225-1621    Ballwin District Office301 Sovereign CourtSuite 201Ballwin, MO 63011Phone: 636-779-5449               Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email If you no longer want to receive these emails, please click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to unsubscribe.&nbsp; Please DO NOT reply to this email.

Whether through tax reform, trade deals, deregulation, a secured border, a rebuilt military, or America&#8217;s energy revolution, the President&#8217;s record of delivering real results for the American people cannot be denied. Now it&#8217;s time to put division aside, work with President Trump, and renew our focus on tackling unifying issues like infrastructure, education, and high prescription drug costs. In case you missed it, watch&nbsp;President Trump&#8217;s address here.&nbsp;    _____________________________________________________________  President Trump Acquitted   The Senate voted to acquit President Trump after a long, partisan process. Shortly before the vote, I went to the Senate Floor to give my closing remarks on the impeachment trial and to announce I would be voting to acquit the President. The two articles which came before the Senate were without merit. They were an affront to the institution and to our Constitution, representing the very same partisan derangement that worried our Founding Fathers so much that they made the threshold for impeachment this high. I did not arrive at my conclusion to support acquittal hastily or flippantly, and I don&#8217;t believe any of my colleagues did either, including those who come to a different conclusion from mine. Watch my remarks below.    _____________________________________________________________  Clarifying WPA Easement Director&#8217;s Order  Robert Wallace, the U.S. Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks joined a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee oversight hearing in which we discussed the recent Director&#8217;s Order on Waterfowl Production Area (WPA) Easements. I chair the EPW Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife and at the hearing, sought clarification on the process of implementing the Order, the expected timeline, the newly-established appeals process, and the future release of these maps.    The Director&#8217;s Order addresses a longstanding and serious problem for many North Dakota landowners. The Order is the direct result of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt&#8217;s visit to Hope, North Dakota, last October&nbsp;where he heard directly from landowners. The Order promises new maps overlaid on aerial imagery, detailing the boundaries and acreage of its easements to landowners, and provides the first-ever administrative appeals process for landowners who have FWS easements pre-dating 1976 on their property. I wrote a Letter to the Editor for the Minot Daily News, outlining what North Dakotans whose lands have these pre-1976 WPA easements should expect. The success of this first-ever appeals process depends on public involvement. Read my piece here.  _____________________________________________________________  USDA Issues Third Round of MFP Payments   The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the third and final tranche of 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments. I&#8217;m grateful to President Trump and Secretary Perdue for their continued support for American agriculture. These payments come at an important time for our producers, who face uncertainty in the Chinese market. The Trump Administration&#8217;s recognition of our producers as a target of unfair retaliation is noticed and appreciated. _____________________________________________________________  Migratory Bird Treaty Act  President Trump&#8217;s Administration released a proposed rule&nbsp;to define the scope of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Under the Obama Administration&#8217;s interpretation of the MBTA, anyone could be prosecuted without even making a deliberate effort to kill species protected by the MBTA. Had it not been stopped in court, this interpretation would have had severely negative consequences for North Dakotans. The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee discussed the proposed rule during a Fish &amp; Wildlife Service oversight hearing. In North Dakota, we had three oil companies zealously prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office over 28 birds that inadvertently flew into the company&#8217;s pits. These companies were lawfully practicing commercial activities and never intentionally sought to harm these birds, yet they were criminally prosecuted. The previous US Attorney&#8217;s actions against these companies and workers were more of a representation of their hatred of the industry than it was the love of birds. The new proposal is common sense and I applaud the Trump Administration&#8217;s efforts.&nbsp;Watch the exchange here.&nbsp;  _____________________________________________________________  Discussing ISR and Space Force at SASC  During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the U.S. Southern Command Commander Adm. Craig Faller and U.S. Africa Command Commander Gen. Stephen Townsend came in to discuss their needs for the upcoming fiscal year. During this time, I addressed their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) needs like those provided by the MQ-9 in Fargo and the Global Hawks in Grand Forks. Each Commander reported receiving 25 percent or less of the ISR capabilities they need. I also inquired as to how the newly created U.S. Space Force could assist in their respective missions. Our full exchange is below.    _____________________________________________________________  Introducing Teleabortion Prevention Act I joined Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana to introduce the Teleabortion Prevention Act, which would make it a federal offense for healthcare providers to perform a chemical abortion without first physically examining the patient, being present during the chemical abortion, and scheduling a follow-up visit for the patient. Proponents of abortion say it should be a safe, rare decision made between a mother and a qualified doctor, but now there is a movement to provide abortions with little-to-no consultation with a physician. Killing an unborn child is wrong, and encouraging women to undergo that procedure without knowing the impact is egregious. Our pro-life legislation counters these efforts and works to protect mothers and unborn children. _____________________________________________________________  North Dakotans in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;    It's always nice to see my friends from Grain Growers in Washington. We covered a wide range of topics affecting them, including RMA issues, WPA easements, MFP payments, wetland setbacks, and the Phase One trade deal with China.   Visiting with North Dakota&#8217;s Tribal College students is one of my favorite meetings every year. I&#8217;m inspired by their stories and grateful for our time together. We discussed issues unique to tribal colleges including broadband, cultural education and degree programs. _____________________________________________________________  Contact Me  My offices are open in Bismarck, Grand Forks, Minot, Fargo and Washington, D.C.

A question was recently raised during a Facebook Town Hall that I hosted that asked how to protect yourself against the spread of the Coronavirus.  As you may know, the Coronavirus is a recently discovered virus that has spread to infect hundreds of people in China. While there have not been any reported cases in Connecticut it is always important to be vigilant. Here is what you need to remember as state and federal officials monitor the situation.  While vigilance is key, there is no cause for panic.  Take normal precautions as you would during flu season, which includes:   Regularly washing your hands&nbsp; Staying home from work or school if you&#8217;re feeling sick Sneezing and coughing into your elbow Cleaning frequently touched objects and surfaces  You can learn more about how you can help protect yourself and other CDC recommendations here. I will keep you updated as more information becomes available.

I have asked from the beginning, \"What was the crime?\" The U.S. Senate has just answered that question. There wasn&#8217;t one.   Democrats&#8217; wasted months on a partisan impeachment fueled by their hatred for President Trump.  &nbsp;  THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG  This past week, President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address. During his speech, the President reiterated that the state of our union is strong &#8211; our economy continues to grow, more Americans are back to work, our military remains the best fighting force in the world, and U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses have a more level playing field in our global markets. Following the President&#8217;s speech, I sent out a poll to hear from constituents on how well they thought the President delivered his policy agenda and the top issues from his address that were important to you.&nbsp;Below are the results of our poll.&nbsp; If you missed the survey, you can click here to take it now. You can also call my Washington, D.C. office to express your opinions, or send me an email through my website by clicking here.&nbsp;  If you missed his State of the Union address, you can watch here.   &nbsp;    &nbsp; MEETING WITH SPECIALTY AG GROUPS  This week, I had the opportunity to meet with National Sorghum Producers Association and the National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance to hear their concerns on issues facing each respective industry.&nbsp; I look forward to continuing to meet with ag groups from across our country to learn more about their unique challenges as I run to lead to the House Agriculture Committee&#8217;s Republican side next Congress.    I appreciate the National Sorghum Producers Association meeting with me to discuss trade and reforms to crop insurance programs.  &nbsp;    During my meeting with the National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance, we discussed disaster programs and how we can enhance them.   &nbsp;  HERE TO HELP  As always, my staff and I are here to help.

I was proud to stand in defense of citizens' right-to-work and opposed legislation seeking to force people to join a labor union to get or keep a job. It was also a pleasure to have so many different groups from across the Sixth District join me in Washington this week to advocate for the issues they care most about. With impeachment officially behind us, I am hopeful Congress can move past partisanship and spend the next year working for the American people.&nbsp;  President Acquitted:  From the beginning, Speaker Pelosi said that impeachment must be compelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan. However, the impeachment of President Trump did not possess any of these qualities. The flawed and rushed process conducted in the House, coupled with the lack of evidence required to prove high crimes and misdemeanors, made the acquittal of President Trump by the Senate appropriate and necessary. The impeachment process in the House was a sham, and it set a dangerous precedent that we must reject moving forward. Never again can we allow one political party to use impeachment as a tool for political gain. This entire process has been little more than an attempt by Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election and the will of 63 million Americans &#8211; all while denying the President his right to due process. The partisanship displayed by some of my colleagues has fueled the rancor and division within this country, and this entire display of political theater will forever be remembered as a sad stain on the House of Representatives. After wasting months focusing on impeachment, I am hopeful that Congress can now get back to work on issues important to the American people, including improving our Nation&#8217;s infrastructure and highways, supporting our military and veterans&#8217; programs, securing our border and preventing the flood of drugs and human trafficking that has flowed across it, and finding solutions to bring down the costs of health insurance and prescription drugs.         State of the Union:&nbsp; After an eventful few months, President Trump gave his annual address to a joint session of Congress this week. He delivered a message that Americans already knew - that the state of our union is strong. Throughout his speech, he laid out a forward-looking and optimistic agenda that will lead to the continued prosperity of this Nation.&nbsp; Over the course of the last three years, President Trump and his Administration have accomplished a great deal for the American people. Above all, President Trump's commitment to cutting bureaucratic red-tape has allowed businesses to thrive and the economy to flourish. Since his swearing in, the United States has added more than 7 million new jobs and a record 160 million people are currently in the workforce. Many of these new jobs have been in the manufacturing sector - a result of more than 12,000 factories opening their doors throughout the President's term. Further, unemployment currently stands at or near-fifty-year lows, including record lows among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Women, and Veterans. The President's landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created opportunity zones to encourage investment in low-income areas, which have lifted nearly 2.5 million Americans out of poverty and risen the median wage for middle-class families by $5,000 a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;  These economic victories can also be seen right here in Virginia. Our Commonwealth's unemployment rate stands at 2.6 percent - a result of the 120,000 new jobs created in the state since President Trump took office.&nbsp;Unemployment insurance claims are down 22 percent since his election and&nbsp;real median household income in Virginia is up 12 percent. The 212 opportunity zones designated in our state have&nbsp;lifted 137,000 Virginians out of poverty and have inspired hope in our struggling communities.&nbsp;  While the economic success our Nation has seen during this Administration is immense, President Trump has secured countless other victories for our country. Not only has he signed new trade deals like USMCA and the Phase One agreement with China, but he has also made significant progress in securing our border, passed historic criminal justice reform legislation, stood for pro-life values, enhanced vocational education, strengthened our military, and taken out numerous terrorists abroad ensuring the safety and security of our Nation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;         Protecting the Right to Organize Act:  This country was founded so that all Americans could have the opportunity to succeed. One way that we promote this is through policies and laws that allow people the right to work, which in turn makes us more competitive in the business market. Thankfully, our Commonwealth is a right-to-work state. And because of this, Virginia was once again ranked as the number one state in which to do business in 2019 by CNBC.&nbsp;  H.R. 2474, which passed the House this week, would inappropriately preempt and prohibit right-to-work laws in 27 states that value and protect this fundamental right. This is unacceptable. In an even further affront to liberty, this bill abhorrently violates the privacy of workers by forcing them to share their personal contact information with union organizers, even when this has been shown to enable harassment and intimidation of those very workers. If signed into law, this bill would have grave impacts on workers and businesses at great cost to the fabric of our workforce. Every American deserves the right to create their own success from their own volition &#8211; free of the requirement that they join an organization solely to hold a job. Simply put, as our Founding Father and fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson said, &#8220;To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.&#8221; I voted against this bill to protect Virginia workers and stand for the freedom and success in which our Founding Fathers believed.&nbsp;         Sixth District in DC:  It is truly always a pleasure to host Sixth District residents in Washington, D.C.

The President and Senate Republicans have normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances enshrined in our Constitution.&nbsp; Our Founders put safeguards in the Constitution to protect against a rogue president.&nbsp; They never imagined that they would at the same time have a rogue leader in the Senate who would cowardly abandon his duty to uphold the Constitution.&nbsp;  &nbsp;         President Trump was impeached with the support of a majority of the American people &#8211; a first in our nation&#8217;s history.&nbsp; And now he is the first President in history to face a bipartisan vote to convict him in the Senate.&nbsp; A full 75 percent of Americans and many members of the GOP Senate believe the President&#8217;s behavior is wrong.&nbsp; But the Senate chose instead to ignore the facts, the will of the American people and their duty to the Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The President will boast that he has been acquitted.&nbsp; There can be no acquittal without a trial, and there is no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence.&nbsp; The President has been impeached forever.&nbsp; Sadly, because of a majority of the Senate&#8217;s betrayal of the Constitution, the President remains an ongoing threat to American democracy, with his insistence that he is above the law and that he can corrupt the elections if he wants to.&nbsp; The House will continue to protect and defend the checks and balances in the Constitution that safeguard our Republic, both in the courts of law and in the court of public opinion.&nbsp; Democrats will continue to defend our democracy For The People.  &nbsp;    Congresswoman Pelosi speaks with Chairman Bobby Scott, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and others in support of the PRO Act to protect workers&#8217; right to organize.  &nbsp;  Fighting for America&#8217;s Workers  This week, the House took bold action to restore fundamental fairness for America&#8217;s workers by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act: one of the most significant legislative victories for workers and unions in decades! Democrats know that the men and women of labor are the backbone of the American economy.&nbsp; The victories of unions have long lifted up all Americans: from the 40-hour workweek to safer working conditions, fair pay to family leave, collective bargaining to a secure retirement.&nbsp; As I always say, America&#8217;s middle class has a union label on it!&nbsp; Yet, for decades, Republicans in courthouses, statehouses and even this House have worked to undermine workers&#8217; rights, including their right to join in union to negotiate better wages, working conditions and futures.&nbsp; This must end!&nbsp;  With the PRO Act, the sacred right of joining a union is protected for all Americans.&nbsp; This bill holds companies that violate workers&#8217; rights accountable with effective, enforceable monetary policies, strengthens workers&#8217; collective bargaining rights including by giving workers the power to override &#8220;right to work&#8221; laws, and protects workers&#8217; access to fair union elections. &nbsp;Since Day One of our Majority, we have fought for workers &#8211; passing a $15 federal minimum wage, securing paycheck fairness for women, protecting the pensions of millions, lowering health care costs and increasing paychecks.&nbsp; We will always fight for hard-working families across America!  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Reviving the Wetlands Over the last 200 years, 90 percent of the Bay Area&#8217;s wetlands have been destroyed by human activity. &nbsp;The San Francisco Bay Estuary, which spans 1,600 square miles and drains more than 40 percent of California&#8217;s water, faces threats from pesticide, invasive species, toxic substances, bacteria and habitat destruction. &nbsp;We know that by 2030, the damage to the San Francisco Bay will be irreversible.  The lack of sufficient federal funding has been one of the biggest risks to long-term restoration efforts needed for the survival of numerous species, including more than 100 endangered species.&nbsp; The House Majority will remain committed to protecting our environment and combating climate change.  That is why, on Wednesday, the House passed Congresswoman Jackie Speier&#8217;s San Francisco Bay Restoration Act, which I cosponsored, that would authorize $25 million annually from 2021 through 2025 to revive Bay Area wetlands, improve water quality and protect coastal communities from sea level rise. &nbsp;The funds would match the $25 million that local Measure AA is expected to raise annually for Bay restoration. &nbsp;These funds will allow us to preserve and restore areas where freshwater rivers and streams meet the ocean. &nbsp;The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;      A constituent contacted my office because he was having trouble with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services due to the U.S. State Department not receiving his documents. &nbsp;After my office submitted an inquiry on his behalf, the State Department was able to resend the approval notice to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The president kicked off the week with the State of the Union Address, then on Wednesday the Senate voted to acquit President Trump, and on Thursday, the president spoke at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, which I was blessed to attend. Keep reading to hear more about the last few days in our nation&#8217;s capital!    In the News Our View: Let Them Go On Faith, The Lakeland Ledger  Veteran Rep. Stands Up for Religious Dog Tags After Pentagon Caved to Secularist Group, The Washington Free Beacon  Greg Steube Wants Armed Forces Personnel to Have Concealed Carry Permits at Military Bases, Florida Daily  Legislative Update The Safe Bases Act Last week, I introduced the Safe Bases Act to give the Department of Defense the authority to issue concealed carry permits for active duty members of the Armed Forces who wish to carry on military installations. As we saw in the recent tragedy in Pensacola, gun free zones are a threat to our safety&#8212;even in the most secure environments. Active duty service members, who have extensive firearm training, should be afforded the opportunity to carry a concealed firearm to defend themselves and others. If we trust them on the battlefield with military equipment and firearms, then we should trust them at home on their installations to defend themselves and civilians working with them.  Moving H-2A to USDA Act On Thursday, I introduced the Moving H-2A to USDA Act to relocate the H-2A visa program from the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor to the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. Farmers across Florida rely on the H-2A visa program each year for temporary agricultural labor. Given that the purpose of the H-2A program is to address agricultural labor needs, it seems only logical that we would rely on the Department of Agriculture to review and grant these visas. It is my hope that with the transfer of this program, farmers in Florida and across America will see expedited review times and an overall improvement in the administration of the program. It&#8217;s time we trust the experts to manage this critical program and ensure the needs of our farmers are being met efficiently and effectively.    This Week in Washington We kicked off this week in Washington with the President&#8217;s State of the Union Address. With wages rising, unemployment dropping, and the economy booming, I am happy to say that the State of our Union is prosperous. The policies proposed by this administration are working for Floridians and Americans and I applaud the president for his steadfast commitment to making America great! After the speech, I spoke with media from across my district about the important issues the president addressed and my takeaways from the evening. Watch one of my interviews here:    On Wednesday, the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump. I applaud the Senate for their decisive action to acquit the president. Since the president was elected, Democrats have stopped at nothing to remove him from office because they know they can&#8217;t beat him at the ballot box. Thankfully, the voters will have the final say on all of this in November. I am hopeful that with this acquittal, we can move forward and get to the business of the American people by addressing real issues facing our nation. This week, I also had the privilege to attend the National Prayer Breakfast with President Trump and many other members of Congress. This is such a special event where we have the opportunity to celebrate our faith and the many blessings the Lord has bestowed upon our great nation. I was joined by my wife, Jennifer, and our dear friends Belinda and Bill Aubuchon from Nokomis and I even got to sing in the choir!       In addition to all of the special events this week, I also met with many wonderful Floridians who were visiting Washington, D.C. I was proud to accept the Council on Residential Excellence (CORE) Award from the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches.   I also met with the Florida Chiropractic Association to discuss Medicare reform and other important issues facing their industry.&nbsp;   It was an honor hosting students from the Port Charlotte Simon Youth Academy during their visit to Washington!

President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address &#8212; an uplifting celebration of the diversity of the American experience and the triumph of the American spirit. The terrorist leader of al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula, who claimed to have orchestrated the NAS Pensacola shooting, has been eliminated.  Finally, and at long last, the sham impeachment trial has come to an end, and President Trump has been acquitted. Now that impeachment is finally over, will House Democrats get back to work for the American people? (The answer, unfortunately, seems to be&nbsp;&#8220;no.&#8221;)    TERRORIST KILLED On Sunday, Qasim al-Rimi, a cofounder of al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola in December.  On Thursday, February 6, the White House announced that Qasim al-Rimi was dead. On behalf of the thousands of patriots in Northwest Florida, I thank President Trump for his swift action in eliminating this brutal terrorist.&nbsp;  During his State of the Union address, the President stated that any assault on our freedom would be met with overwhelming, disproportionate retribution. He has kept his word. We are a safer, stronger nation tonight because of his leadership. &nbsp;  STATE OF THE UNION On the night of Tuesday, February 4, the President delivered his third State of the Union address. President Trump opened up his speech by declaring that &#8220;the state of our union is stronger than ever before.&#8221; He&#8217;s right. Wages are growing to new highs, the economy is soaring, and unemployment is at a 50-year low. Our nation has prospered greatly since President Trump took office, and his policies have led to success for ALL Americans.  The President&#8217;s remarks were uplifting and triumphant. It was a moving address, and well worth watching. Unfortunately, the conclusion of the speech was overshadowed by a political stunt from Speaker Pelosi.  &nbsp;  PELOSI&#8217;S DISGRACE At the conclusion of the President&#8217;s State of the Union address, while he received thunderous applause and a standing ovation, the Speaker took her copy of his prepared remarks and tore them in half. It is hard to overlook the symbolism of such a gesture &#8212; the sense that Speaker Pelosi was utterly dismissive of the President&#8217;s achievements and guests, and, more importantly, the achievements and success of the American people.  Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s gesture reflects poorly on her Speakership, and on the House of Representatives as a whole. The Speaker should not let her personal feelings about the President color her behavior as a leader in the United States Congress. This behavior is utterly unbecoming of the Speaker of the House.  I have sent a letter to the House Committee on Ethics, asking that they investigate the matter, and recommending that they censure the Speaker.  Tearing up this document was certainly distasteful &#8212; and was likely illegal, too. A section of federal law () states that &#8220;Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys [&#8230;] any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office [&#8230;] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.&#8221; Unlike the copies of the State of the Union address available elsewhere, Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s was an original, hand-signed copy. During State of the Union addresses, the President hand-delivers a copy of his remarks to the Speaker of the House, and to the President of the Senate (the Vice President). Those two copies are the &#8216;original&#8217; documents, from which all subsequent copies are made. They are not the &#8220;personal property&#8221; of the recipients. They are the property of Congress.  There is no question whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi &#8220;mutilated, obliterated, or destroyed&#8221; the copy of the President&#8217;s address provided to her at the beginning of the evening. The video evidence is clear and abundant; the Speaker herself gleefully acknowledged her actions. The Speaker cannot be above the law.  On Thursday night, I joined Laura Ingraham to discuss my letter to the Committee on Ethics. Watch it here:        Click to play!    &nbsp;  PRESIDENT ACQUITTED Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced an impeachment inquiry five months ago, but the &#8216;impeachment investigation&#8217; really began many months before that. For nearly a year, Democrats have been wasting Congress&#8217;s time, energy, and resources &#8212; with little to show for their efforts except heartburn.  If impeachment had not consumed Democrats&#8217; every waking moment, we could have had many bipartisan successes &#8212; from lowering prescription drug prices to rebuilding America&#8217;s infrastructure.  Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t been the case. My Republican colleagues and I have been preaching that this was a political stunt since the beginning &#8212; and on Wednesday, February 5, we were proved right, when the Senate concluded its impeachment trial and voted to acquit the President on both of the baseless charges levied against him. Of the 248 Republican members of the House and Senate, only one voted to convict the President. Mitt Romney chose pettiness and jealousy over objectivity.  We saw extreme moderates such as Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins vote to exonerate the President. This illustrates with clarity that this impeachment was purely political, and Romney&#8217;s vote was borne of bitterness, not principle. I am glad to put this national nightmare behind us, and hope that Congress will finally get back to working to help the American people.  &nbsp;  AROUND THE DISTRICT CHILDCARE FOR OUR HEROES The military families in our district sacrifice a great deal for America. But one sacrifice they should not have to make is childcare. Many military parents must drive to Eglin Air Force Base for childcare, which can add hours onto their daily commute.  Our military personnel protect our families, and we must return the favor. Not only does a lengthy and difficult commute hurt our military families, it also impacts our military readiness. The intense nature of the Special Forces Group demands the complete attention of participants, and when our operators are thinking about the strain on their families at home, they are not focused on their mission. This week, I wrote a letter with Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to urge to Secretary McCarthy to address the lack of childcare facilities for the 7th&nbsp;Special Forces Group. I look forward to hearing from the Secretary and lightening the burden for Northwest Florida&#8217;s warfighters. Read the letter here:    &nbsp;  JOSEPH AINSWORTH ACT Military veterans are the heartbeat of Northwest Florida.  Under current law, veterans whose net worth exceeds a certain threshold are ineligible for pension benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) calculates a veterans&#8217; net worth by evaluating the sum of the veterans&#8217; assets, plus their annual income. If that value exceeds the limitation the VA has set, the veteran is not eligible to receive pension benefits. This week, I introduced the Joseph Ainsworth Act along with fellow Florida representatives Ross Spano and Darren Soto. This bill would eliminate the &#8216;Net Worth Limitation&#8217; for veterans over 99 years of age &#8212; allowing centenarian veterans to qualify for full pension benefits from the VA, regardless of their net worth. Eliminating this rule for our military heroes who have achieved such a milestone in their life will help alleviate the financial burdens they and their families frequently endure. Furthermore, it also helps show our nation&#8217;s gratitude for these veterans&#8217; devotion to America. It is my hope that First Lieutenant Joseph Ainsworth&#8217;s situation will be eradicated for future centenarian military veterans, and that his service to our country will be immortalized through this legislation. A copy of the Joseph Ainsworth Act is available HERE.  &nbsp;  VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT The military is not a feature of our district &#8212; it is the defining characteristic.  Northwest Florida has been built by the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect America, and our cherished American values: freedom, justice, and the rule of law. It&#8217;s easy to walk down the street and forget how lucky we are to live amongst heroes.  Since the Library of Congress started the Veteran&#8217;s History Project in 200, over 6,000 Floridians have submitted their stories, but I know there are more out there. This week, we continued our efforts to uncover more of these stories. I look forward to hearing more about the lives of the men and women who have made our country great.

This year, we need to make progress on top priority issues for Americans like the opioid epidemic, criminal justice reform, and mental health care. As your representative, I will keep working to get things done for Marylanders. Here&#8217;s what I focused on last week:  Last Monday, I paid tribute to Holocaust Remembrance Day on the House floor and mourned the six million Jews that were murdered in this genocide. This year also marks 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. There alone, 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed. Holocaust Remembrance Day serves as reminder of what depravity humans are capable of when we don&#8217;t make it a priority to end intolerance. Today and every day, we must continue the fight against hatred.   Last Wednesday, I presided over the House floor during the debate on a bill that would temporarily ban fentanyl analogs. In 2018, synthetic substances like fentanyl were involved in approximately &#8532; of all opioid overdose deaths. We&#8217;re fighting to keep these dangerous drugs off of the streets. Later in the day, I was proud to help the House pass this bill. Now, I am calling on the President to sign it into law and keep vulnerable Americans safe.   The following day, the Maryland Legislature voted to override Governor Hogan&#8217;s veto of Delegate Nick Mosby&#8217;s &#8216;ban the box&#8217; legislation. The legislation would prevent employers from requiring an applicant to disclose whether they have a criminal record before their first in-person interview. All too often, returning citizens are passed up for jobs because of their backgrounds. Recent studies indicate that between 60 and 75 percent of the formerly incarcerated remain unemployed up to a year after their release. This just isn&#8217;t right. Banning the box in Maryland is a victory for our state and for the hardworking returning citizens that are building better lives for themselves and their families.       Rep. Trone visits Carmen&#8217;s Corner Store, a business in Hagerstown run by Mark Wilks, a returning citizen.&nbsp;    &nbsp;    EVENTS  On Tuesday, my office put on a Seniors Workshop in Hagerstown. I had a wonderful afternoon talking to constituents and hearing from experts about how to navigate some of the biggest issues our seniors are facing today, like skyrocketing prescription drug costs. I&#8217;ll keep fighting so that no Maryland is forced to empty their bank account to fulfill their basic needs. Thank you for a great and informative afternoon!

The President&#8217;s emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, and I&#8217;ve been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.   I am especially proud that President Trump announced his public support for my bicameral, bipartisan voluntary paid leave bill for hardworking families that does not increase taxes or create a new government program.This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy. This effort is yet another example of the critical, bipartisan work in Congress that I am proud to lead with the support of my colleagues.&nbsp; During his remarks, President Trump also surprised the family of Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams with his unexpected return from deployment in Afghanistan. Sergeant Williams is originally a native of Peru, New York. He is also a past Peru Fire Department Firefighter. I am proud that Sergeant Williams hails from the North Country, and it was incredible to witness him and his family reunite as they were honored for the sacrifices they have made in the name of our freedom. I thank Sergeant Williams for his service, and I am proud that President Trump reaffirmed his support for our military families. I was also proud to have David Fisher, dairy farmer from St. Lawrence County, accompany me to the State of the Union as my guest. David and the Fisher family have been operating Mapleview Dairy for four generations in Madrid, New York. David has been an active member of his community, serving on the Madrid Town Board for many years, and is currently also in his second term as President of the New York Farm Bureau. He has been an outspoken advocate for farmers in the North Country. He is well versed on agriculture issues and always makes sure that Upstate New York agriculture has a seat at the table, particularly on results like the USMCA. It was great to have him in the audience.

Throughout this unfair and unprecedented process, I proudly stood up for the Constitution, the facts of the case, and my constituents in New York&#8217;s 21st district. I applaud the Senate&#8217;s diligence in their trial and just acquittal of the President. I'm looking forward to getting back to work for the American people.&nbsp; Meeting with Constituents and Organizations Important to the North Country        It was great to meet with a variety of constituent groups and organizations important to my work on behalf of the North Country this week. I discussed the importance of rural broadband, funding for students with disabilities, and school safety with the New York State School Board Association. I met with the North Country Workforce Development Board leadership about increasing access to affordable child care, workforce development priorities, and helping dislocated workers and rehabilitated former non-violent offenders successfully reenter the workforce. I also met with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to discuss prison reform and funding for the drug free communities program. We also discussed the vaping epidemic facing our youth and the need for funding to go towards addiction prevention and education. It is always great to meet with constituents from the district and discuss the issues most important to them. Hearing directly from my constituents guides my work and priorities in Congress. Opposing New York State Law Causing Suspension of Global Entry, Trusted Traveler Programs for New York Residents  This week, in response to New York State&#8217;s &#8220;Green Light Law&#8221;, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced their decision to suspend enrollment in Global Entry and other trusted-traveler programs for New York State residents. The &#8220;Green Light Law&#8221;, which took effect in December 2019, allows issuance of a driver&#8217;s license to illegal immigrants. In making their decision, DHS cited that the state&#8217;s sanctuary policies that safeguard immigrants from deportation. DHS will immediately stop accepting new applications from New York State residents to enroll or re-enroll in some of the agency&#8217;s travel programs, including Global Entry. New York is the only state to be impacted by DHS&#8217;s decision thus far. After repeatedly ignoring law enforcement experts at the federal and local level, Governor Cuomo&#8217;s prioritization of illegal immigrants over law abiding New Yorkers is continuing to have damaging effects. The Governor&#8217;s reckless Green Light Law not only has hampered efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, it is continuing to have harmful implications for our state. In December of last year, I warned Governor Cuomo that this irresponsible policy would inhibit our CBP officers at the Northern Border from doing their jobs. Qualified, legal citizens should not be penalized by the Governor&#8217;s unconscionable actions, which not only hinder our border patrol, law enforcement, and other agencies from being able to effectively do their job, but now also prevent our residents from receiving access to important travel programs.

This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and helps meet the needs of communities by increasing funding and reauthorizes the program through the next five years. Over the past decade, the GLRI has assisted Great Lakes communities after decades of environmental damage threatened public health, regional economies, and drinking water. The GLRI has enabled the 8-state region along the Great Lakes to undertake one of the world&#8217;s largest freshwater ecosystem restoration projects. Assisting our communities in cleaning up their drinking water systems, restoring fish and wildlife habitats, and combating invasive species are critical examples of how this GLRI funding benefits North Country communities. This funding plays an essential role in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes and the ecosystems that surround them, and I am proud to continue to advocate in full support of its projects.

I am proud to be leading the effort in coordinating support between local and state elected officials, community groups, and local businesses in the area surrounding Fort Drum to advocate for the installation&#8217;s selection as the final site. I sent a letter to the Army advocating for Fort Drum's designation, and led many petitions, signed by hundreds of constituents with more signing on each day, in support of the stationing and activation of the additional headquarters at Fort Drum. My offices have worked closely with Advocate Drum to coordinate an outpouring of support from the North Country. Fort Drum is the best option for the activation and stationing of the Army&#8217;s fourth corps headquarters, and I am proud to be passionately advocating for this alongside my constituents. As the number one advocate for Fort Drum, I have worked tirelessly to lead the coordination efforts across the North Country, to build support for the Army&#8217;s consideration. I will continue to raise awareness that Fort Drum has unmatched capabilities and ready to rapidly expand to meet the criteria to support an Army corps headquarters. Read more here.

Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read:  Watertown Daily Times -&nbsp;President references Stefanik legislation in SOTU address  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said President Donald Trump delivered an &#8220;incredibly strong&#8221; State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he highlighted the Congresswoman&#8217;s legislation on paid leave and child tax credit.&#8220;The President&#8217;s emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country,&#8221; Ms. Stefanik said after the address, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.&#8221;&nbsp;During the address, Mr. Trump said he was proud to sign a law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave. And he called on Congress to pass the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, which he said would extend family leave to mothers and fathers across the nation.  &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful President Trump highlighted my bipartisan, bicameral legislation during his State of the Union address,&#8221; Ms. Stefanik said. &#8220;This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy.&#8221;&nbsp;Ms. Stefanik said the act would allow families the option to advance up to $5,000 of their recently-doubled child tax credit in the first year of a child&#8217;s life or the first year a family adopts a child. Most other paid leave proposals require parents to take off work to receive benefits, a release from Ms. Stefanik said. This bill allows teleworkers the option to access child care benefits and to continue working from home while they take care of their new child.   The bill does not raise taxes or take away from Social Security. It is the product of more than a year of work to craft a bill that could pass with bipartisan support, the release said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  _________________ Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:  Federal agencies.

Celebrating End of Impeachment!   &#8220;Today is the day to celebrate these great warriors who fought so hard for us&#8230; Jim Banks of Indiana&#8221; -President Donald Trump. I was honored to be one of 30 of my colleagues in the House and Senate selected to attend President Trump&#8217;s speech at the White House celebrating the end of impeachment. I&#8217;m so glad that we as a country can put this divisive episode behind us. And I hope impeachment is never again used as a partisan tool to smear the President. Click here to watch the full clip.   Honoring the Life of Officer Jason Dobbins   On Tuesday, I spoke on the House floor to honor the life of police officer Jason Dobbins. Dobbins joined the Warsaw Police Department in 2012 and, in total, served as a full-time law enforcement officer in northeast Indiana for 16 years. In the wake of his tragic passing last Saturday, Officer Dobbins is mourned by the Warsaw Police Department and by the whole of Warsaw, who remembers him as a great leader, father and friend. It is people like Jason Dobbins who embody the very best that our nation has to offer. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, son, three daughters and stepson in this sad time, and pray they may find peace. Click here to watch my floor speech.   State of the Union Special Guest: My Dad  I hope everyone was able to watch President Trump&#8217;s State of the Union address on Monday night. It was an optimistic speech that outlined the current blue collar boom happening in regions like northeast Indiana.  The president also honored our nation&#8217;s heroes including one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen from World War II, and Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, who was killed while serving his second tour of duty in Iraq by (deceased) Iranian terrorist Qassim Soleimani. The speech impressed me, both because of the long list of this administration&#8217;s accomplishments and because President Trump rose above the circus and petty politics that have mired Congress in recent months.  I was honored to have my dad, Ed Banks, as my special guest. We so deeply appreciate all this President has done to make this country great again.&nbsp;   Americans Deserve the Full Truth   Now that President Trump has been cleared, we need to make sure this never ever happens again to another American president. The best way to do that is initiate an investigation into the apparent corruption within the Democrat party. Democrats need to be held accountable for dragging our country through historic, unprecedented, partisan impeachment. Here&#8217;s what we know. We know Rep. Adam Schiff lied about his interactions with the whistleblower. We know the whistleblower went to Schiff&#8217;s committee before he wrote the complaint. We know the whistleblower worked for Joe Biden. That&#8217;s why the next step for Republicans is to investigate. We need to learn why the whistleblower came forward. We need to learn why Rep. Adam Schiff lied about his committee helping the whistleblower file a complaint. We also need to know how Hunter Biden landed the high-paying job in Ukraine and if Joe Biden altered American foreign policy in any way to benefit his son. Americans deserve the full truth so no future president has to go through the abuse this one has. Late last year, I sent a letter to Chairman Lindsay Graham, as reported by POLITICO, requesting the Senate Judiciary Committee investigate the origins of the impeachment inquiry and corruption within the Obama administration. Sen. Graham has since said that the Senate Intel Committee will call the whistleblower soon.   A Strong Week for President Trump   Bottom line: No president should ever have to go through what this president and his family has gone through. They&#8217;ve been dragged through the mud. We need to make sure this never happens again to another American president.  A lot of people ask me: Why would Democrats commit to continuing investigations after acquittal when Americans overwhelmingly want them to move on? The truth is they have little else to unite around except their dislike of our president.That's why they have no accomplishments. They refuse to work in a bipartisan way.  This has been the best week for President Trump since he was elected for a lot of reasons. He scored one victory after another, shaking up Democrat leadership and putting their entire party in a tailspin.&nbsp;Click here to watch my full interview with Bulls &amp; Bears.&nbsp;  UK-Huawei Partnership Puts US at Risk   Last week, the United Kingdom decided to allow the Chinese Communist Party help build its 5G network. The U.K. has not only put their own national security at risk, they've put any country -- including the U.S. -- that shares intelligence with them at risk as well.  That is why I introduced legislation that would prohibit the United States from sharing intelligence with countries that allow Huawei to operate their 5G networks. I am proud to have Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) join me as an original co-sponsor. The bill is the House companion version to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) on Jan. 8, 2020. This is like Margaret Thatcher, during Cold War, inviting the KGB to install the phone system for MI6. If that would have happened, Ronald Reagan would have cut the phone cord.

A critical first step toward re-balancing America&#8217;s trade with China,&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;made good on his promise to put &#8220;America First&#8221; by making sure American farmers, manufacturers and entrepreneurs are better protected from unethical and criminal behavior in the international trade system. With this first phase complete, I await eagerly the second and third phases whose negotiations must include other issues concerning China.\" Click here&nbsp;to read my full Op-Ed.    2020 Congressional Art Competition  I am happy to announce that my office is seeking high school students to participate in the 2020 Congressional Art Competition. It&#8217;s a really special experience for the young artists that participate. Students submit entries to my office, and a panel of judges select the winning entries.

I use this as a venue to tell the story of how the work I'm doing in Washington and in the district impacts you. Each week I will highlight important pieces of legislation I'm working on, show you how I'm engaging with constituents on the issues, and tell you about upcoming events in the district.&nbsp;This week I'm back in Washington working on important legislation to improve public access to water in the Valley. Here are some highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Fighting for water   &nbsp; Water is the lifeblood of our Valley. Farmers need water to feed the world and life becomes near impossible for residents who lack clean drinking water. I introduced a bill to provide funding for necessary repairs to the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct. These waterways are critical to supporting our Valley's water needs, yet they are decades old and showing their age. We need to invest in our water infrastructure now, for the future sustainability of our state.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Expanding healthcare access           &nbsp;  California is expected to face a massive shortfall of primary care doctors in the next 15 years, especially in rural and low-income communities.&nbsp;I recently introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act to increase our supply of doctors by providing funding for additional medical training in diverse and medically deprived communities, like the San Joaquin Valley. At this year's State of the Union, I invited one of our local dedicated Valley health professionals to be my guest:&nbsp;Enid Picart.&nbsp;A fourth year medical student at UCSF-Fresno, Enid has chosen to dedicate her career to improving healthcare for San Joaquin Valley residents. We need more passionate people like Enid, who know our communities, to stay and commit to our future. With an investment in them, we can ensure every Valley resident has access to the healthcare they deserve. &nbsp;        Rep. Costa with State of the Union guest Enid Picart.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Honoring a hometown hero           &nbsp;  I introduced a resolution to honor&nbsp;a&nbsp;pioneer in the Latino community and Fresno native, Tom Flores, and urge he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Coach Flores was recently passed over for&nbsp;the honor despite his noteworthy achievements in the sport. As the first Latino starting quarterback and&nbsp;head coach to win two Super Bowls with the Raiders, and&nbsp;first Latino head coach and&nbsp;general manager of the Seattle Seahawks and in professional football history, his accomplishments on the gridiron prove he is&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;deserving of this honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Improving Valley infrastructure  &nbsp;  I'm pleased to announce that Merced County is opening Phase II of Campus Parkway and breaking ground on Phase III. When completed, this vital infrastructure project will connect UC Merced to both Highway 140 and Highway 99, improving traffic circulation, and&nbsp;providing better&nbsp;access to health services and economic opportunity. Working together in a bipartisan effort is key to improving our Valley's infrastructure.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Supporting global women's health   &nbsp; As a strong supporter of reproductive rights throughout my career, I believe it is critical for the United States to fund programs that improve the lives of millions of women around the world. In a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, we discussed the Global Gag Rule and other policies of this Administration to restrict access to family planning tools. Many of these policies have undermined the United States' commitment to global public health and resulted in economic and physical harm to women around the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Pushing for responsible forest management  &nbsp;  One of my top priorities is to see our taxpayer dollars come back to the district. I'm pleased to report that the Fresno Regional Workforce and Development Board (FRWDB) secured an important CalFire grant to improve the health of our forests. Wildfires in California continue to have devastating impacts on our economy and air quality in the Valley. This new partnership will create 100 new skilled forestry jobs to help alleviate these effects. If we are to combat these growing threats, we need to bolster our efforts to responsibly manage our forests.&nbsp;   Other work on behalf of our Valley:&nbsp;  Voted to advance  that would provide funding to counter the damage Nutria are doing to our waterways in California.  about how legislation I helped introduce will&nbsp;&nbsp;for disadvantaged communities. The bill would also&nbsp;&nbsp;to increase storage and supply in our Valley.  to expand services and benefits to victims of Agent Orange exposure.  &nbsp;   Meeting of the Week:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's always a pleasure to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. This year at the United Nations Holocaust Observance, we had a productive discussion about building the relationship between the UN and our government in Washington, the UN's role in combating the climate crisis, and working to improve collaboration with our transatlantic partners. I will continue working with the UN and other nations around the world to promote global peace and prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upcoming Events Across the District:     &nbsp;  AARP Foundation Tax-Aide  &nbsp;  Free tax help for those with low- and moderate incomes, with special attention paid to those aged 60 and over.

A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Earlier this week President Trump delivered his annual State of the Union Address. I was pleased to bring as my guests Fifth District resident Starr Barbour, a health care advocate working to raise awareness&nbsp;about maternal&nbsp;and&nbsp;mental health disparities among minority communities in Maryland, and Vinny DeMarco, a longtime advocate for affordable health care in our state. I was pleased to highlight the important work Starr and Vinny are doing in our communities. Click here to watch a video we filmed right before going upstairs to watch the President deliver his speech.&nbsp;    I was extremely disappointed that the President used divisive rhetoric in his speech to distract from his continued attempts to reduce access to health care, make&nbsp;coverage less affordable, and take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, if President Trump was serious about lowering the cost of prescription drugs, he ought to support H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which would do exactly what the President campaigned on - allowing negotiation to lower costs. You can read an&nbsp;opinion piece by Vinny in the Baltimore Sun&nbsp;about why the President ought to support H.R. 3 here.&nbsp;  Read my full statement on the President's speech here.&nbsp;As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my&nbsp;office&nbsp;or connecting with me on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, or&nbsp;Instagram.  &nbsp;  Sincerely Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Steny H.

Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is.\" &#8211;Winston Churchill  I think the above quote may well describe the hope that many of us have for the state of politics in America and our ability to govern. Truth and common sense are under assault as the Socialist majority in the House of Representatives continues to mislead the American public in an attempt to gain full control of our government, and ultimately of our futures. There are so many issues on which Democrats are refusing to acknowledge the truth, but there are a few that have been particularly glaring within the first few weeks of this new year. False attacks against President Trump have been relentless, even to the point of condemning the killing of one of America&#8217;s most ruthless enemies. President Trump&#8217;s decision to give the order for our military to kill Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, should have been lauded by Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat colleagues as a fully justified strike to protect Americans and our allies. Both parties should have supported it and reinforced that it was a needed warning to other terrorists. But, bolstered by the left-wing media, prominent Democrat politicians staunchly refused to acknowledge that this was a good decision from President Trump, even seeming to openly side with Iran&#8217;s oppressive government&nbsp;and characterizing Soleimani as a reasonable and admired leader in Iran. The truth is that Soleimani was a ruthless despot&nbsp;responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including hundreds of Americans. While Democrats and leftist media condemned President Trump for his actions, freedom-seeking Iranians who suffered the cruelty and terror of Soleimani were celebrating in the streets.  What&#8217;s more, after a months-long miscarriage of justice in an effort to impeach President Trump, Speaker Pelosi sent articles of impeachment to the Senate, knowing full well that there was little chance of removal from office. The Senate has now voted to fully acquit President Trump. There was never evidence that the President committed an impeachable offense. President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine both repeatedly said that there was no connection between foreign aid and an investigation and that there was no pressure. Chairman Schiff lied repeatedly throughout the process and continues to lie, even&nbsp;about his lies. In my opinion and the opinion of many others, what Speaker Pelosi and her hand-picked co-conspirators did was a massive abuse of power that would have undermined future elections and would have led to a Constitutional crisis. Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues also continue trying to convince American families and workers that they are worse off now compared to before President Trump took office. The evidence points to the exact opposite. Indicator after indicator has shown how much better off people from all income levels are. Median household income is up, taxes are lower, regulations are less burdensome and costly, energy costs are down, and unemployment is at a record low. And, finally, the Democrats in the House still refuse to acknowledge the right to life for unborn children.&nbsp;For years pro-life men, women and children have peacefully gathered in Washington to speak up for the rights of unborn children. Every year that I have been a member of Congress, Congress has been in session during the week of the March for Life. But not this year. This year, Speaker Pelosi chose for the House to recess during the week of the March for Life. Democrats have also repeatedly refused even to vote on legislation that would protect children after they are born following an attempted abortion. This issue is perhaps where truth has been denied the most strenuously for decades, and we must continue to fight. I am very grateful for all the people from Alabama and from all across America who are courageously and compassionately standing up for the lives of unborn children. In sum, the events of the last several weeks have left me with deep concern&nbsp;for where our country&nbsp;is headed. They&#8217;ve revealed to me that there are Democrat members of Congress who genuinely believe President Trump was wrong to kill Soleimani, who believe the government should take away your right to make your own health care decisions, who want to destroy the ability of people to make a good living, and who are pro-death, even for babies that survive an abortion attempt. I pray that the American people will recognize that the future is in the balance, stand with us to get our nation back on the right track, and who will fight for the truth, even when it is denied and attacked.  Press Talks Washington Times: I'm thankful for the opportunity to contribute a piece to the Washington Times about Iran, the killing of Qasem Soleimani, and the actions that led to that decision. Read it here.  Alabama's Morning News with JT: Impeachment has now moved to the Senate, but the process is still riddled with falsehoods and injustice. I enjoyed talking with JT and giving the latest perspective and updates on the impeachment proceedings. The bottom line: the facts haven't changed! Listen here.  Talk 99.5 with Matt &amp; Aunie: It's always a good time when I can talk with Matt and Aunie. In this conversation, we discussed where the impeachment proceedings&nbsp;are headed from here, the 2020 elections coming up, and how past failings in foreign policies contributed to recent actions in Iran. Listen here.  The Jeff Poor Show: It was great to catch up with Jeff Poor about the situation in Iran and on where the impeachment trial stands in the Senate. Listen here.   In the District Constituent Highlight: Many congratulations to Sheriff John Samaniego for his recent appointment to the President's new Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice! Sheriff Samaniego has served Alabama's Sixth District with honor and I'm confident he will continue to do so in this prestigious new position. Read more here.  New I-59/I-20 Interstate Bridges: The new bridges for I-59 and I-20 have been officially completed and opened! I was glad to be able to speak at the opening and to be part of the ribbon cutting. This is an important milestone for Birmingham and I trust the new bridges will serve central business district well. The project began in 2015 and cost $700 million.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;          The NO Bill of the Month No War Against Iran Act(H.R. 5543, amendment to H.R. 550)  This legislation is in keeping with many Democrats' stringent denial of facts regarding Iran policy. It is one more part of their effort to paint President Trump's order to kill Soleimani as reckless and unfair. In reality, both Iranians and Americans are safer with Soleimani out of the picture, and this bill&nbsp;only adds&nbsp;needless restrictions. It would limit the accessibility of funds for using military force in Iran, and it tries to restrict the President's decision-making power when it comes to engaging in conflict with Iran. The War Powers Act of 1973 already put a check on the President's power when it comes to military force and declaring war. In short, this legislation tries to restrict the President's ability to defend the American people from a regime that consistently supports terrorism and provokes conflict in the Middle East. The only reason for this bill is the Democrats' disdain for anything President Trump does, even when he takes out a terrorist. It was very easy for me to vote no on this legislation.  Hearing Highlights In the continued obsession with finding something&nbsp;illegal to pin on President Trump, the Transportation and Infrastructure&nbsp;Committee held another hearing about the Trump Hotel lease and alleged violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. The hotel has been used as yet another weapon in the relentless attacks against the President instead of turning attention to the many pressing issues that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee could focus on. I made these concerns clear in my questions and also made the point that paying a market rate for a hotel room is not what the Founders had in mind when they put in place measures to limit foreign influence from emoluments. Watch here.    The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee recently held a hearing on water resources and related projects. I expressed my concern&nbsp;regarding a huge backlog of proposals on water infrastructure. I was grateful for the chance to discuss this with the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Watch my questions here.    Floor Action Floor Speech:&nbsp;Here are&nbsp;the remarks I made in opposition to impeachment just before Christmas. The concerns I expressed then still hold now, and I hope the Senate will summarily dismiss the articles.

Eight years ago, when I took my first oath of office in Congress, I swore to support and defend the US Constitution. I thought of that oath often as the House considered whether to impeach President Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;voted for impeachment&nbsp;because of the overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power by asking a foreign country to meddle in our election and then trying to cover up his wrongdoing by obstructing the House&#8217;s investigation. History will judge the Senate&#8217;s vote yesterday to acquit President Trump. As the House continues our work on behalf of the American people, we will build on the&nbsp;hundreds of bipartisan bills&nbsp;we have already passed&#8212;and&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;uphold our Constitutional duty&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a vigorous&nbsp;check on the Trump administration.     Join Me at a Town Hall Meeting in April Every year I hold town hall meetings around NW Oregon so I can hear firsthand from the people I&#8217;m honored to represent. My spring series of town hall meetings will include six events in April. Please join me! There will be additional details for&nbsp;each event on my website&nbsp;soon. All weekday events will be in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Vernonia &nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 6&nbsp;   Tigard &nbsp; Tuesday, April 7&nbsp;   Portland &nbsp; Saturday, April 11&nbsp;   Warrenton &nbsp; Monday, April 13&nbsp;   McMinnville &nbsp; Tuesday, April 14&nbsp;   Hillsboro &nbsp; Thursday, April 16&nbsp;       We All Need Health Care Access to&nbsp;health care is a human right, but far too often people in our community face communication, cultural, and financial barriers that prevent them from accessing care. That&#8217;s why I brought Serena Cruz, the Executive Director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation and an advocate for health care accessibility and immigrant rights,&nbsp;as&nbsp;my guest at the State of the Union address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center&nbsp;provides&nbsp;critical&nbsp;health care&nbsp;services&nbsp;and is named for a six-year-old daughter of migrant farm workers who died after a cut in her foot became infected. If she had been able to access health care, Virginia would have turned 51 years old&nbsp;last month. Today, Serena reports that the clinic is seeing pregnant women who are too afraid to seek the prenatal care they need because of the frequent attacks by&nbsp;President&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;and&nbsp;his administration on&nbsp;immigrants&nbsp;and&nbsp;people of color. We must stand up for all members of our community. In Congress, I am committed to stopping hateful policies and fighting for increased access to health care for all.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt Addressing the high cost of higher education is one of my priorities, and one of the reasons I entered public service. Students today face a very different reality than I did: I was able to work my way through community college, a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and a law degree with a manageable amount of debt. When I sent out a survey about student loans last fall, more than 700 people responded. They described their student debt as being stressful, burdensome, painful, and overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; To help these borrowers and others like them, I recently&nbsp;held a clinic on student loan debt&nbsp;with a national expert. There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to address crushing student debt, like making it easier for borrowers to access and stay in&nbsp;affordable&nbsp;repayment plans. The House Education &amp; Labor Committee included that provision and several others I drafted in the College Affordability Act. I hope the House will vote on this legislation soon to provide needed relief to students and borrowers.&nbsp;     At Home and at the Border,&nbsp; Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies Cause Harm I recently visited the Southern Border&nbsp;to investigate the Trump Administration&#8217;s Remain in Mexico policy, which has&nbsp;stranded tens of thousands of asylum-seekers&nbsp;in dirty and dangerous tent camps. In Matamoros, Mexico, I&nbsp;saw families and many children living in squalor, without running water or adequate food.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;no way to treat families&nbsp;who are coming to the United States to escape violence&nbsp;or persecution and who have the right to request asylum under international law.  When I returned home I met with nine asylum-seekers, including an unaccompanied child, who are participating in the legal asylum process. They told me about the dangers they fled and the hardship they have experienced here, all in the hope of making their case for asylum and building a better life in the United States of America.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too often this administration has attacked immigrants and fueled racism and xenophobia. In a roundtable discussion with&nbsp;a dozen local advocates, I heard about how fear and anxiety is clouding the lives of our immigrant neighbors, including&nbsp;Dreamers who have known no other home&nbsp;and now risk being deported. I&nbsp;stand with our immigrant neighbors&nbsp;and our friends, who are an integral part of our communities and&nbsp;must&nbsp;be treated with dignity.&nbsp;    In Case You Missed It  I helped improve the&nbsp;major new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada&nbsp;in the areas of labor, environment, access to medicines, and enforcement. After a protracted battle with the Administration, we secured an&nbsp;agreement that is better for Oregonians, workers, and the environment.&nbsp; My bipartisan&nbsp;Blue Carbon for the Planet Act&nbsp;will harness the powerful ability of&nbsp;healthy wetlands, tidal marshes, and seagrasses&nbsp;to&nbsp;sequester&nbsp;carbon for centuries or even millennia and mitigate the climate crisis.&nbsp; The House passed the&nbsp;bipartisan&nbsp;Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,&nbsp;which&nbsp;I co-led, to&nbsp;protect the&nbsp;civil rights of older workers&nbsp;in the workplace.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;helped advance&nbsp;legislation to&nbsp;make sure that&nbsp;pregnant workers&nbsp;have the accommodations they need&nbsp;to&nbsp;work and stay healthy&nbsp;during pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal funding will support the&nbsp;Portland Art Museum&#8217;s new Rothko Pavilion&nbsp;and the renovation of the&nbsp;Astoria Library.&nbsp; I was proud to lead a group of my colleagues in&nbsp;nominating Saudi women&#8217;s rights activist&nbsp;Loujain&nbsp;al&nbsp;Hathoul&nbsp;for the Nobel Peace&nbsp;Prize.&nbsp;             &nbsp;      &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp; Washington, DC 2231 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington,&nbsp;DC&nbsp;20515Phone: (202) 225-0855Fax: (202) 225-9497 Beaverton Office 12725 Southwest Millikan Way, Suite 220Beaverton, OR 97005Phone: (503) 469-6010Fax: (503) 469-6018 &nbsp;         &nbsp; &nbsp;   |               /***** SMARTPHONE STYLING RULES *****/ @media only screen and (max-width: 497px) { *[class*=\"container\"] { width:100% !important; table-layout:auto !important;} }  ","district":"1","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"OR","party":"Democrat","score":2.1911578},{"name":"Congressman Jeff Duncan ","address":"SC03JDIMA@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-05","subject":"Great American Comeback","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }   @media screen and (max-width: 497px) { a { text-decoration: none;} .mobile-menu {font-size:20pt !important;} .mobile-content {font-size:28pt !important;} .mobile-footer {font-size:8pt !important;} }        News from Representative Duncan                         Friends,  Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency is marked by 3 years of promise made and promises kept &#8211; and our nation is stronger because of it. The 2020 State of the Union Address was unifying, optimistic, and patriotic!&nbsp;  It&#8217;s truly amazing what he&#8217;s accomplished in 3 years &#8211; despite Democrats and the mainstream media trying to take him down. He&#8217;s blocked out the loud noise of the swamp &#8211; fairytales of Russian collusion and an unconstitutional impeachment &#8211; to get things done FOR YOU &#8211; the American people.  From record-breaking unemployment numbers, a booming economy, historic job creation, American energy dominance, deregulation, 21st century trade deals, standing up for the unborn, to a strong military, President Trump has made the American people&#8217;s priorities his own. Because of his leadership, our nation is experiencing a new era of prosperity.  The theme of President Trump&#8217;s State of the Union Address &#8220;The Great American Comeback&#8221; has reinvigorated the American spirit! I&#8217;m proud to stand with President Trump, the successes thus far, and the inspiring vision for the future to Keep America Great.&nbsp;  I was utterly disgusted by Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s actions last night &#8211; ripping up her copy of President Trump&#8217;s speech was nothing short of disgraceful. By ripping up the speech, Speaker Pelosi ripped up stories of Americans&#8217; dreams. She ripped up the recognition of a Tuskegee Airman recognized by the President, the reuniting of a soldier and his family, the dreams of a little girl in failing schools finally given a choice, the dreams of a young man wanting to join the Space Force, and the record-breaking jobs numbers.&nbsp;  Speaker Pelosi showed that these positive things for America mean less to her than the partisan quest to reclaim power so Democrats can run your lives from cradle to grave. Her actions show her true colors &#8211; thumbing her nose at millions of Americans who are better off today than they were before President Trump took office.&nbsp;  She may be able to rip up a speech, but she can&#8217;t rip up the accomplishments of this President.&nbsp;  America, I hope you noticed!&nbsp;  Read the entire State of the Union speech HERE.    &nbsp; Blessings and Liberty,  Jeff Duncan Member of Congress                             &nbsp; WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 2229 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-5301Fax: (202) 225-3216 ANDERSON OFFICE 303 West Beltline Blvd.Anderson, SC 29625Phone: (864) 224-7401Fax: (864) 225-7049 CLINTON OFFICE 100 Plaza Circle, Suite A1Clinton, SC 29325 Phone: (864) 681-1028 Fax: (864) 681-1030 &nbsp;        Unsubscribe | Privacy  Open in its own browser window&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Open a plain text version      ","district":"2","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"TN","party":"Republican","score":3.455167},{"name":"Rep.

We fought to keep jobs in America by ensuring labor standards are enforced on our trade partners. We negotiated the removal of provisions that would have protected pharmaceutical companies at the expense of American patients.&nbsp;No less importantly, because of our efforts, environmental protections were significantly strengthened in the final deal. Once these changes were agreed upon,&nbsp;I was more comfortable voting to ratify the USMCA on December 19, 2019. The treaty passed the House by a vote of 385-41.&nbsp; Many adjustments were made to the deal since it was first presented to the House of Representatives. After tough negotiations, House Democrats were able to make the following changes for the American people:     Original USMCA Draft USMCA Updates Made by the House   Difficult to File Labor Violation Claims: The original draft set intentional procedural barriers that would make it harder for workers to prove labor violations affected trade and investment. The final version automatically assumes that labor violations affect trade and investment and will require the other governments to prove otherwise.&nbsp;   Weak Labor Monitoring: The original draft omitted resources and guidelines that would bolster the ability of the US to monitor strengthened labor provision enforcement in Mexico and Canada.&nbsp; The final USMCA deal provides the US with significant enforcement mechanisms, including:&nbsp;   Ongoing reporting requirements to Congress.   Labor attach&#233;s that will be based in Mexico to provide detailed regular information about Mexico&#8217;s labor practices.   Clearly defined benchmarks for Mexico&#8217;s labor reform implementation process. Any failure to comply with these benchmarks will lead to enforcement action under the agreement.   An interagency committee that will monitor Mexico&#8217;s labor reform implementation and compliance with labor obligations.     Difficult to File Environmental Violation Claims: The original draft set intentional procedural barriers that would make it harder for workers to prove environmental violations affected trade and investment. The final version automatically assumes that environmental violations affect trade and investment and will require the other government to prove otherwise.&nbsp;   Weak Environment Monitoring: The original draft omitted resources and guidelines that would bolster the ability of the US to ensure that Mexico and Canada were enforcing their environmental commitments.  The final USMCA deal provides the US with significant enforcement mechanisms, including:   Environment-focused attach&#233;s in Mexico City that will regularly monitor Mexico&#8217;s environment laws, regulations, and practices.   An interagency committee that will assess the current environmental landscape of Canada and Mexico and monitor their implementation of the environment obligations. This agency will also help the U.S. to coordinate and implement efforts to strengthen environment practices.     The original draft guaranteed 10 years of market exclusivity for biologic drugs, which would bar drug companies from manufacturing generic alternatives. This provision had the potential to drive up drug prices in Mexico and Canada, where shorter market exclusivity periods exist, and stand in the way of American efforts to lower drugs prices.  The final USMCA deal provides the US with significant wins geared towards lowering the price of prescription drugs, including:   Removal of the 10 year market exclusivity threshold. Revisions that make it easier for generic drug companies to obtain marketing approval on day one of a current drug&#8217;s patent expiration. Revisions that permit incentives for generic drug competition and improves transparency.

Tonight, President Trump spoke about a Great American comeback. But too many who wrestle with soaring drug prices, crumbling infrastructure and an uncertain economic future still feel like they are falling further behind. The state of our health care is anything but strong. This Administration put Americans&#8217; health security on the chopping block by threatening those with pre-existing conditions and failing for the past three years to fulfill promises to lower prescription drug prices. Americans need more than just assurances. They demand action. The State of the Union should be a unique opportunity to unite Americans. Tonight&#8217;s address missed the mark.&nbsp;I continue to stand ready to work with the President on bipartisan priorities like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, rebuilding our infrastructure, investing in broadband and expanding career and technical education. Real progress will require a genuine effort at partnership.    Congresswoman Bustos with her guest Cindy Ramos and American Diabetes Association&#8217;s CEO Tracey Brown.  I&#8217;d like to thank Cindy Ramos for being my guest to this year&#8217;s speech and for bravely sharing her story. Ms. Ramos is an advocate for the American Diabetes Association who has experienced first-hand the challenges of rising drug prices after struggling to afford her insulin. That&#8217;s why I was honored she joined me to bring awareness to this critical issue. Last year, I was proud to help pass the Lower Drug Costs Now Act to help people like Cindy, who struggle with rising prescription drug prices.

He outlined the Great American Comeback story that he and his Administration have led. During the speech, he laid out an optimistic vision about how we can continue this progress and build a better future for all. Continuing reading to see my full statement on the State of the Union speech. Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump on the partisan articles of impeachment sent to them by House Democrats. Congress has been tied up for months with the House Democrats impeachment obsession. Partisan politics need to be put aside. It&#8217;s long past time to put this impeachment charade behind us and get back to work for the American people.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   State of the Union President Trump continues to put America first and advance the interests of our nation. The strong economy under this administration is lifting Americans everywhere. This administration successfully negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which created 176,000 new jobs, added $68 billion in new economic growth and was a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses. He also delivered on a historic &#8220;Phase One&#8221; trade agreement with China. I was happy to hear the President speak on the jobs created in the opportunity zones established in the Republican tax cut bill. In Georgia, 260 opportunity zones have attracted investments &#8211; including in Muscogee County &#8211; and brought new economic opportunities to our local community. This administration has made tremendous progress in fixing our broken immigration system and securing our border. I was pleased to hear the President&#8217;s plans to continue building a safe and legal immigration system by facing head-on the public safety threat posed by sanctuary cities. The President&#8217;s remarks on issues facing working families, from ensuring that every child can get a great education, to supporting America&#8217;s parents as they manage the demands of their careers while raising children were also commendable. While the Democrats continue to embrace socialist healthcare policies, the President thoughtfully laid out his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs while maintaining the highest standard of care and access to the most innovative cures. President Trump has kept his promises and America is strong once again. As he made clear in his remarks, there are many opportunities for Congress to help Americans and keep our nation moving forward. I remain committed to working with President Trump, his administration and my colleagues in Congress to continue to grow our 21st century economy and create an environment that ensures opportunity for all.  &nbsp;   Mobile Office Hours Members of my staff will be in Fayetteville and Hamilton on Wednesday, February 12th to meet with constituents and assist anyone experiencing a problem with a federal agency.   &nbsp;  Telephone Town Hall I'm excited to announce I will be hosting my next&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;town&nbsp;hall on February 11th starting at 6:30PM.

Last night, President Trump gave a misleading picture. The reality is that Trump&#8217;s policies are immoral and they hurt women and children in our communities while enriching himself and his friends.  As I escorted President Trump to the House Chamber, I was representing our For the People Agenda, a bold contrast to President Trump, reminding everyone that this country is for them &#8211; no matter where they come from, what their background, or who they love. As President Trump expands his Muslim ban and his officials announce that they will target DREAMers, I am proud that my colleagues and I passed the American Dream and Promise Act and I will fight for us to pass the No BAN Act to put an end to this and future discriminatory travel bans. As a Vice Chair of the Equality Caucus, I am advocating against the attacks on our LGBTQ community and am using my new position on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold this Administration accountable. President Trump touts a growing economy, but his policies are failing hard-working American families while enriching himself and his friends.&nbsp;And under Attorney General Barr, the Department of Justice is fighting in court to repeal the ACA, taking away healthcare from thousands of New Mexicans.&nbsp;President Trump has even announced he plans to cut Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp;  Families in New Mexico and across the country know that this Administration's policies are working for the wealthy and well-connected, while hurting hardworking families. Almost 50,000 New Mexicans in our district rely on SNAP to feed their families, but are now threatened by rule changes that will take food away from hundreds of thousands of people across the country. As someone who had to rely on SNAP at times to keep food on the table, I know how important these programs are to our community. I will work with my colleagues to fight on behalf of every day New Mexicans, not just the wealthy.  While President Trump claims to make us safer, he has disarmed us in our fight against climate change, which remains our greatest national security threat. I am proud to have voted for and passed the Climate Action Now Act, a bill aligning us the Paris Climate Accords and restoring our position leading the world in this fight. The House of Representatives also passed the Scientific Integrity Act to ensure all decisions made by the federal government follow sound science instead of the whims of lobbyists. As the Vice Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, I will continue to hold up New Mexico&#8217;s commitment to a renewable energy revolution as an example for the rest of the country.  The President tried to claim credit for improving our national security, but instead he nearly dragged us into an unnecessary war and stole money from vital projects for his misguided border wall. New Mexicans have a proud history of heeding the call to service and deserve leadership that works for them, not uses them as props. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was able to get housing protections for our military families, which will help all of our serving families living on Kirtland Air Force Base, as well as provisions to start the PFAS cleanup on Kirtland.  Lastly, my membership on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the U.S. puts me in a position to hold the federal government to its trust responsibility to provide for healthcare, public safety, housing, and infrastructure programs. As part of this effort, I will continue to be a tireless advocate for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women so we can give a voice to this silent crisis and enact concrete solutions to address it. We do have things to be proud of over this past year, there have been victories and improvements for every day Americans due to the House of Representatives. I believe our best days are ahead of us and we don't have to accept President Trump's policies that enrich the wealthy instead of our future.

He intends to vote guilty on Article I and not guilty on Article II. His remarks can be viewed below and the full text of his remarks is as follows:   The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic&#8217;s success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of Congress for these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other&#8217;s good faith.  The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a Senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise &#8220;impartial justice.&#8221; I am a profoundly religious person. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the President, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.  The House Managers presented evidence supporting their case; the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the President&#8217;s team presented three defenses: first, that there can be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that the Bidens&#8217; conduct justified the President&#8217;s actions; and third that the judgement of the President&#8217;s actions should be left to the voters. Let me first address each of those defenses.  The historic meaning of the words &#8220;high crimes and misdemeanors,&#8221; the writings of the Founders and my own reasoned judgement convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove a president defies reason.  The President&#8217;s counsel noted that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian Prosecutor General. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.  With regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father&#8217;s name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the President&#8217;s counsel that a crime had been committed, the President&#8217;s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There is no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the President would never have done what he did.  The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution&#8217;s requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the Founders&#8217; decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to voters was intended to minimize&#8212;to the extent possible&#8212;the partisan sentiments of the public.  This verdict is ours to render. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfilled our duty. The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a &#8220;high crime and misdemeanor.&#8221;  Yes, he did.  The President asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival.  The President withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so.  The President delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders.  The President&#8217;s purpose was personal and political.  Accordingly, the President is guilty of an appalling abuse of the public trust.  What he did was not &#8220;perfect&#8221;&#8212; No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security interests, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one&#8217;s oath of office that I can imagine.  In the last several weeks, I have received numerous calls and texts. Many demand that, in their words, &#8220;I stand with the team.&#8221; I can assure you that that thought has been very much on my mind. I support a great deal of what the President has done. I have voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and biases aside. Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented, and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history&#8217;s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.  I am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced. I am sure to hear abuse from the President and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?  I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he said might raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.  Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I am convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We have come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.  I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the President from office. The results of this Senate Court will in fact be appealed to a higher court: the judgement of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the President&#8217;s lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me. I will only be one name among many, no more or less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the President did was wrong, grievously wrong.  We&#8217;re all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that is distinction enough for any citizen.       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Unsubscribe         ","title":"Senator, 1st Class","gender":"M","state":"UT","party":"Republican","score":2.2265844},{"name":"Senator Martha McSally","address":"Newsletter@mcsally.senate.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-04","subject":"Senator McSally's Week in Review","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                   WEBSITE |    SUBSCRIBE TO E-NEWSLETTER          February 4, 2020    Working for Arizona  McSally, Kaine Introduce Bill to Provide Veterans with Innovative Mental Health Treatment Options McSally Seeks Greater Protections for Arizona Seniors Hounded by Scam Calls McSally Stresses Need to Improve Security after Tucsonan Killed in Kenya Terrorist Attack  In the News  Arizona business, political leaders praise signing of USMCA trade agreement Arizona politicians, business leaders cheer trade deal signing McSally, Collins seek Social Security protections for seniors Bill introduced to expand mental health treatment options for veterans Sen.

That&#8217;s why I urged the Trump administration to temporarily suspend all flights coming into the U.S. from China, the epicenter of the virus.  Take a look at the article below and let me know if you agree.  Vern   Vern Buchanan: White House Needs to Suspend All Flights From China Due to Coronavirus Kevin Derby  At the end of last week, pointing to the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., called for suspending all flights from China to the U.S.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) designated coronavirus as a global health emergency, Buchanan urged the White House to suspend flights from China.  &#8220;We should be taking all reasonable precautions,&#8221; Buchanan said. &#8220;Temporarily restricting travelers from China is a reasonable response to this growing threat.&#8221;  Buchanan&#8217;s office insisted the White House has the power to suspend flights.  &#8220;Under current law, the secretary of the Department of Transportation may suspend air travel to and from a foreign country if&nbsp; &#8216;a condition exists that threatens the safety or security of passengers, aircraft, or crew&#8217; and that the suspension is in the public interest. In 2018, the U.S. suspended air travel to and from Venezuela due to unrest and violence,&#8221; Buchanan&#8217;s office noted.  The Southwest Florida Republican also noted British Airways has already suspended some flights to and from China. Buchanan also doubled down on his calls for the federal government to declare a public health emergency in order for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to have access to more federal funds.           &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

I have been hard at work and wanted to update you on my work, both in Washington, DC and back home in Houston.  During the December and January District Work Periods, I was in Washington fulfilling my constitutional duty as part of the ongoing impeachment process against President Donald&nbsp;Trump. In December, we held&nbsp;numerous hearings in the House Judiciary Committee leading up to the impeachment of the President for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.   On January 15th, I was named one of the seven impeachment managers tasked with presenting the people&#8217;s case for removing the President from office before the U.S. Senate and the American people.  Despite having to spend more time in DC because of impeachment, my team and I have participated in many events across the Texas 29th Congressional District, including: Co-Sponsoring a Townhall Action Meeting on Cancer Clusters with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,&nbsp;participating in&nbsp;various School Board Appreciation Month Celebrations, and attending a community breakfast hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). To learn more about my work, be sure to follow me @RepSylviaGarcia on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  Now You Know: The 2020 Census  April 1st is Census Day 2020!    By April 1st, every home should have received an invitation to participate in the 2020 Census, and it will be celebrated with events across the country. When completing the census, you will have three options for responding: online, by phone or by mail. Be sure to include everyone living in your home!&nbsp;  The U.S. Census Bureau is recruiting to fill hundreds of thousands of temporary positions across the country to assist with the 2020 Census count.

Legislative Update:  House Democrats and I have been hard at work on behalf of the people of America. Below you can read my legislative update on work taking place on the Judiciary Committee and Financial Services Committees, the two committees that I have the honor of serving on.  Major&nbsp;updates from the House Judiciary Committee:  H.R. 5645: Eyes on the Courts Act of 2020 On January 16th, 2019, Chairman Nadler along with other bipartisan members reintroduced the &#8220;Eyes on the Courts Act.&#8220; This legislation will require cameras be permitted in the Supreme Court and all federal appellate courts. This legislation would provide transparency and allow Americans to have access to court proceedings.  Remain In Mexico Policy Investigation On January 14th, 2019, the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, including myself, launched an investigation into how the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; immigration policy has morphed into a policy where refugees and asylum seekers are being kept in Mexico indefinitely without due process or access to counsel. This investigation will help to ensure the health and safety of asylum seekers at the border.  Major&nbsp;updates from the Financial Services Committee:  H.R. 4302: Homeless Assistance Act of 2019 This bill would allow public housing agencies to share data with local governments and nonprofit service providers, which will help them better identify people who experience homelessness and who need to use multiple services. I supported this bill because I believe it is critical that our social service providers are able to effectively connect residents with resources&nbsp;  H.R. 5315: Expanding Opportunities for MDIs Act This bill would strengthen a U.S. Department of Treasury program to encourage collaboration between Minority Depository Institutions (MDI&#8217;s) and large financial institutions. I am a proud supporter of this bill, as I strongly believe in supporting American small business, especially those that are women and minority-owned.  H.R. 2398: Veteran HOUSE Act of 2020 This bill would expand the eligibility for the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program to veterans experiencing homelessness who have received an other-than-honorable (but not dishonorable) discharge. Supporting our veterans is important to me, and the passage of this bill is one step closer to providing supportive case management and access to resources for those who need it most.&nbsp;  Other major bills in the House of Representatives:  H.R.&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; Lower Drug Costs Now Act This bill would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug manufacturers for lower prices. Insulin is one of the first drugs the secretary must negotiate, and the lower prices will be available to Medicare beneficiaries and those with private insurance. This is an issue that is particularly close to my heart, since seven of my nine&nbsp;siblings are diabetic. This a critical step forward in the fight for affordable healthcare, and it is especially important here in our district where 30% of our district is uninsured according to the US Census Bureau. War Powers Resolution On January 9, 2020, the House of Representatives voted to approve a resolution aimed at restraining the President's ability to use military action against Iran without congressional approval. The resolution states that &#8220; the United States military force, American people and members of the United States Armed Forces deserve a credible explanation regarding the use of military force.&#8221;  Notable News:        Texas Tribune: Garcia got to Congress, and landed in&nbsp;this impeachment role, through quiet competence, resilience amid the rough and tumble nature of Harris County politics&nbsp;and an ability to develop key relationships with friends and rivals alike, according to interviews with over a dozen Texas Democrats.      In District Event Highlights:    Houston Chronicle:&nbsp;Consumer advocate Erin Brockovich to speak on cancer cluster in Fifth Ward at town hall. The town hall, hosted by Jackson Lee and U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Houston), will focus on relief for the community affected by the contamination. Federal, state, county and city representatives, as well as legal experts and environmental and health advocates, are expected to attend. Union Pacific said in a statement that the company will also have a representative present. Concluding Message:  Thank you for taking the time to keep up with the work I&#8217;m doing on your behalf.

Major General Churn earned this&nbsp;medal&nbsp;more than five years ago but&nbsp;ran into trouble having it awarded&nbsp;after moving on to his next assignment. That&#8217;s when he reached out to my office, and with the help of my staff, we were able to jump through the right bureaucratic hoops and make sure that Major General Churn received his well-earned&nbsp;award.&nbsp;You can watch the ceremony in the video below:&nbsp;    As Senator, my first priority is serving folks across the Commonwealth, especially our men and women in uniform, as well as veterans who have proudly served our country. Oftentimes, that means cutting through the red tape or intervening on their behalf when they need assistance.&nbsp;  If you or a veteran or service member you know needs help with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 540-857-2676 or using&nbsp;this form  I couldn&#8217;t agree more with the advice Major General Churn offers in that video to his fellow veterans and service members: you&#8217;ve earned your benefits and honors through service to our country, so reach out to your representatives if you&#8217;re experiencing a problem with the military or VA bureaucracy.

The theme of Black History Month 2020 is \"African Americans and the Vote.\" This February, I encourage all Marylanders to take time to remember the brave men and women who led the Civil Rights Movement and fought so tirelessly for the cause of voting rights. Click here to watch my video message on Black History Month.&nbsp;         This month, I will continue to call on the Senate to take up H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which I was proud to bring to the House Floor late last year. This critical legislation will restore voting protections struck down by the Supreme Court in the misguided&nbsp;Shelby County v. Holder decision. I look forward to working with my House Democratic colleagues to advance equality and opportunity for all Americans.  As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my&nbsp;office&nbsp;or connecting with me on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, or&nbsp;Instagram.  &nbsp;  Sincerely Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Steny H.

I hope you enjoyed the big game yesterday. It was an exciting game (and, as a Seahawks fan, I was happy to see the Niners lose). My favorite parts? The Groundhog Day commercial... and the food! I ate far too many chips, far too much dip, and way too many chicken wings. Actually, it was a pretty fun game (and my daughters have convinced me to become a fan of The Masked Singer). Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be heading back to DC, and the first order of business is the State of the Union address. I was asked by someone after my town hall this Saturday what I hoped to hear from President Trump on Tuesday night. There are a lot of differences between the resident&#8217;s priorities and mine. Having said that, most of the folks I represent want the President to work with Democrats and Republicans to solve some problems. In his address, I hope the President outlines some areas where he believes he can work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people. In fact, this morning, I joined a number of my colleagues in asking that President Trump address areas where the American people want folks in D.C. to find common ground and make progress, including:   Improving access to quality, affordable health care. Unfortunately, the Administration has taken steps that have increased premiums and increased the number of uninsured Americans. There are opportunities to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and fix elements of our healthcare system that need fixing. That should be a priority that both parties can get behind.&nbsp; Following through on a commitment to rebuild America&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure. It&#8217;s hard for America to compete in a 21st Century economy with 19th Century infrastructure. There aren&#8217;t Democratic roads or Republican bridges, so this ought to be an area where the two parties and collaborate. Prioritizing a future that works for all Americans. In the midst of disruptive economic change, it&#8217;s important to ensure that American workers are empowered to navigate those changes rather than be victimized by them. Investments in education and training, efforts to increase wages, and strengthening protections for workers can ensure that more people in more places have economic opportunity. Restoring America&#8217;s role in the world. It&#8217;s time to reengage constructively with our allies and restore our role as a leader. That can improve America&#8217;s security and economy.&nbsp; Taking action to build long-lasting solutions to reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy sector will be a core driver of economic growth and job creation. There are a number of common-sense, bipartisan proposals that would represent concrete action to curb carb emissions, spur economic growth and create jobs.  I feel so strongly about the need to make progress on that last priority, I&#8217;m bringing a special guest to the State of the Union: Kitsap County resident Mike Kelly. Mike, a small businessowner who lives with his family on Bainbridge Island, is the Congressional District Liaison in our region for Citizens&#8217; Climate Lobby, a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on policies to combat climate change. I&#8217;ve been working actively to see the United States take action to step up to the climate crisis. Thankfully, I&#8217;m not alone. In fact, folks across our region and across the country are stepping up to raise awareness about the need to act. Mike Kelly, local organizers, and the team at Citizens Climate Lobby are helping to lead the way. I&#8217;m proud to have Mike attend the State of the Union to continue the call for the President to listen to the American people who are not just demanding action - but leadership - to combat climate change and its impacts. We know that if we do this right, we can not only help our planet - we can create quality jobs and sustainable economic growth. You can read all about what Mike&#8217;s attendance means to him in the Kitsap Sun.  There are plenty of policy differences between me and this Administration, but in an era of divided government, progress requires collaboration. I hope we hear that commitment to working together from him tomorrow, too. Now, on to the news&#8230; Taking Action to Keep America Safe  In recent weeks, there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion about rising tensions between the United States and Iran. As I&#8217;ve traveled across our region, I&#8217;ve heard from folks who are deeply concerned about this escalation - and I share those concerns. Ultimately, the American people do not want - and Congress has not authorized - another war in the Middle East. Our servicemembers and diplomats who serve there, including the ones I visited in Iraq this past November, deserve a strategy that keeps them safe, enhances our security, and fosters long term stability in the region.  Last week, Congress passed two bills I co-sponsored to reclaim the Constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and authorize the use of military force, an authority that has eroded over the last two decades. You can hear more about that here:    Ensuring Future Generations Never Forget  Every year on Holocaust Memorial Day, we honor the millions of innocent people who lost their lives. Families across the world have their own stories of this dark chapter in our world&#8217;s history.  This year on Holocaust Memorial Day, which coincided this year with the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the House passed the &#8220;Never Again Education Act&#8221; - bipartisan legislation I supported to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America so future generations can continue to learn these stories. This bill will provide fundamental resources, education, and training for teachers and students across the country to ensure we continue to educate our communities and future generations on the lessons of the Holocaust - and ultimately promote the importance of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people.  Continuing the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic  Across our country, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have been one of the leading causes of drug overdoses and fatalities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 41% of the 70,200 drug overdoses in the United States in 2017 were caused by fentanyl and illicit chemical copycats of the drug, which is 100 times more potent than morphine. And in 2018, there were over 30,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths alone. In response, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2018 placed a temporary emergency order to classify all fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 drugs (meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use). This temporary order increased restrictions in terms of access, manufacturing, and use - and has led to the supply of new fentanyl analogues dropping by 75 percent.  Last week, the House took bipartisan action to extend the temporary order on these drugs for 15 more months, overwhelmingly passing the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report within 12 months on the public health and safety effects of controlling fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1. While its only a temporary solution, it&#8217;s a start. I&#8217;m hopeful that Congress will continue to work to develop common-sense, long-term solutions to the opioid crisis.&nbsp;  Working for You  Honoring Our Veterans  Want to be inspired?!? Listen to this story... I recently held a Vietnam Veterans pinning ceremony in Tacoma to say thank you to Vietnam-era vets on behalf of a grateful nation. About halfway through the event, we got a call that a group of veterans was on its way from the Retsil Veterans&#8217; Home in Kitsap County but that they would be an hour late. Having already pinned everyone in attendance, I made an announcement that more vets were on the way, and I asked if folks would be willing to stick around to thank the folks who were coming from Retsil. I was so moved that every single person stuck around. One veteran said to me, &#8220;You know, a lot of us have waited forty or fifty years to get thanked. I can wait a few minutes to honor these folks coming from Retsil.&#8221;&nbsp;  WOW! It was a real testament to the awesome character of our community - and of the veterans who have served our country. I&#8217;m grateful for everyone that came out for this special event.   Celebrating Team Kitsap  The economic forecast for Kitsap County is bright thanks to the presence of the incredible employers, innovative educational partners, and the economic development A-Team that is the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance. It was great to join them to talk about opportunities for the future. Count me as a proud member of Team Kitsap!    Supporting Washington&#8217;s Ocean Economy  I&#8217;m committed to supporting Washington&#8217;s ocean economy. I enjoyed the opportunity to be in Grays Harbor to hear from members of the fishing community and discuss a new bill I introduced to improve the federal fishery disaster process and ensure more timely disaster relief for impacted communities. I&#8217;m also working as a member of the Appropriations Committee to restore our salmon populations.    Helping Our Seniors  Seniors today are facing unique challenges. That&#8217;s why I was grateful for the opportunity to hold a seniors town hall at the Willows Retirement Living in Bremerton to hear from folks and to talk about the work I&#8217;m doing to ensure Congress protects Medicare &amp; Social Security, lowers the cost of prescription drug prices, and keeps our nation&#8217;s promise to take care of older Americans.    Hearing from You at Town Halls  Speaking of town halls... I held a town hall in Suquamish on Saturday where we talked about opportunities to reduce student debt and ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.&nbsp;  Couldn&#8217;t come? Join me February 10th at 5:30pm PT for a Facebook Live Town Hall. It&#8217;s always important for me to be available, accessible, and accountable to you.  OK - that&#8217;s it for now folks. As always, I&#8217;m honored to represent you.

This year is a big one. As you may know, the US Census Bureau will attempt to count every person in the United States in 2020. The results of this census are crucial to the future of California and its 33rd District. Please watch this video to see why it&#8217;s so important to be counted in the 2020 Census:&nbsp;             Your participation in the Census is critical to our community because an accurate population count helps ensure the federal government is providing adequate funding and support to localities like ours. In mid-March, households will begin receiving instructions on how to participate in the census. When the invitation arrives, you can respond in one of three ways: online, by phone, or by mail. For more information on the California census, visit .  In addition to making sure everyone gets counted, here&#8217;s an update on what I&#8217;ve been working on recently: Advocating for middle class families  In December, I voted in support of the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act of 2019, which would curb the harmful SALT deduction cap. The GOP tax law gave massive benefits to the top 1% while average middle-class families footed the bill.  Breaking ground on new bridge        &nbsp;    Earlier this month, I joined Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, CalTrans District Director John Bulinski and LA County Public Works Director Mark Pestrella in a ground-breaking ceremony for a new bridge on Mulholland Highway over Triunfo Creek. The original bridge was one of three damaged or destroyed by the November 2018 Woolsey Fire. The Woolsey Fire had a devastating impact on our community but it&#8217;s clear that, when it comes to the ongoing recovery efforts, coordination is key in helping our community rebuild.  Supporting lower drug costs  I was proud to vote in support of the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. This bill would give Medicare the power to negotiate directly with drug companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. No American should go broke trying to afford lifesaving medication.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Championing city and state diplomacy        &nbsp;    During a markup in the House Foreign Affairs Committee I expressed support for my bill, the City and State Diplomacy Act. If passed, this bill would provide federal support for mayors and governors who engage with their foreign counterparts around the world to fight climate change, support U.S. trade investment, increase global health and more.

Statehood Bill    Congresswoman Norton, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, and House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) announced at a press conference on January 30th that Norton&#8217;s bill to make D.C. the 51st state, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act (H.R. 51), will be voted on in the Committee at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, February 11.&nbsp; This vote will be the first congressional vote on the D.C. statehood bill since Norton got the first-ever House floor vote in 1993.&nbsp; Once passed by the Committee, H.R. 51 will be ready for a vote on the House floor.&nbsp; Passing bills on the House floor requires 218 votes.&nbsp; Norton&#8217;s bill has 224 cosponsors.  Norton says she is particularly grateful to Chairwoman Maloney for her support, particularly in granting Norton&#8217;s request that the Committee vote occur on February 11, the week of the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Lincoln freed D.C.'s slaves before issuing the Emancipation Proclamation for all other slaves in the United States.&nbsp; Frederick Douglass was a longtime D.C. resident who fought tirelessly for full and equal rights for D.C. residents.  Read Norton&#8217;s full remarks here.    Norton Joins Oversight Subcommittee on Environment    Congresswoman Norton announced that she has joined the House Committee on Oversight and Reform&#8217;s Subcommittee on the Environment.&nbsp; Norton, the second most-senior Democrat on the Committee, now sits on three Oversight subcommittees: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Government Operations, and Environment.&nbsp; In Norton&#8217;s new role, she will help focus the Subcommittee on numerous public health and environmental concerns, including climate change, environmental protection, public lands, endangered species, air and water quality, conservation, energy policy, research and development, and the regulatory affairs of these issues.  &#8220;Combatting climate change has long been one of my top priorities in Congress,&#8221; Norton said.&nbsp; &#8220;I hope to bring my experience as the former head of a federal agency to hold this administration accountable for their failure to protect public health and the environment for future generations.&#8221;    Norton Introduces Bill to Establish National Effort to Promote Healthy Lifestyles through Nutrition and Exercise    Congresswoman Norton introduced the Promoting Healthier Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise (LIFE) Act of 2020, which would encourage exercise and healthy eating habits nationwide.&nbsp; Norton&#8217;s bill would provide $25 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to combat obesity and sedentary lifestyles in three ways: conducting national education campaigns about how to recognize and address overweight and obesity; training health professionals to recognize the signs of obesity early and to educate people concerning healthy lifestyles; and developing intervention strategies to be used in everyday life, such as in the workplace and in community settings.&nbsp; This initial funding would be only for pilot efforts to develop best practices and give the country a coherent national strategy for combating overweight and obesity.  Reducing overweight and obesity rates has been a priority for Norton in Congress.&nbsp; Although her LIFE Act is a national bill, she notes that the District of Columbia has higher rates than many jurisdictions of conditions related to obesity, such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.&nbsp; Adult obesity rates in the United States have more than doubled since 1980, from 15 percent to 35 percent.  Read Norton&#8217;s full statement here.    Norton Hosts Quarterly Meeting with National Park Service    Congresswoman Norton held a community meeting with the National Park Service (NPS) and D.C. residents at the Cleveland Park Library on January 30th.&nbsp; Norton&#8217;s quarterly meetings are an ongoing series for District of Columbia residents and NPS.&nbsp; Norton&nbsp;announced last May&nbsp;that she had gotten NPS to commit to regular public meetings with D.C. residents to hear directly from the community regarding NPS parks, which constitute almost all of the District&#8217;s parks, in their neighborhoods.  &#8220;NPS is one of my priorities because almost all parkland in the District of Columbia is owned by NPS and funded by the federal government,&#8221; Norton said.&nbsp; &#8220;Our regular meetings throughout the city have been popular with D.C. residents in ensuring NPS carries out its important local responsibilities, including frequent communication with residents and transparency with them on conditions in our local parks.&nbsp; We are pleased that our parks and their upkeep are funded by their owner, NPS.&nbsp; Although NPS is not a local agency, when it comes to our neighborhood parks, that is exactly how they must perform.&nbsp; I am grateful that NPS has agreed to hear from the community on a regular basis to prioritize their needs and concerns.&#8221;    Thanks for subscribing!

Gun violence plagues our communities and in Congress we are working hard to pass legislation to make our communities safer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    LEGISLATIVE HIGHLIGHTS: Tuesday, January 28, 2020  Joint Subcommittee&nbsp;on Energy and the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change Hearing on Out of Control: The Impact of Wildfires on our Power Sector and the Environment   The recent wildfires in California and Australia are a stark reminder of the climate crisis facing our nation, and of the impacts that this crisis is already having on our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. In Brooklyn, more intense heat-waves and storms due to climate change are a serious threat to our local power grid, triggering blackouts in many recent years. In the face of this challenge it is imperative that we take steps to protect our communities and make our power sector smarter and more resilient.  Wednesday, January 29, 2020  Subcommittee&nbsp;on Communications and Technology Hearing on Empowering and Connecting Communities through Digital Equity and Internet Adoption   The American people deserve access to broadband devices, the internet and affordable services. Congressman McNerney, Lujan and I recently introduced H.R. 4486, the Digital Equity Act to ensure every person is provided access to the digital literacy they deserve in 2020 and beyond. Information is power and someone&#8217;s income level or neighborhood should have zero impact on their access to broadband internet.  Friday, January 31, 2020&nbsp;  America&#8217;s Bigot-in-Chief has struck again&#8212;this time limiting the rights and banning immigration from certain African countries. President Trump&#8217;s announcement of an African Ban further perpetuates his racist, xenophoic agenda to whitewash America. See tweet here.    IN THE DISTRICT:  &nbsp;  Small businesses are one of the many pillars that make New York&#8217;s 9th Congressional District so unique.

See tweet&nbsp;here.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH:    As we enter into Black History Month, I reflect on the life and legacy of Shirley Chisholm who has had a great impact on my own life. See tweet&nbsp;here.    &#8234;Shirley Chisholm first ran for Congress in 1968, and won, going on to serve seven terms as a US Representative.&#8236; As the 1st Black woman to be elected to a Congressional seat, she fiercely advocated for social justice and minority education opportunities. See post here.&nbsp;    Unbought and unbossed (her famous catch phrase), Shirley Chisholm leaves behind a rich legacy, and inspires me every day to work tirelessly as an advocate for our community. Today, and every day, we celebrate the queen, Shirley Chisholm. See tweet&nbsp;here.    Spike Lee is a staple of Brooklyn&#8217;s pop culture, and an icon known across the country. One of my favorite Spike Lee joints, Do the Right Thing, debuted in 1989 and is an incredible portrait of Brooklyn&nbsp;and the values important to our borough.

Approving this deal ensures manufacturers, service providers, agricultural communities, and energy producers in North Dakota and across the country are able to operate on an equal playing field with some of our biggest trading partners and puts them in a better position to fulfill their missions. I thank President Trump and my colleagues in Congress for their tireless work to make this deal a reality.   Official White House Photo by D. Myles Cullen  I visited with&nbsp;The Daily Caller&nbsp;about why President Trump was uniquely prepared to deliver the USMCA and other trade victories for the American people.    _____________________________________________________________  Introducing the \"Unborn Child Support Act\"  Life begins at conception. Our laws should reflect that truth, especially when it comes to helping mothers provide for the welfare of their children, which is why I introduced the &#8220;Unborn Child Support Act.\" This bill give mothers the ability to receive child support payments while they are pregnant. If we are going to be pro-life, we should be pro-all-of-life and ensure we give moms the support they need.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unborn Child Support Act allows a court, in consultation with the mother, to award child support payments while the child is still in the womb and retroactively up to the point of conception as determined by a physician. Montana Senator Steve Daines, Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn and Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe joined the bill as original cosponsors.  _____________________________________________________________&nbsp;  Impeachment Update  During the second week of impeachment, we heard the conclusion of the President&#8217;s opening statement, asked questions&nbsp;of both teams, and voted to move to the conclusion of the trial. I joined Dana Bash on CNN prior to the Senate voting on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents. Throughout this entire trial, Democrats have failed to make the case for impeaching President Trump, and no witness would change that. We will vote on the articles of impeachment this coming Wednesday and finally put this behind us.    _____________________________________________________________  Senate VA Committee Passes HBOT and Tribal Affairs Legislation  During a committee markup this week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs (VA) passed the &#8220;Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019.&#8221; This bill contains several provisions to improve mental health services for veterans, including an expansion of the VA&#8217;s research into Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT).&nbsp;I&#8217;ve witnessed firsthand the powerful difference Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy can make for our veterans. Our legislation is a positive step. It advances the study of this treatment, which ought to create a pathway for more veterans to receive access to this care. If passed by the Senate, this legislation would authorize the Secretary of the VA to enter into public-private partnerships to research the effectiveness of HBOT, require the VA to use an objective test to measure the effectiveness of HBOT treatment, and commission a comprehensive review and study of HBOT, both within the VA and in outside organizations.&nbsp;During the same hearing, the Senate VA Committee also advanced bipartisan legislation to establish a Department of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Tribal and Indian Affairs. This committee would exist to provide guidance and information on issues and concerns specific to Native American Veterans. The victory of getting this language &#8211; creating a Tribal and Indian Affairs Advisory Committee for the VA &#8211; was very special.&nbsp;In North Dakota, our Native Americans have the highest rate of military service of any ethnic group, and I think that&#8217;s true throughout our country. They&#8217;re some of the most patriotic people I know. This Committee would provide an opportunity for them to have even greater input into the issues and the policies of the VA, as well as giving them access to the leaders.  _____________________________________________________________&nbsp;  \"Never Again Act\" Passes the House  Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal and I were pleased to see the passage of the House counterpart to our bipartisan, the \"Never Again Education Act,\" which would establish dedicated federal funding to provide teachers with resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust.  I'm grateful to the House of Representatives for recognizing the importance of educating the next generation about this terrible moment in history. Learning the lessons of the Holocaust helps ensure a tragedy such as this is never repeated.&nbsp;  _____________________________________________________________  Hashing It Out&nbsp;  I sat down with Siraj Hashmi of the Washington Examiner to discuss trade, anti-Semitism and the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump. Watch our full interview below.    _____________________________________________________________  President Trump Proposes Middle East Peace Plan  President Trump offered a bold vision for a brighter future for Israel and the Palestinian people in his Middle East peace plan. Through his strong and effective leadership, the President has made significant progress toward bringing peace and prosperity to the region and our ally Israel. I hope world leaders are able to build on this momentum, and I urge each side to take their seat at the table to continue making important progress.  _____________________________________________________________  Contact Me  My offices are open in Bismarck, Grand Forks, Minot, Fargo and Washington, D.C.

Further, I was pleased to honor Botetourt County on the House Floor as they are set to celebrate their 250th anniversary. It was a productive week in Washington, but I am pleased to be spending the weekend back in the Sixth District with those I represent.&nbsp;  Danger Pay for U.S. Marshals:   The U.S. Marshals Service often works alongside their DEA and FBI counterparts on dangerous missions abroad. From working to combat transnational criminal organizations to interrupting human trafficking rings, the brave men and women of the U.S. Marshals Service put their lives on the line to ensure the safety and security of American citizens. Yet under the current statute, Marshals do not qualify for danger pay in certain countries as do employees of other federal law enforcement agencies. To remedy this inequity, I along with Lou Corea (D-CA, introduced the bipartisan Danger Pay for U.S. Marshals Act. I am proud to have sponsored this bipartisan legislation which ensures, without requiring additional funding, that our Marshals are compensated fairly and earn the pay they rightly deserve while protecting Americans from violent criminals.&nbsp;         Signing USMCA: After more than a year waiting in limbo, the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) was signed this week by President Trump. USMCA is a big win for the American people, creating a more level playing field for workers, strengthening agricultural trade, and modernizing intellectual property protections.&nbsp;This agreement has the potential to create nearly 600,000 jobs and generate up to $235 billion in economic activity. USMCA opens new markets for our manufacturers and farmers, which will allow them to thrive. American agricultural exports are expected to increase by $2.2 billion under USMCA -&nbsp;with annual dairy exports predicted to rise by nearly $315 million. Further, the agreement is&nbsp;expected to create up to 76,000 new auto jobs, spur $34 billion in new investment in the auto industry, and add $23 billion in auto parts purchases each year. I am excited to have been a part of passing this historic agreement, and look forward to seeing the prosperity it is bound to bring to our country.&nbsp;  The President continues to keep his promise to the American people that he will fight for fairer trade deals for our nation. Not only did the President recently sign the Phase One Trade Deal in which China pledged to increase American imports by $200 billion over the next two years, but he also signed profitable deals with Japan and Taiwan.         Fentanyl &amp; the Opioid Epidemic:  The opioid epidemic does not discriminate based on age, sex, race, or socioeconomic status. It is a plague that affects Americans in all regions of the country, including Virginia&#8217;s Sixth District. In 2016, the United States experienced an astonishing 60,000 deaths related to drug overdose, nearly two thirds of which involved opioids. That means that more than 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose each day, making it the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50. This crisis is being fueled in-part by a synthetic opioid known as fentanyl &#8211; a drug 80 to 100 times more powerful than morphine. In 2018 alone, more than 800 people died from fentanyl overdoses in Virginia.  I applaud my colleagues for voting to save lives this week by renewing the classification of fentanyl as a Schedule I narcotic. Through commonsense solutions like this and support for first responders and treatment programs, I am confident we can help our fellow Americans struggling with opioid abuse and end this insidious epidemic.&nbsp; Fentanyl kills. The small dose pictured below is enough to be fatal.         Botetourt County's 250th Anniversary:  I took to the House Floor this week to recognize the 250th anniversary of Botetourt County.&nbsp; Not only is our region filled with beautiful landscapes, but it is rich in history and culture. Whether it is to experience the countless outdoor recreation opportunities or to immerse themselves in an area with ties to great Americans like Thomas Jefferson and Lewis and Clark, visitors come from far and wide to experience the place where I and thousands of others are fortunate enough to live. May God continue to bless Botetourt County on its next 250 years.&nbsp;         Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman.

It was great being back in the 11th District last week, where I traveled throughout communities and heard directly from folks at home about what we should be tackling in Congress. Hearing directly from my constituents about the issues facing the community helps me get it right in Washington.  This week, I had the opportunity to visit and walk through our local Lancaster county Home Depot. I appreciate Kyle teaching me about their paint department. Keep up the great work, Kyle!   Here is a fun video of my visit&#8230;  Click Here    During the district week, I had the opportunity to present Elizabeth Silbaugh Johnides, a constituent from Hanover, PA, with a copy of the Congressional Record which included my remarks about her outstanding service to the community in Hanover. To see my speak about her accomplishments on the House floor, click here.  I also had the opportunity to visit the Guthrie Memorial Library in Hanover with the new Mayor of Hanover SueAnn Whitman. At the library, I read a book to children about the importance of voting.&nbsp;   I toured the Elsner Engineering Works, a manufacturer of machines and equipment in Hanover, PA.   I finished the week at the PA Career Link Facility in York County to discuss the work they are doing to help veterans and individuals reenter the workforce.   Here is a video of my week in the district...  Click Here    The USMCA Is Signed Into Law!  On Wednesday, President Trump delivered on his promise to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA) and signed into law the much-awaited United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement.&nbsp;  &nbsp;The USMCA delivers on the promise President Trump made to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This deal marks a tremendous victory for Pennsylvania workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses. It has the potential to create nearly 600,000 jobs and generate up to $235 billion in economic activity.&#8221;   In Pennsylvania, trade with Canada and Mexico is essential. Over 42,000 jobs depend upon manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico. The USMCA will provide businesses across the Commonwealth with new opportunities and will create new jobs with family-sustaining wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The signing of the USMCA into law means expanding and opening new market access for our Pennsylvania dairy, egg and poultry producers. New markets are welcome news for the nearly 7,000 family-owned and operated farms in PA-11. Our farmers in York and Lancaster Counties, who are national leaders in the production of milk and eggs, have only asked for a level playing field which to compete.   This modern trade deal brings our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico into the 21st century, protecting American intellectual property and ensuring strong, effective protections for innovators and creators. I congratulate the President for delivering on his promise, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to implement policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our nation.   The President and Vice President gave outstanding remarks at the signing of the bill, for those who may have not been able to watch, here is a link to watch the full bill signing.&nbsp;  Click Here     March For Life  On Friday, thousands of people from across America came to our nation&#8217;s capital to March for Life. I applaud President Trump for making history as becoming the first sitting president to attend the march. In his remarks, he reaffirmed his commitment to implementing pro-life and pro-family policies. Since 2017, the Trump Administration has established more conscience protections than ever before. While progress has been made, there is still more to accomplish.&nbsp;  It is always heartening to see so many young adults, families, and college groups come to peacefully demonstrate for the rights of the unborn. The fight to protect life from conception is one that involves all of us.&nbsp; Click below to hear my remarks on the House floor about March For Life and also videos from the rally!&nbsp;  Click Here    Click Here    Click Here    WDAC Weekly Radio Appearance  Click Here     #NeverAgain  January 28th, 2020 marked the 75th year since the liberation of over 7,000 prisoners from the German Nazi Auschwitz camp. For nearly five years, these resilient individuals, including 700 children, saw their loved-ones murdered while they endured humiliation, suffering, and pain. &nbsp;I cosponsored and voted in favor of the bipartisan Never Again Education Act (H.R. 943), which authorizes funding to be used to develop and nationally disseminate resources to promote understanding about how and why the Holocaust happened. The education materials will be developed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.   For more information on the Never Again Education Act click here.

Click Here     Democrats&#8217; Dangerous Attempt To Repeal The AUMF  This week I voted against the House Democrats&#8217; dangerous attempts to tie the hands of the Commander &#8211; in &#8211; Chief by repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).&nbsp;At a time when Congress should be&nbsp;projecting unity in the face of Iranian aggression, House Democrats&nbsp;have advanced a dangerous resolution that ultimately will accomplish nothing but division.&nbsp;By&nbsp;taking legal and necessary options off the table for the executive branch, this&nbsp;amendment&nbsp;emboldens our enemies and&nbsp;makes&nbsp;our nation less safe.&nbsp;The safety and security of the American people at home and abroad should be the central focus of our foreign policy. I strongly oppose this legislation. We must keep Americans safe.&nbsp;To read my full statement on this legislation, click here.   York County District Attorney&#8217;s Visits Washington  It was great to have York County District Attorney, Dave Sunday, in the office this week. He was in town for the National District Attorney Association 2020 Capital Conference. We discussed important criminal justice issues facing York County.&nbsp;I appreciate his office&#8217;s efforts to keep our community safe and look forward to continuing our discussion.     Honoring Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick  This week, Congress honored the life and service of Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick who lost his battle with cancer. He was a fierce advocate for Pennsylvania&#8217;s 8th district and he will be missed.  Click to Watch     Here&#8217;s Lloyd  Since I&#8217;ve taken office, I&#8217;ve held nearly 300 meetings with constituents and nearly 200 visits all across our district&nbsp;including&nbsp;schools, non-profit organizations and small businesses.

On January 8, the House passed H.R. 5065, the Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated Act, a bill I co-led and introduced with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. This bill&nbsp;would provide small business counseling and training services to non-violent offenders. Some individuals who have paid their debt to society deserve a second chance at success, and this will prepare them to re-enter society and contribute to the workforce. The Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated Act follows another bill I co-led, the Patriotic Employer Protection Act, which passed the House in November, and later became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act that the President signed into law in December. This legislation strengthens programs that enable employers to hire military reservists, and both bills speak to the effectiveness of bipartisan efforts that have the power to improve lives and strengthen our communities.  I&#8217;m committed to local investment and growth, which is why I co-sponsored H. Res. 815, Supporting Minor League Baseball. As you may have heard, Major League Baseball recently decided to eliminate 42 minor league clubs across the nation. This decision would affect six of Tennessee&#8217;s minor league teams. We&#8217;re fortunate to have the Tennessee Smokies nearby, and it would be a shame for towns from the East to West Coast to lose the local investment that minor league baseball provides.  At the end of last month, I was proud to introduce H.R. 5634, which would amend the Social Security Act so folks who are owed past-due Social Security benefits are paid first instead of their legal representatives. Since taking office, many of you have contacted me about your frustration with late Social Security payments, and I hope that this measure will enable those who have contacted me, as well as all Americans across the country who have worked their entire lives for Social Security benefits, to receive them in a timely manner.  As January closed, I joined my colleagues in remembering the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp by paying tribute to the survivors and victims of the Holocaust. I was honored to attend a Europe, Eurasia, Energy and the Environment Subcommittee meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee where I heard Dr. Deborah E. Lipstadt, professor of Jewish history and Holocaust studies at Emory University, speak. My dad fought the Nazis in World War II, and I am extremely concerned at the recent rise in anti-Semitism. I will continue to support initiatives like this one that fight anti-Semitism and honor the victims of the Holocaust. I&#8217;m hosting a Town Hall meeting on Thursday, Feb. 20 from 6 to 7 p.m. at Jefferson City Hall, 112 City Center Drive. During the meeting, constituents will be able to ask questions and learn more about my legislative agenda.

I felt no joy on that day, but the burden of anticipation and a palpable sense of history. As the trial begins, each of us will takes a new oath &#8220;to do impartial justice&#8221;. Simple words, profound responsibility.   Scenes from Maine    Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s passion and eloquence lit a new path forward for our nation by reminding us of its promise to all; in doing so, he inspired generations of Americans to work towards that goal. His legacy lives on through each of us who choose to serve our communities and fight for equality.   On Martin Luther King Day, I spent the morning at the&nbsp;University of Maine with hundreds of Maine people who came together to celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s legacy.    Maine has vast ocean resources, a commitment to sustainability, and an innovative workforce &#150; all the tools we need to build a &#8220;blue economy&#8221;! I'm grateful for the work of New England Ocean Cluster to create jobs that support our economy and environment, and it was an honor to visit them earlier this month. &nbsp;   I stopped by the The Bangor Region YMCA earlier this month. The Bangor Y is a longtime pillar of the community, working to help young people address behavioral and mental health challenges, including substance use disorders.&nbsp;   Naturalization ceremonies are powerful examples of our nation&#8217;s principles: people who have worked to access the American dream swearing an oath to the Constitution.

Trump, effectively condoning the President&#8217;s crimes and the railroading of our Constitution. They did this in spite of disturbing new information that came to light last week from John Bolton, who wrote that&nbsp;the President ordered the shakedown of Ukraine two months before the&nbsp;July phone call with Ukraine's President Zelensky&nbsp;and&nbsp;the vast majority of Americans saying the Senate trial &#8220;should allow witnesses with firsthand knowledge to the impeachment charges to testify.&#8221;  Meanwhile, the Trump Administration continues with its ceaseless assault on women's rights and failure to respond to human suffering in the United States and around the world. That is why I am sharing&nbsp;this edition of Jackie's Reading Picks with you, a collection of articles, essays,&nbsp;and editorials that piqued my interest over the past week and that provide valuable insight and context for what is happening&nbsp;and what we can do to ensure that our core principles and values as Americans remain steadfast.&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;you will find them as informative, instructive, and, in some cases, as&nbsp;inspiring as I did.  Thank you for reading and all my best,&nbsp;&nbsp;                         As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

A Dishonorable Senate By The Editorial Board, The New York Times The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.      &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;       The vote also brings the nation face to face with the reality that the Senate has become nothing more than an arena for the most base and brutal &#8212; and stupid &#8212; power politics. Faced with credible evidence that a president was abusing his powers, it would not muster the institutional self-respect to even investigate. The week began with such promise, or at least with the possibility the Senate might not abdicate its constitutional duty. Leaks from John Bolton&#8217;s forthcoming book about his time in the White House appeared to confirm the core of the impeachment case against Mr. Trump: his extortion of Ukraine by explicitly conditioning hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid on the announcement of investigations into his political rival. For a moment, it seemed that enough Senate Republicans would come to their senses, listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans, and demand to hear testimony under oath from Mr. Bolton and maybe even other key witnesses to Mr. Trump&#8217;s Ukraine scheme.

Others should follow suit.      &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;      By The Editorial Board, The Washington Post THERE&#8217;S STILL no obvious right way for  Facebook announced this week that it would remove some posts, photographs and videos pushing misinformation about the epidemic. Some of these are conspiratorial, suggesting that the virus is part of a Chinese plot to build a bioweapon with stolen samples from a Canadian lab, or that U.S. government officials secretly patented a vaccine against the illness. Others related to treatment or prevention are more obviously dangerous: Vitamin C, for example, can&#8217;t guard against or cure coronavirus, and neither can oregano oil, cannabis, air purifiers or &#8212; scariest of all &#8212; bleach. It&#8217;s these particularly harmful nuggets of deception flagged by leading health authorities that Facebook is vowing to scrub from its platform, in a break with its preferred practice of merely reducing the distribution of offending content. It&#8217;s the right move amid an ongoing global crisis: Researchers have pointed to the damage done by widespread lies surrounding the Zika and Ebola viruses. The choice is also in keeping with the thinking that guides major technology companies as they moderate content: the higher the likelihood of real-world harm, the harsher the response. So while anti-vaccine screeds in general may get demoted and misleading advertisements banned, tall tales about a real-time public emergency are deleted entirely.

New media outlet covering the intersection of women and politics launches as 2020 election kicks off By Sarah Ellison, The Washington Post  Then came the election of President Trump, the Women&#8217;s March, the start of the #MeToo movement. &#8220;It seems like there was a niche nonprofit newsroom for almost everything, and I wondered to myself why no one had created one at the intersection of women and politics,&#8221; Ramshaw said. She kept seeing a need. She continued in her role as editor in chief of the Texas Tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. In March last year, she sat down with Amanda Zamora, the Tribune&#8217;s chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit ProPublica, and presented her idea.AD &#8220;You could tell she was completely taken with this idea of a site that looked at the impact of politics and policy on women,&#8221; Zamora said. &#8220;Once she is set on something, you have no doubt that she&#8217;s going to make it happen, and I knew it was something I wanted to participate in.&#8221; To read the complete article, click here.            Her Uighur Parents Were Model Chinese Citizens. It Didn&#8217;t Matter. When Zulhumar Isaac&#8217;s parents disappeared amid a wave of detentions of ethnic minorities, she had to play a perilous game with the state to get them back. By Sarah A. Topol, The New York Times Magazine  Humar&#8217;s grandmother lived in a farming town that had once been outside Hami city, but as the city stretched out, subsuming the countryside, town and city merged. Over her grandmother&#8217;s lifetime, the Chinese state encouraged wave upon wave of migration of the ethnic Han majority to Xinjiang, which means &#8220;new frontier&#8221; in Mandarin, partly to dilute the Uighur presence while also cementing Communist Party rule in the natural-resource-rich region. By 1996, when Humar was 8, the proportion of Han in Xinjiang had risen to about 40 percent, up from 6.7 percent at the founding of the Communist Chinese state in 1949 &#8212; one of the largest demographic changes in China&#8217;s modern era. As a child, Humar was precocious and stubborn &#8212; &#8220;big headed,&#8221; the clan collectively called her. At the time, most Uighurs attended school in their own Turkic language, with Mandarin taught as a foreign language. As family lore has it, Humar herself demanded to attend a Mandarin school, so she could watch more channels on TV. Her parents, perhaps thinking more about their daughters&#8217; future, endorsed the decision, enrolling Humar and her younger sister, Zumret. Before Humar&#8217;s first day of class, her parents sat her down to explain that she would be one of only a few Uighur students in her school. She would have to be especially careful about what she ate: There would be pork, which they, as mostly secular Muslims but Muslims nonetheless, could not eat. &#8220;Watch out,&#8221; h  er parents cautioned. &#8220;Pay attention to everything you put in your mouth.&#8221; Humar and Zumret would be the first in their extended family to attempt this integration, and their parents the first to navigate what it meant for their traditions.

Inhofe, US Senator for Oklahoma * INHOFE INFORMANT: Fighting for Life * * * In case you missed it, hundreds of pro-life Oklahomans joined tens of thousands of Americans to march for life last week. I was proud to stand with these marchers not only last week, but this week and every week. Read my entire op-ed on why we must continue to fight for life in the Oklahoman here [link 1] and below. [image = Inhofe in the Oklahoman: The war on the unborn: We must keep fighting* * If you watch the liberal news media today, you would think no one is advocating for the unborn or standing up for the right to life. Thank goodness the media has it wrong. Support in the United States for the pro-life position is strong. A recent Gallup poll showed 50% of Americans consider abortion morally wrong. For the first time since 2013, more Americans are pro-life (49%), rather than pro-abortion (46%). Other polling has found that the majority of Americans don't support taxpayer-funded abortion. By highlighting the value of all human life, we're making progress to end the abortion on demand culture. But the fight isn't nearly over. Liberal states are continuing to push for more and more extreme abortion laws. New York and Vermont have enacted laws that will allow abortion up to the moment of birth. Illinois passed a law making abortion a \"fundamental right\" and explicitly stating that unborn children do not have rights. It's heinous. The abortion-on-demand industry has no respect for the dignity of human life. Last year, authorities discovered more than 2,000 aborted fetal remains in the home of a deceased abortion doctor from Indiana. The evidence is clear: We must fight every day so abortion doesn't claim any more unborn babies. When you are pro-life, you believe every life is a gift from God that begins at conception -- no matter what. That means you believe in the value and future potential of every child. Sadly, not everyone sees that. Case in point: Over two-thirds of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted in the United States. I introduced legislation to prohibit abortion based on a Down syndrome diagnosis. I also have cosponsored several key pro-life bills, including the Life at Conception Act, which recognizes that life begins at conception, and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization. On top of efforts in Congress, we have the most pro-life president in history. We have worked together to guarantee that federal tax dollars can't go toward abortion by protecting the Hyde Amendment and reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy. We have also stripped abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, of using federal Title X funding for abortions. And we're not done. Just this month, I joined more than 200 of my colleagues in urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade. This would be a huge win for life. But, as we see with New York, Vermont and other states, when we make progress in Washington by standing for life, liberal states try to roll back those protections. That's why the work of Oklahomans for Life and events like Rose Day at the state Capitol are so important. Oklahoma is also consistently ranked as one of the top ten states most protective of life. This week alone, hundreds of pro-life Oklahomans will join tens of thousands of Americans who are marching for life. I'm proud to stand with these marchers this week and every week. We know that as we keep fighting for what is right, we will not be overcome. Rather, we will overcome evil with good by upholding and affirming the dignity and inherent worth of every human being. We will keep fighting. *Inhofe, R-Tulsa, is Oklahoma's senior U.S. senator.* I was glad to have so many of the Oklahomans marching for life stop by my office so we could talk about our shared values. *View some of the photos from their visit below:* [image = [image = [image = [image = ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] Office Locations: Washington, DC Office: 205 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 -3603 Main: (202) 224-4721 Fax: (202) 228-0380 Tulsa, OK Office: 1924 S.

Time to Modernize in ESA   The Endangered Species Act was signed into law 47 years ago with the worthy goal of protecting and revitalizing endangered and threatened animals and wildlife.

On Wednesday, President Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. Our businesses (both small and large), workers, and economy will all benefit from this trade deal. Estimates say it will add $68 billion to our economy and create over 170,000 new American jobs. In Ohio alone, over 100,000 jobs depend on exports to Mexico and Canada. Make no mistake, this is big; this trade agreement will have tremendous benefits for those I represent. Just like Phase One of the China trade deal, this is another economic promise that President Trump has made good on. It was way past time for the outdated NAFTA agreement to be put in the shredder and to stand up for the American worker...the USMCA does that.     Visit to Pennex Aluminum Plant   One of my stops earlier today was in Leetonia at Pennex Aluminum. The company is an industry leader in the casting, extruding, and fabricating of aluminum products. While there, I visited and met with employees, toured the plant and learned about their recent 100,000 sq. ft. expansion in Columbiana County. It&#8217;s encouraging to see all of the local growth in the manufacturing industries. Afterwards, I headed down to Jefferson County for some more meetings and stops at small businesses. &nbsp;    NO to Proposed Jefferson County Landfill Like many of you in Jefferson County, I&#8217;ve been following the developments surrounding the old Crossridge Landfill. I&#8217;ve also heard from many of you directly regarding the situation, and I appreciate hearing your views on this important issue. Citizens are organizing against it, and know this&#8230;I stand with YOU for the future of Jefferson County. I&#8217;ve spoken with many local officials about this landfill issue, and we are all in agreement. Jefferson County is making very positive progress on several fronts, and now is not the time to lose this positive momentum. I have already conveyed my concerns about the landfill to officials at the Ohio EPA, and I plan on meeting with the Director of the Ohio EPA about this soon - I will be voicing OUR opposition. The first landfill on the site, which closed in 2016, was a total environmental disaster. We don&#8217;t need or want another dump site where other states can dump their garbage; they should find a way to handle their garbage in their own back yard.&nbsp;    Navigable Waters Protection Rule Announcement For years, businesses, farmers, energy developers, and landowners have asked the federal government to give them certainty and clarity when it comes to how federal clean water regulations affect the permitting process. The new Navigable Waters Protection Rule announced on January 24 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will provide exactly that - better certainty and clarity for the permitting process while protecting our water in Ohio and across the country. The Obama-era &#8220;Waters of the United States&#8221; rule - a serious case of regulatory overreach where Washington bureaucrats took over local decision making - is now gone. Again and again, I spoke up against this burdensome, intrusive rule imposed by the Obama Administration&#8217;s EPA. Right after I sent out last week&#8217;s eNewsletter, I discussed this new rule at an EPA and Army Corps of Engineers roundtable in Columbus. We talked about how this new rule right sizes the role of the federal government, and does not overstep its boundaries nor encroach on states&#8217; rights. For instance, the Ohio EPA already does a great job, because they live and work here in Ohio where they depend on the cleanliness of our water resources; they want their families and neighbors to have clean water, and they know the area better than someone sitting behind a desk in Washington. I look forward to working with the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to successfully implement this new rule in the days and years to come.&nbsp;   Thank you again for subscribing to my weekly District Download.

This plan is the centerpiece of our For the People Agenda and will work to both address the climate crisis and make our infrastructure smarter, safer and long-lasting. While that&#8217;s been happening, here&#8217;s what else I&#8217;ve been up to:&nbsp;    &nbsp;    Celebrating Chiropractor Day&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Perman this week on Chiropractor&#8217;s Day! We had a great discussion on the importance of chiropractic work in the field of medicine, and I am excited to see how the practice develops in the future of this country.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Remembering Terry DeCarlo  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  On Tuesday, we lost a pillar of the Orlando community &amp; a dedicated champion of LGBT rights. Although he will be greatly missed, we take comfort in knowing his work in the aftermath of the Pulse tragedy left a mark in the lives of dozens of families. Rest In Peace, Terry DeCarlo.  &nbsp;  Regulating Cell-based Meat  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I was also able to introduce the Cell-Cultured Meat Bill&nbsp;with Congressman Dusty Johnson, which aims to provide transparency and information about alternative meat products as they start to become more available to consumers.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Recognizing Tom Flores  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  With the Super Bowl around the corner in Miami, it is my distinct honor to present a resolution with Congressman Jim Costa which urges that Tom Flores, the first Hispanic player in the NFL, be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;    Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!

I was proud to co-lead this legislation with Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), and managed its passage on the Floor on Monday. The bill would amplify the work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, leveraging a combination of public and private funds to develop and disseminate high-quality Holocaust education resources, which can be adopted by local schools and included in their curriculum. The bill has the support of more than 1,800 Holocaust survivors from 38 states, as well as 350 organizations from across the country. On Monday, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the House reaffirmed its commitment to remembrance by passing this bill to ensure the next generation of students understand the dangers of rising anti-Semitism and recognize that it must never be forgotten. As we continue to condemn horrific acts of anti-Semitism across the world, we must also take proactive measures to educate and provide states and schools with the resources necessary to incorporate Holocaust education into their classrooms, ensuring that all students understand the evils of Holocaust and its impact. I am honored to co-lead this important legislation, and I applaud my colleagues in the House for its bipartisan passage.&nbsp;Watch my opening remarks on the House Floor in support of this legislation&nbsp;here and above, and my closing remarks&nbsp;here.  Statement on President Trump Signing USMCA Into Law    This week, I proudly attended the signing of the USMCA trade agreement into law by President Trump. This is a significant victory for the North Country, and I am thrilled that the USMCA has been signed into law. This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy. It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets. I have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers, and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these.

Advocating for Rural Broadband for the North Country&nbsp;  Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a draft proposal for their new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which rendered all of New York ineligible for the $16 billion allocated in Phase I of the plan to expand high-speed broadband access. I called the Chairman of the FCC directly and sent a bipartisan letter with the New York delegation asking them to reverse this decision, and to reiterate the need for underserved areas in the North Country to be included in the funding. This week, FCC Chairman Pai sent a letter back to me&nbsp; stating that the proposal will be revised and areas of New York will be considered for Phase I eligibility under the general criteria. Expanding access to high-speed broadband is critical to the economic well-being of our region.&nbsp; The FCC reversing their decision to categorically exclude New York is an important step in the right direction, as this will open the door to much needed investment in the areas of North Country that still lack broadband connectivity. However, the FCC&#8217;s treatment of areas without high-speed access despite some state investment will be central to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund fulfilling its goal of truly closing the digital divide. I will to continue to work closely with the FCC throughout the development of this important initiative to expand rural broadband access in the North Country. Read more here.&nbsp;  Testifying Before Ways &amp; Means Committee on Bipartisan Paid Leave Proposal    This week, I testified before the House Ways &amp; Means Committee in support of H.R. 5296, the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, legislation I am leading with Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX). This legislation will help working families cover the cost of parental leave, infant care, and other expenses that occur with birth or adoption of a new child by advancing up to $5,000 of their Child Tax Credit. It is the only bipartisan and bicameral plan to help new parents access upfront financial assistance &#8211; and does it without raising taxes or creating new federal mandates. Developing solutions to help new parents and working families thrive in this modern workforce is necessary for the continued economic success of our nation and the well-being of the next generation of Americans. I will always advocate on behalf of hardworking North Country families to bring them tangible benefits and enhanced paid leave options as I continue to lead this effort through the House. Watch my full testimony here and above.&nbsp;  Cosponsoring Bill Protecting Voter Registration Systems Against Foreign Hacking&nbsp;  This week, I became an original cosponsor of the Protect American Voters Act, legislation to provide states with more adequate resources to secure their current and future election systems. This bill updates the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by directing the Election Assistance Commission to issue guidelines for &#8220;non-voting&#8221; election equipment, including electronic pollbooks, election night reporting systems, online voter registration systems, and other equipment. It also establishes the first-ever &#8220;Election Cyber Assistance Unit&#8221; to connect local and state election officials with leading election administration and cybersecurity experts from across the country. Securing our elections includes prioritizing the protection of voter&#8217;s personal information, which has been at risk to foreign hacking for too long. I am proud to cosponsor this bill to ensure election equipment is utilized in a way that protects voter information, and that states are provided with resources and guidance to secure their individual election systems. I am a staunch advocate for measures to protect American elections from any foreign interference, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this effort. Read more here.  Announcing USDA Primary Agriculture Disaster Designation for the North Country&nbsp;  This week, I announced a USDA Primary Agricultural Disaster designation for all twelve counties in New York&#8217;s 21st Congressional District. This designation comes after excessive rain and weather events caused massive losses during the 2019 crop year. This designation makes farm operators eligible to be considered for certain assistance from the Farm Service Agency (FSA), including emergency loans. Farmers in these counties have 8 months from the date of this declaration to apply for emergency loans, and they are encouraged to act as soon as possible.&nbsp;The weather events this past spring, including excessive flooding in many areas, took a toll on farmers across upstate New York. I am glad USDA has made this designation and will be offering aid to producers, who are vital to the North Country. I encourage any farmers who have questions about this application process to reach out to my offices directly. Read more here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!    Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read:  Press Republican -&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials praise signing of USMCA  President Donald Trump's signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law drew praise from organizations and North Country officials.  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville) lauded ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement's (NAFTA) replacement as a significant victory for the region.  \"This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy,\" she said in a statement.  \"It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets.  I am proud to have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these.\"  North Country Chamber of Commerce President Garry Douglas said nothing is more important to the area's economy than its cross-border economic partnership with Canada.  \"With the enactment of the enabling legislation for USMCA, we can expect the continued benefits that will flow from a renewed and predictable economic relationship,\" he said in a statement.  \"The North Country, more than any other area of the U.S., has made itself a uniquely supportive environment for Canadian-based manufacturing in the U.S. market and for cross-border supply chains.\"  Douglas said the North Country's transportation equipment and aerospace cluster is a prime example, with 50 companies employing more than 9,000 people.  New York Farm Bureau President David Fisher said nearly half of the state's agricultural exports go to the country's North American neighbors.  \"Thanks to the president&#8217;s signature on USMCA, goods will continue to cross borders to benefit our state&#8217;s farms and rural economy,\" he continued.  \"The agreement provides certainty to farmers as well as opens the door to additional market opportunities, most notably for our dairy farms.\"  Douglas and Fisher thanked Stefanik for her support of the agreement's passage.  \"Congresswoman Stefanik has been in the forefront of passage of the USMCA that is essential to balance and strengthen the capability of North America&#8217;s competitiveness and enhancing U.S.-Canada economic vitality,\" Canadian/American Border Trade Alliance President/CEO Jim Phillips said.  Trump, former Mexican President Enrique Pe&#241;a Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the USMCA on Nov. 30, 2018.  The Mexican Senate ratified the agreement in June, and in December voted overwhelmingly to accept changes made as a result of negotiations between House Democrats and the White House. _________________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

Our brave service men and women, and their families, and all Americans deserve smart, strong and strategic action, not the Administration's reckless and rash policies.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Administration Reveals Illegal Medicaid Block Grant Scheme The Trump Administration&#8217;s Medicaid block grant guidance is the latest example of President&#8217;s obsession with taking away Americans&#8217; health care by any and all means.&nbsp; After being stopped in the Congress from repealing the health care law and destroying the lifeline of Medicaid, the Administration has decided to ignore the law and steal lifesaving health care from seniors and families anyway.&nbsp; The Administration&#8217;s plan for states to cap and slash Medicaid will have ruinous consequences for rural hospitals, for families seeking opioid addiction treatment for their loved ones and for middle-class seniors with long-term care needs.&nbsp;It would invite states to push Medicaid recipients off of lifesaving medicines, impose unaffordable premiums to maintain coverage and leave more vulnerable families exposed to catastrophic medical bills. At every turn, the Administration is working to undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions and to steal the promise of affordable, dependable health care.&nbsp;In the Congress and in the courts, Democrats will fight back against the Administration&#8217;s illegal block grant scheme to dismantle the health care of seniors and families. &nbsp;      &nbsp;  &nbsp;     A constituent contacted my office requesting help expediting her Social Security Administration disability benefits that had been awarded to her some time ago.

We will get to that America.&#8221; More than two decades later, I am still hopeful for an America where housing is treated as a human right.  This week, I joined my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus to launch a groundbreaking initiative to address the housing crisis and make housing a human right. I also continued to fight against the xenophobic Muslim Ban and challenged an outdated and dangerous law that gives the executive branch extreme power to target our immigrant communities. Last week I was home in Minneapolis hosting events on the housing and opioid crises our communities are facing in the 5th and around the country.&nbsp;  Despite the many systemic challenges we are facing in the district and around the country, I know that the struggles of today will bring us closer to the America of our dreams.  Thank you for being an engaged constituent. I look forward to hearing from you!  In service,    Ilhan Omar Member of Congress    UPCOMING EVENTS Join us for a Community Conversation with Congresswoman Omar on Combating Hate on Thursday, February 20 from 6:30-8:00 PM CST. RSVP on Eventbrite using this link.&nbsp; For all updates and upcoming events visit our website here. All events are free and open to the public.    Back in the District School Visit Being home means that I can do what I love most: visiting local schools, like Sandburg Middle School. I am always inspired by listening to our youth&#8217;s visions for a future where everyone is able to be their full self. You're never too young to engage in our democracy! Opioid Roundtable I hosted a vital discussion with the Cedar-Riverside community on the opioid crisis. Addressing this pressing problem requires a public health approach, which means we should not be criminalizing those struggling with addiction. I was grateful for the community wisdom on how we can heal our communities together. Town Hall I was joined by some of my brilliant partners in the district working to ensure that everyone in this country is granted their basic human right to safe and affordable housing. Guaranteeing Homes for All is a core part of addressing the climate crisis and preventing displacement, and we need bold policies to address the scale of the crisis we face. &nbsp;    No Ban Act On the third anniversary of the hateful Muslim Ban, I joined colleagues from the House and Senate to remind the President that we will not tolerate religious bigotry in this country. Here in the United States, the values that unite us are upholding civil liberties and ensuring basic human rights for all. We must remember that the fight to place the Muslim Ban in the dustbin of history does not end with its repeal. The stains of this policy and others like it will remain if we don&#8217;t collectively work to change hearts and minds so that we can truly treat each other as neighbors. &nbsp;   The People's Housing Platform This week, along with other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and housing justice advocates, we launched the People&#8217;s Housing Platform, which includes my Homes For All legislation. This groundbreaking, progressive housing framework declares what we know to be true: housing is a fundamental human right, and it is inextricably tied to the struggles for climate and racial justice. &nbsp;    Neighbors Not Enemies Act I also introduced the Neighbors Not Enemies Act, which fully repeals the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This outdated and dangerous law permits the President extreme executive powers to target an entire group of foreign nationals.  It is an offense to our values as a nation, which should stand as a refuge for those fleeing violence and persecution and is a perfect example of outdated immigration laws that are being exploited and abused by this Administration. As the President seeks to expand the Muslim Ban, we must close policy loopholes that he can exploit to cause harm to our neighbors, our country and the values that we hold dear.       &nbsp;  Stay Updated with the Office of Representative Ilhan Omar   Please do not respond to this e-mail.&nbsp;Contact the Office  &nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSCRIBE SERVICES  Unsubscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp; Privacy            ","district":"5","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"MN","party":"Democrat","score":2.1911578},{"name":"Congresswoman Yvette D.

Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, it&#8217;s easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t make progress by standing on the sidelines.&#8221; After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, we&#8217;re not surrendering. In fact, just the opposite: We&#8217;re fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect. It&#8217;s an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives. Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community. I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities. Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you. Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke     &nbsp;    Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents. Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve. Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market. These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home. In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments. The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers. Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings. I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act. This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex. My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes. New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.  &nbsp;     In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the President&#8217;s anti-immigrant agenda. My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R. 6) passed in the House of Representatives last year. According to H.R. 6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America. Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge.   Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the President&#8217;s xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, I&#8217;m committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census. It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community. We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive. Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts. Every person counts.        Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States. I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people. As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests.        Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities. Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R. 4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R. 4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on America&#8217;s national security.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residents&#8212;many in the Ninth District&#8212;were left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared. I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesn&#8217;t happen again. Brooklyn&#8217;s communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century. To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn. With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities. As a firm believer in Congress&#8217; ability to come together and combat this nation&#8217;s contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation.     I am proud that my bill H.R. 5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as &#8220;the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn.&#8221; My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy. Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007. At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing. Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all. In Major Owens&#8217; honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives.        My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell. This inaction is unacceptable. The fact is: background checks save lives. Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns. Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R. 1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm. From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence.        I&#8217;m proud that my bill, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act,&#8221; passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls. If you&#8217;ve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers. These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills. I know robocalls are more than annoying&#8212;they&#8217;re costly. My legislation, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act.&#8221; will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.        Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you. Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents. That&#8217;s why I take every opportunity to celebrate the community, whether it&#8217;s dancing with my friends and constituents at the yearly West Indian Day Parade or eating food from local restaurants and vendors at street fairs, such as the Park Slope 5th Avenue Street Fair.

Take a look at the article below and let me know if you support my efforts to combat this growing problem in Florida and across the country.  Vern    Congressional delegation to tackle spike in Florida human trafficking Jacob Ogles  In one ranking no one will brag about, Florida ranks third in the nation for reported human trafficking cases. As Florida&#8217;s Congressional Delegation met for the first time in 2020, the topic drove the agenda.  &#8220;Human trafficking is a vile crime against children and women that flourishes in the dark shadows of society,&#8221; said Rep. Vern Buchanan, Delegation co-chair. &#8220;We need to bring it into the light, expose these atrocities and end what amounts to modern-day slavery.&#8221;  Executives from Sarasota-based Selah Freedom flew to Washington to press for action. Elizabeth Fisher Good, the organization&#8217;s founder, testified that early education must be part of any effort to reduce human trafficking.  She said there must also be an awareness of online activity, a ubiquitous part of the modern teenage experience.  &#8220;1 out of 9 children are now approached on social media,&#8221; Fisher Good said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t stranger danger anymore. That&#8217;s why education starting in kindergarten is vital.&#8221;  Congress members also heard from Dr. Heidi Schaeffer, a member of the Broward Human Trafficking Coalition, who traveled to Washington, D.C. &#8220;to increase awareness of this issue to as many healthcare professionals as possible &#8211; plus to the general public.&#8221;  Rep. Alcee Hastings, Florida&#8217;s other Delegation co-chair, has been working with Buchanan&#8217;s office on bipartisan legislation. The Boca Raton Democrat and Sarasota Republican introduced the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Prevention Training Act of 2019 (HR 4388) in September. Eight of the bill&#8217;s 19 co-sponsors represent Florida districts.  &#8220;Human trafficking victims suffer unspeakable acts of violence and exploitation,&#8221; Buchanan said. &#8220;This bill will address the problem in our home state and across the country. Congress needs to move swiftly and get this measure to the President&#8217;s desk.&#8221;  Thirteen of Florida&#8217;s 27 Congress members attended the Delegation meeting.  There, they heard from national experts on the growing crime.  &#8220;When we launched the war on drugs, everyone knew there was a war on drugs,&#8221; said Roger DeHart, founder of the group First S.T.O.P. (Saving Teens And Others From Predators).  &#8220;If we took that same approach with human trafficking, we might have more of an impact.&#8221;            &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

In September 2019, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released a rule aimed at rolling back borrower defense protections, which allows students to receive loan forgiveness when they have been victims of predatory for-profit colleges, such as Corinthian or ITT Tech.  The rule creates a new three-year time limit for borrowers to submit loan forgiveness claims. It also requires defrauded students to prove personal financial harm in order to access relief. In addition, the rule requires the Department of Education to review every case individually, even if the institution had already been proven to have engaged in misconduct.  Count me opposed.  I voted with my&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;in the House of Representatives to overturn the Department of Education's rule&nbsp;and stand up for students defrauded by for-profit colleges throughout the United States. I fought for this resolution to protect students from institutions which award degrees that have no value, insurmountable debt, and no means of accessing justice.    On December 12, 2019, the House&nbsp;Committee on&nbsp;Education and Labor held a hearing examining the Department of Education&#8217;s implementation of Borrower Defense. During this hearing, I pressed Secretary DeVos on her efforts to undermine this vital policy.    I will always advocate on behalf of our nation's hardworking students.  Last year, I introduced legislation to make it easier for students defrauded by closed institutions to qualify for loan forgiveness. The Pell Grant Restoration Act&nbsp;would restore a student's Pell Grant eligibility to allow them the chance to get an education at a credible institution, which will provide them with the credentials necessary to succeed.  I will&nbsp;continue to champion student protections and ensure all people in the 5th District have access to a quality and affordable education.

After&nbsp;the better part of a generation and multiple administrations, we finally have a favorable trade agreement filled with big wins for the U.S. and two of our most valuable trade partners. The&nbsp;USMCA is vital to the growth and maintenance of our economy. It will add almost 200,000 American jobs&nbsp;and protect&nbsp;750,400 Florida jobs. For our country and especially for Florida, I'm proud President Trump and Congress worked together to pass this historic trade agreement.

The hearing this week on the Horseracing Integrity Act was an important step in advancing reforms to protect our equine athletes and jockeys. I remain firm in my belief that the future prosperity of this sport relies on uniformity of rules throughout the industry and I will continue to work to increase the popularity and public confidence in thoroughbred racing throughout the nation.

The impact of the Lexington Legends is no exception. The 2019 South Atlantic League Champion Legends bring an average economic impact of $47.2 million per year to our community, and in addition, donate an average of $1 million locally.

President Trump's legal defense team was given their first opportunity to defend the case against the articles of impeachment in the Senate. During there presentations, the President's legal team dismantled claims made by the Democrat impeachment managers and proved this has been a partisan impeachment charade since day one.&nbsp;  While Speaker Pelosi continues to waste her House majority on personal political vendettas, President Trump has been focused on strengthening America&#8217;s economy. He delivered another win for the American people by signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law which brings North American trade into the 21st century and is a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses. Along with delivering on the USMCA this week, President Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to lay out his bold plan for a peaceful two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.  &nbsp;   President Trump signs USMCA President Trump signed the historic USMCA deal delivering a victory for American workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses. USMCA will replace the previous NAFTA agreement that resulted in the loss of millions of American jobs and devastated communities across our county.Signing of the trade agreement creates 176,000 new jobs and adds $68 billion in new economic growth to the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;   President Trump speaking at the White House before signing the historic USMCA trade agreement.

HOYER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did you know that more&nbsp;than 40 million Americans have inaccurate credit reports, and consumer complaints about credit reports are one of the most submitted topics to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?&nbsp; This week I was pleased to bring the&nbsp;CREDIT Act to the House Floor and work to ensure its passage. This&nbsp;comprehensive bill will protect Maryland families and give individuals more control over their data. The legislation also:  Requires credit reporting companies like Equifax and Experian to ensure their reports are accurate;&nbsp; Shortens the amount of time negative information stays on your credit report; Restricts the use of credit information for employment; and Ensures that adverse information related to predatory loans is removed from your credit report.&nbsp;  This important legislation will make credit reporting more transparent and less cumbersome for consumers. I was glad to support the CREDIT Act, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take it up without delay.&nbsp;  As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my&nbsp;office&nbsp;or connecting with me on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, or&nbsp;Instagram.  &nbsp;  Sincerely Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Steny H.

When I came to Congress, I vowed to open four offices in order to serve constituents. I&#8217;m happy to say we followed through on this promise. If you live in Frederick County, stop by and say hello! We&#8217;re located at 10 Hillcrest Drive, Unit 28, Frederick, MD 21703 and open on Mondays and Thursdays from 9am to 5pm.    Last Sunday, I held my first ever &#8220;Community Conversation&#8221; focused on education issues at the Hagerstown coffee shop The Nook. During the event, members of the community and I gathered to talk about the importance of education and different initiatives to support students and educators. It was a lively discussion, and I left with some great new ideas. Thank you to everyone who came out!  At the end of the week, I met with members of the Maryland General Assembly to discuss some of my top priorities in Congress. I was excited to hear about the work Maryland legislators are doing to combat the opioid epidemic, pass meaningful criminal justice reform, and so much more. We need both federal and state action to make lasting change on these issues. I look forward to collaborating in the future.     EVENTS  You&#8217;re invited to my Seniors Workshop at the Washington County Free Library in Hagerstown on Tuesday, February 4th, from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm.     At this event, you will be able to learn and discuss important issues facing seniors in the community and across the nation. The workshop will feature a panel discussion of leading experts in the field as well as representatives from local and regional organizations who will provide resources and information to attendees.

I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk' Earlier today, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation formally agreeing to a landmark North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate. Senator McConnell said the following about today&#8217;s signing: &#8220;By signing the USMCA into law, President Trump has delivered a strong trade deal for Kentucky families. I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk, and I look forward to its benefits throughout the Commonwealth. Virtually every family and every industry in Kentucky is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Once the USMCA takes effect, Kentucky&#8217;s workers, farmers and consumers are ready to take advantage of all it has to offer.&#8221;    Recently Senator McConnell penned the following column for Kentucky newspapers:  Kentuckians are rightfully known for being hard workers. I&#8217;m glad more of them, from Paducah to Pikeville, are benefitting from our country&#8217;s strong economy, which has been bolstered by Republican policies. The Republican-led Senate gave Kentucky workers another boost in an overwhelming vote by passing President Trump&#8217;s landmark trade deal called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and I was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate. Once in effect, the USMCA will modernize the trading framework that sends American goods&#151;including Kentucky-made products like bourbon, cars, aerospace parts and agricultural commodities&#151;to customers across the continent. These critical upgrades reflect the development of the new digital economy, bringing the existing deal into the 21st century. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats held President Trump&#8217;s deal hostage for months on end. Their obsession with impeaching the duly-elected president unnecessarily delayed the USMCA and its benefits for Kentucky. American workers and families have paid the price of the Speaker&#8217;s refusal to work with President Trump. In Kentucky, the partisan obstruction couldn&#8217;t end soon enough. Virtually every family and every industry is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Farmers, manufacturers and logistics providers right here in the Bluegrass State put their ingenuity to work every day making a wide-range of products enjoyed around the globe.  In 2018 alone, we sent more than $10 billion of Kentucky-made products to Canada and Mexico, representing nearly one-third of all our Commonwealth&#8217;s exports. These sales support good jobs and a strong economy for Kentucky families. The USMCA is our chance to double-down on that success, giving our workers and our communities the certainty they need. The deal&#8217;s new, stronger automotive rules can extend the eye-popping 90 percent increase in motor vehicle exports Kentucky sold to our neighbors over the last decade. International sales of Kentucky-made cars and trucks can lead to more hiring, bigger paychecks and new investments. Just ask the folks in Georgetown&#151;where Toyota recently announced it will hire about 400 new workers&#151;about the benefits of trade. It&#8217;s not just auto-manufacturing, either. Nearly 19,000 Kentucky manufacturing jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, including at more than 500 small- and medium-sized businesses. One study estimated the USMCA could help create 176,000 American jobs, strengthening our country and generating new opportunities for families and communities. Kentucky&#8217;s farmers are ready to take advantage of USMCA&#8217;s innovations that will strengthen and expand markets for their crops. Canada and Mexico bought more than $300 million of the Bluegrass State&#8217;s agricultural products in 2018. At a time when Kentucky growers are tightening their belts, we should do everything in our power to encourage more consumers to buy their wonderful products. Job creators in our state have told me they can grow their businesses and benefit their communities with the USMCA. For example, the deal provides trade certainty to help our distillers by allowing more folks to raise a glass of Kentucky bourbon. Major Kentucky employers like UPS and DHL are also looking forward to USMCA&#8217;s improvements to e-commerce and customs processes, designed to better protect small businesses competing in the online marketplace. They&#8217;ll be able to better connect businesses and consumers, while protecting the environment and American workers.  By approving the deal, the United States is signaling to our neighbors that America is open for business. Once all three countries pass the USMCA, Kentucky&#8217;s workers, farmers and consumers are ready to enjoy all the benefits it has to offer.  Since the day President Trump signed the USMCA with leaders of Canada and Mexico, the deal should have been a no-brainer. Speaker Pelosi should&#8217;ve allowed this deal to pass months ago, but I&#8217;m glad the heel-dragging has come to an end. I hope Democrats will see what we&#8217;re able to accomplish by working together for the people who sent us to Washington in the first place. Then, they can put partisan distractions aside and work with us to continue delivering results.
