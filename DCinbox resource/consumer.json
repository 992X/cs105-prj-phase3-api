During the hearing I led my fellow Republican Members in highlighting the regulatory rightsizing championed by Congressional Republicans, the Trump Administration, and implemented by the Fed over the past year, which has played an important role in creating the best U.S. economy in modern history. Click here or on the image below to watch my opening remarks during last week's hearing. Our Economy is Strong During the State of the Union, President Trump highlighted our booming economy and how tax relief and trade deals like the USMCA are helping it continue to grow. The January jobs report is more proof of this good news. Not only were 225,000 new jobs added this month, January marked the 112th straight month of growth for the U.S. economy.

What I Have Been Reading Justice Department indicts four members of China's military for Equifax hack CNBC The 2017 Equifax breach jeopardized nearly 150 million Americans most sensitive and personal information. It was clear from the start that the bad actors behind this hack were dead set on causing harm to American consumers. The evidence in the indictment now shows the hack was a coordinated attempt by a foreign adversary to compromise and amass our personal data. Republicans will continue to offer proposals to not only safeguard our crucial credit reporting system, but to combat an aggressive China.

The budget proposal is pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth and pro-American. The President's budget also includes great news for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP). The budget includes full funding to keep the project on track. This is the fourth year in a row SHEP will receive full federal funding from the Trump Administration, pending Congressional passage of the annual appropriations bill. President Trump has again proven that the Trump administration understands the critical importance of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for our nation. The project is now well past the half way mark. While the finish line is finally in sight, I will continue to fight tirelessly for this federal support and to ensure the project is completed. Also this week, I announced that we secured a federal Department of Transportation grant of $34,600,000.00 for the Port of Savannah. The Port Infrastructure Development Grant is critical to straighten and realign Berth 1, one of the oldest areas of the Port, to increase efficiency. The funding will work to modernize the Berths to handle larger ships. This grant is necessary to ensure the Port is able to handle additional cargo. This announcement goes hand-in-hand with recent news, including the recent land acquisition, to increase port capacity and efficiency. I am excited that this federal funding will work to modernize the port, allow larger ships and increase the amount of cargo they will be able to move. I discussed President Trump's budget and the blockbuster week for the Port of Savannah in this week's edition of Buddy's Briefing. Click here to watch Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCLIII Monday, February 10, 2020: After an early morning flight back to Washington, Im in the House Chamber where I pay tribute to one of my favorite veterans, Paul Grassey from Savannah. Paul, a World War II veteran who is also a great singer and routinely leads us in patriotic songs at veterans events, has recently been given the French governments highest possible honor, the Legion of Honor, for his military service and role in helping to free France from Nazi occupation.

Later, I have a series of phone interviews to discuss President Trumps fiscal year 2021 budget proposal that was released today and includes full funding for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) for the fourth straight year. Funding this project was one of my top priorities when I took office five years ago and this good news should allow us to complete dredging by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. My first interview is with WTOC TV in Savannah, followed by the Savannah Morning News (SMN) and WJCL TV in Savannah. A link to these stories can be found here, here and here.

Once back in my office, I have a phone interview with WSAV TV in Savannah to discuss SHEP funding. A link to this interview can be found here. The good news on the Port of Savannah keeps coming as we find out today that we have secured a $34.6 million Department of Transportation (DOT) grant that will allow us to straighten and realign one of the oldest parts of the Port to accommodate larger ships. Before heading to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day, I have a phone interview with the SMN to discuss the grant. A link to the story can be found here. After votes, I remain in the House Chamber where I memorialize Ann Cox Chambers who recently passed. A link to my tribute can be found here. Rep.

While youre always glad to see someone better themselves, many are difficult to replace. After an early morning meeting with leadership to discuss election issues, I spend the next few hours in my office interviewing candidates for our health care legislative assistant position.

Rep. Carter visiting St. Simons Christian School Ive always said that interacting with students is my favorite part of serving in this position and today is another example why. What a great group of students! Because it is a small school, I get to visit each classroom from pre-K through 5th and then meet with the 6th through 8th grade classes as a group. They ask great questions and I thoroughly enjoy my visit. Afterwards, I head to Sea Island where my good friend, Jonathan RacIin, has assembled an outstanding group of community leaders for a round table discussion on national and world issues.

In my remarks, I urged us all to remember President Lincoln's insightful words, \"A house divided against itself, cannot stand.\" I look forward to continuing to work together in unity with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to benefit all Americans.  Continue reading for a brief update on my work on your behalf last week.  Advocating for our Heroes  It was a pleasure to meet with Dr. Miguel LaPuz, VA VISN 8 Director. We discussed issues impacting local Veterans, and current plans to expand the Zephyrhills Clinic and North Pinellas VA clinics. I appreciate his commitment to ensure Veterans receive the care they deserve and look forward to continuing to work with him on critical improvements to the system.   In last week&#8217;s VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Hearing we discussed a variety of draft bills to help improve educational opportunities for Veterans. This included my legislation to modernize GI Bill certificate of eligibility processing, as well as bills I support that would improve the STEM education and VET-TECH programs. Click here to listen to my remarks during the hearing. Additionally, I was glad to see this bill I supported signed into law last week. It will help Veterans develop the skills and educational acumen to attain lucrative jobs in STEM industries. Protecting Patients  Last week, I was proud to become the newest member of the Congressional ALS Caucus. ALS a debilitating and horrific disease that claims the life of many Americans far too soon. Additionally, a disproportionate number of Veterans have been diagnosed with ALS, which is alarming. I have long been a supporter of legislation and federal funding designed to increase research that will lead to better treatments and cures for rare diseases, like ALS. However, as an active member of the ALS Caucus, I will be able to do even more. I join this caucus in honor of Doug, who is a constituent, a Veteran and a friend of mine. Doug has bravely battled ALS for almost 15 years. I am inspired by Doug&#8217;s courage, his family&#8217;s commitment and by his best friend, Gary, who has become a fierce and vocal advocate for all ALS patients who struggle with this disease. Together, I am optimistic that our Caucus can be a catalyst for change and that we will do what it takes to find a cure.   It was great to meet with local leaders from Advent Health Hospitals last week. They were in town to discuss how we can improve transparency in healthcare costs and protect patients from surprise medical bills.&nbsp; Surprise medical billing typically occurs when a patient receives an unexpected bill after a medical procedure due to items that were not covered by his/her insurance.&nbsp; As I promised the leaders from Advent Health, I will continue to work on fixing this problem.   Additionally, in last week&#8217;s Health Subcommittee hearing, I appreciated the chance to share stories from women in my district who feel strongly about the need to protect the sanctity of life. Click here to listen to me share their words.  Learning from You  I had the distinct pleasure of meeting with Florida athletes from this year&#8217;s Special Olympics and listen to their inspirational stories. This wonderful program promotes inclusion, celebrates diversity and encourages us all to reach our highest potential.   I also had the opportunity to meet with visually impaired and blind constituents who are members of the National Federation for the Blind. We discussed accommodations and assistive technologies that can be utilized to ensure those with disabilities are fully able to participate in society. As someone with significant visual impairments myself, I am grateful for their work and continued advocacy. I will continue to support their efforts.   One of my favorite parts of the job is having the opportunity to meet with young people and listen to their ideas about how to improve our nation. Last week, I was fortunate to meet with students from Sunlake High School in Land O' Lakes. They were in D.C. as part of the Junior State of America program. I found them to be bright, insightful and optimistic about the future.   I was honored to meet with a constituent from Palm Harbor, Mr. Joe Hedger, who owns a local small business. We discussed the need to invest in sustainable infrastructure projects throughout the nation, and the need for national standards on composites and other new manufacturing technology.   Additionally, I will be hosting a teletown hall this Wednesday, February 19, 2020 at 6:00 p.m. This forum allows a maximum number of constituents to participate. On average, several thousand constituents join in each teletown hall for the entire hour-long exchange. This is just one of the multiple ways that I communicate with my constituents on a regular basis. I look forward to the opportunity to provide a brief update of what I have been working on in Washington and answering your questions. The system will be randomly dialing constituents; however, if you want to ensure your participation you can call in directly at 1-888-480-3641.  Ensuring Public Safety  In last week&#8217;s Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee we discussed proposed legislation to encourage innovation and safety in the regulation of autonomous vehicles. We want to benefit from the major advances this technology will offer while ensuring that the public is protected. I am grateful that legislation I authored is currently being negotiated into the bipartisan package. My bill would ensure that seniors and those with disabilities are considered when developing regulations for this new technology. Strengthening Strategic Alliances  Andy Athens and Maynard Wishner led efforts by Greek- American and American-Jewish communities to strengthen ties between Greece and Israel. Each year an Athens-Wishner award is given to an individual for showing leadership on Eastern Mediterranean issues and for bolstering the relationship between the Jewish and Hellenic diasporas. I was proud to receive this prestigious honor last week.   Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent.  &#8220;Congressman Bilirakis has a caring and efficient staff who are concerned about and serve their constituents. I greatly appreciate all that you have done to help me with the Department of Veteran&#8217;s Affairs. It took only a few days (instead of up to 6 weeks) for the VA to acknowledge my Medicare. Thank you for supporting disabled service connected veterans and their spouses.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  While I'm away in Washington, I have a team of am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team was happy to join the Dade City Chamber of Commerce and help celebrate the ribbon cutting for ACE Hardware Store.   My team enjoyed the unveiling of 40 new exhibits at the West Pasco Historical Society, Dr. Rao Musunuru Library. It is wonderful to see a celebration of our community's rich cultural heritage and a desire to preserve the past.   During last week's Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce meeting, my team enjoyed learning about the importance of preventative eye care and screenings from Dr. Grace Levy-Clarke from the University of South Florida.  My team enjoyed meeting with U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia during his visit to Tampa last week. He discussed the strength of our economy and plans to increase apprenticeship programs throughout the nation.      Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update.

As I said on the House floor, I am an equal to every one of my male colleagues in Congress until I walk out the door and down the steps of the Capitol. Then I am relegated to second-class status because women are not recognized in our country's founding document, the Constitution, as fully equal to men under the law. The vote to pass&nbsp;H.J.Res.79&nbsp;was a vote for equality, justice, sisterhood, motherhood, survival, dignity, and respect. It was a vote for the American dream &#8211; to be on the same footing as everyone else in order to pursue our greatest potential. It&nbsp;was a vote for the America that we have fought so hard to become, and&nbsp;for that more perfect union.  But as we celebrated this historic milestone, the Trump Administration continued it's assault on our most cherished democratic norms. From ratcheting up its attacks on&nbsp;environmental protections, to crafting and enforcing even more&nbsp;xenophobic and cruel immigration policies, the President continues to&nbsp;seek to divide Americans and foment a climate of fear, anger, and mistrust. It is no coincidence that Russia, and other foreign adversaries, are working once again to capitalize on the resentment and suspicion that this President counts on to maintain his power. That is why I am sharing&nbsp;this edition of Jackie's Reading Picks with you; a collection of articles, essays,&nbsp;and editorials that provide valuable insight and context for what is happening&nbsp;and what we can do to ensure that our core principles and values as Americans remain steadfast.&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;you will find them as informative, instructive, and, in some cases, as&nbsp;inspiring as I did.  Thank you for reading and all my best,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                       As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

U.S. House removes ERA ratification deadline, one obstacle to enactment By Patricia Sullivan, The Washington Post      &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;       The 232-to-183 vote, on a resolution introduced by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), pushes the issue to the Senate, where Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have introduced a similar measure. During debate on the House floor, Republicans leaned on antiabortion and constitutional arguments to oppose the ERA, arguing that enshrining protections for women in the Constitution would mean abortion could not be restricted. Democrats focused on the legality of deadlines and the importance of equal rights. &#8220;This has nothing to do with the abortion issue. That is an excuse, not a reason,&#8221; said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that women are still paid less than men for similar work, and often are shorted on pensions and maternity leaves.

In January, Radio Sputnik, a propaganda arm of the Russian government, started broadcasting on three Kansas City-area radio stations during prime drive times, even sharing one frequency with a station rooted in the city&#8217;s historic jazz district. &#8220;Who needs a ridiculous Red Dawn invasion,&#8221; a participant in one online forum wrote about the new broadcasts. &#8220;Your overlord, Mr. Putin, will be addressing you soon, so it&#8217;s best to prepare now,&#8221; another commenter wrote, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In the United States, talk radio on Sputnik covers the political spectrum from right to left, but the constant backbeat is that America is damaged goods.

By Robinson Meyer, The Atlantic  They had made the same call dozens of times before. For nearly a decade, the EPA team had worked closely with another group of engineers in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, pronounced nits-uh) to write the federal tailpipe-pollution standards, one of the most consequential climate protections in American history. The two teams had done virtually all the technical research&#8212;testing engines in a lab, interviewing scientists and automakers, and overseeing complex economic simulations&#8212;underpinning the rules, which have applied to every new car and light truck, including SUVs and vans, sold in the United States since 2012. Their collaboration was historic. Even as SUVs, crossovers, and pickups have gobbled up the new-car market, the rules have pushed the average fuel economy&#8212;the distance a vehicle can travel per gallon of gas&#8212;to record highs. They have saved Americans $500 billion at the pump, according to the nonpartisan Consumer Federation of America, and kept hundreds of millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air. So as the call connected, Alson and the other EPA engineers thought it was time to get back to work. Donald Trump had recently ordered a review of the rules.

How several agents from a small outpost in Arizona, including recently retired chief Carla Provost, climbed to the top of the Border Patrol, then one by one retired, leaving corruption, misconduct and a toxic culture in their wake. By Melissa del Bosque, ProPublica  The party was adorned with a who&#8217;s who in Border Patrol leadership, past and present. There was the unmistakable figure of Luck&#8217;s boss, Chief Carla Provost, tall and broad with her trademark fringe of brown bangs, and her longtime friend Andrea Zortman, who helps oversee foreign operations for the agency. A full contingent of retired former chiefs-turned-consultants were on hand, too, including David Aguilar, 64, who&#8217;d headed the Border Patrol as well as its parent, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Michael Fisher, 55, who&#8217;d succeeded Aguilar as Border Patrol chief. Rowdy Adams, 59, another retired senior-level CBP official, also attended the celebration. The guests had kicked in $75 apiece to cover food and a gift for the send-off, but hovering over the party was a mix of weariness and defiance: It wasn&#8217;t just the end of Luck&#8217;s career, it was the end of an era at the agency &#8212; their era. And the widespread critiques currently pummeling the embattled patrol and its more than 19,600 agents would be, implicitly, their legacy. To read the complete article, click here.

Last month was the hottest January in the history of our planet. The last five years were the hottest five years on Earth. Climate change is real, and signs of the climate crisis are all around us. The world watched in horror as millions of acres of trees burned in Australia&#8217;s recent bushfires, killing one billion animals. Rising sea levels, flooding, and other extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and destructive. That&#8217;s why, earlier this week, I introduced the Clean Economy Act with 33 of my Senate&nbsp;colleagues, legislation that would jumpstart government-wide climate action and move our country to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. The world&#8217;s leading scientists have told us that, to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, we need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Period.&nbsp;To do that, we &#151; all of us here on this planet &#151; need to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by mid-century.&nbsp;But time is running out. Our bill is the quickest way we can jumpstart government-wide climate action, by empowering agencies to use the tools they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Clean Economy Act empowers EPA to use tools already at its disposal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than mid-century. Our legislation also sets important guardrails to make sure all Americans reap the benefits as we move the country toward net-zero emissions: 1.&nbsp;EPA must maximize greenhouse gas emissions reductions while minimizing costs to consumers and providing regulatory flexibility to industry. 2.&nbsp;EPA must consider and protect frontline communities, because we know climate change disproportionately affects impoverished and disadvantaged communities, communities of color and indigenous communities. 3.&nbsp;In its net-zero plan,&nbsp;EPA must use American workers, domestic materials and strong labor standards to get the job done &#150; relying on our country&#8217;s talents to make the transition to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. The Clean Economy Act will put the United States on a path to once again lead the world in the fight against climate change while lifting up American communities and workers. In the coming weeks, I will continue encouraging my colleagues to join us in supporting the Clean Economy Act, because our planet can&#8217;t wait. It&#8217;s time we take on the challenge of addressing&nbsp;the climate crisis and seize the economic opportunity that comes with it.

Not only did I have the joy of seeing these babies when they were delivered, but throughout my career I witnessed great advances in the technology that allowed doctors and parents to see these children developing in the womb. For those of us who have watched a baby squirm and kick during a sonogram, there is no question about the sanctity of life.&nbsp;  While my work has changed through the years &#8211; I now spend late nights delivering policy rather than babies &#8211; my dedication to pro-life medicine remains steadfast.  The legislation that came before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health this week would put women's health at risk.  The Women's Health Protection Act of 2019, would codify into law that access to an abortion is essential to women&#8217;s health. This is contrary to the Founders of this country who believed in a right to life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The federal government should work to overcome the factors that lead to abortions and should support well-crafted legislative proposals that directly address these factors. That is not this bill.  MY WEEK President Trump delivered his budget to Congress. In line with his State of the Union address, the Best is Yet to Come, this is a budget for America&#8217;s future.&nbsp;It lays the foundation to balance the budget over the next 15 years by stopping unnecessary spending.&nbsp;The budget continues the President&#8217;s priorities to rebuild our military, secure our borders, protect our economy, and&nbsp;remain energy independent.&nbsp;  I joined Government CIO to discuss the benefits of electronic health records and of AI in health care.&nbsp; After that I participated in an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce hearing on autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles will reduce traffic congestion, improve mobility for the elderly and individuals with disabilities, and could significantly improve safety for all who use our roadways.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Hill published my opinion article about the future of energy policy in America: \"A Free Market for a Clean Future.\"  Yesterday, I attending the visitation for Midshipman Duke Anthony Carrillo of Flower Mound, Texas. &nbsp;I had the honor to nominate him and his two brothers to a U.S. Service Academy. He was an aspiring young man. May others learn from his example and follow in his footsteps.

Passage was one more step toward making the Equal Rights Amendment the 28th&nbsp;Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and eliminating discrimination based on sex. Before the vote, I spoke from the House floor in favor of the measure. See my release on the vote, and my speech, here. On Monday, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, I testified before the House Rules Committee, urging it to adopt a rule for consideration of the measure. See my release and the testimony here.&nbsp;  Helping Introduce and Cosponsoring the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act&nbsp;   On Wednesday, I helped introduce the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act. This comprehensive measure would phase out some single-use plastic products, incentivize consumers to recycle by creating a national 10-cent refund program for all beverage containers, require plastic producers to design and finance programs to collect waste, and reform our broken waste and recycling collection system. See my release and my remarks at&nbsp;the&nbsp;press conference rolling out the measure here.&nbsp;  Investigating the Politicization of the Department of Justice&nbsp;   On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve as a senior member, announced that Attorney General William Barr would testify before the Committee in March to address concerns regarding his leadership and the politicization of the Department of Justice (DOJ). President Trump has repeatedly pressured the DOJ to pursue his political enemies and help his allies who have committed serious crimes. This undermines the rule of law and threatens our national values. Read the Committee&#8217;s press release here. See my interview with CNN&#8217;s Poppy Harlow on the situation here.&nbsp;  Demanding Credible Evidence from Amtrak CEO on Food Service Changes&nbsp;   Also Wednesday, as a senior member of the House Transportation&nbsp;and Infrastructure Committee&#8217;s&nbsp;Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, I wrote to Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson to ask for credible evidence&nbsp;to support&nbsp;his decision to suspend dining car food service on some long-distance routes.&nbsp; See my release and the letter here.&nbsp;  Reacting to the President&#8217;s Harmful Budget Proposal&nbsp;  On Monday, President Trump released a destructive budget proposal that prioritizes special interests and the rich and powerful over the health, safety, and economic security of American families. For example, the Trump budget cuts $1.6 trillion from health care programs over 10 years. This includes a more than $900 billion cut to Medicaid, a half a trillion-dollar cut to Medicare, and more than $200 billion in cuts to other health programs. It would also cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and critical research dollars for cures for catastrophic diseases at the National Institutes of Health. It would also cut Social Security benefits by $24 billion -- despite the President&#8217;s previous claims he would leave Social Security alone -- and $292 billion over 10 years from mandatory programs that support working families. The federal budget should be a statement of values. Once again the President is showing just how little he values the well-being of hard-working Americans. House Democrats will reject this heartless budget.&nbsp;  Making Information about U.S. Census Jobs Available&nbsp;    Every ten years, the U.S. Census Bureau counts the number of people living in the United States for the purpose of reapportioning the U.S. House of Representatives&#8217; 435 seats among the 50 states. That requires a huge temporary workforce. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are now available for Census field supervisors, Census takers, clerks and other positions. In Shelby County, the pay ranges between $20 and $22 per hour with reimbursement for mileage and expenses. To qualify, you must be at least 18, have a valid Social Security number, a valid email address and pass a criminal background check. To apply, go here.&nbsp;  Introducing the MEAL Act&nbsp;&nbsp;  On Friday, I introduced the Making Essentials Affordable and Lawful (MEAL) Act to lift restriction on the receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)&nbsp;and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)&nbsp;for people with prior&nbsp;drug&nbsp;felony convictions, ensuring that they can meet their basic needs as soon as they reenter society. See my release on the measure here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign Up for &#8220;Congress on Your Corner&#8221; and this e-Newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies.

This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year. This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model. It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference. In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area. I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our country&#8217;s food and agriculture interests. Read more here,&nbsp;  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products. The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.&nbsp;I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient. This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.&nbsp;For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products. Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store. Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as &#8220;milk&#8221;. I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law.

This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game. NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!  Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce.&nbsp;   It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing. In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease. I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases. I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.   I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards. I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress. Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events. The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees. This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires. Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance. This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base. Read more here.  Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving on&#8239;our embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts. This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted. As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical. Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders. Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots. We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and I&#8217;m honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress. Read more here.  Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown. The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities.&nbsp; Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns. Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities. I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.

Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for \"absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies\" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases. Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines &#8211; though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks.  \"New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,\" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

The resolution passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Today marks two years since the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t think about the 17 lives we lost far too soon, and I&#8217;m proud to introduce this resolution honoring them with Senator Rubio. Over the past two years, I&#8217;ve worked closely with the families of the victims to make our schools safer and prevent future tragedies. We passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act while I was Governor and now I&#8217;m fighting for improvements on the federal level, including the Luke and Alex School Safety Act. While our hearts are still heavy with loss we cannot undo, we must do everything in our power to honor the memory of the victims and ensure no family has to go through this pain again.&#8221; &#151;  Also this week, Senator Rick Scott introduced:   A resolution applauding the University of West Florida Argonauts football team for its National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II national championship victory; Legislation to close a loophole that has allowed U.S. technology companies to sell products to Huawei, which the&nbsp;U.S. Government has determined to be a national security threat;&nbsp; The Taiwan SOS Act, which would allow diplomats and service members in the Taiwanese military to display their flag and wear their uniforms while in the U.S. on official businesses; and The Medical License Verification Act to prevent fraud in the healthcare system.

Rick Scott Applauds President Trump&#8217;s Commitment to Protecting Everglades  Senator Rick Scott applauded President Trump for including $250 million for Everglades Restoration in his Fiscal Year 2021 budget requests to Congress. This follows the letter Senator Scott and Senator Rubio sent to President Trump requesting the $250 million.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I applaud President Trump for working with the Florida delegation to commit to fight for $250 million in federal funding for Everglades restoration projects this year. This funding builds on the $200 million in construction funding for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration we fought for and secured last year, as well as the $2 billion in state funding invested in restoring the Everglades throughout my time as Governor. Everglades restoration is critically important to the State of Florida and enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress. I applaud the Administration&#8217;s commitment to protecting Florida&#8217;s natural treasures for generations to come.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Calls on World Health Organization to do Independent Analysis of Coronavirus  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) urging the WHO to do its own in-depth analysis on the extent of the Coronavirus. Since Communist China cannot be trusted to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner when it comes to combatting the threat of the virus, every resource must be available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Calls on General Secretary Xi to Extradite Perpetrators of the Equifax Breach  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement calling on General Security of the Communist Party Xi to hold four members of Communist China&#8217;s military accountable after the Justice Department charged them with the massive Equifax data breach in 2017.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;China continues to steal our intellectual property and personal information. While General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi claims that his goal is to improve relations between our two countries, his actions send another message. If he&#8217;s serious about working with the United States to improve our relationship, he should immediately extradite the military officials that were charged by the Justice Department for the Equifax breach in 2017. If General Security Xi and Communist China fail to do so, it will just be another sign that their promise of improved economic and political relations was more empty rhetoric from an adversary intent on competing with the United States on a global scale.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Questions Pandemic Experts on Efforts to Protect Americans from Coronavirus  During a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs roundtable on global pandemics, Senator Rick Scott questioned experts regarding the threat of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Senator Scott continues to work with the administration to protect the health of American families.&nbsp;Watch video from the roundtable HERE or below.    &#151; Sen. Rick Scott Introduces the Medical License Verification Act  Senators Rick Scott, John Cornyn, Chris Van Hollen and Catherine Cortez Masto introduced the Medical License Verification Act to prevent fraud in the healthcare system by requiring the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to verify that an applicant&#8217;s medical license is valid and in good standing prior to issuing them a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, which is required by healthcare providers to bill for insurance.&nbsp;  Under current law, CMS issues NPI numbers without verification of the licensure information submitted, which allows non-physicians to obtain NPI numbers and opens up the possibility that they may fraudulently bill commercial health insurance.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Under our current system, loopholes exist that have allowed non-doctors to fraudulently bill health insurance companies to the tune of millions of dollars, which ultimately gets passed along to the consumer. This is unfair and it has to stop. The Medical License Verification Act is a small and commonsense step to address this weakness and prevent bad actors from defrauding families.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Joins Sen. Ted Cruz and Colleagues to Introduce the&nbsp;Taiwan SOS Act  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Ted Cruz and colleagues in introducing the Taiwan Symbols of Sovereignty (Taiwan SOS) Act, which would allow diplomats and service members in the Taiwanese military to display their flag and wear their uniforms while in the United States on official businesses. &nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;As Communist China continues to try to crack down on Taiwan&#8217;s freedoms, it&#8217;s more important than ever that the United States stand strong with our ally. Taiwan is an incredible reminder of the power of democracy around the world, and I&#8217;m proud to co-sponsor this important bill to support our friends in Taiwan.&#8221; Read more from Senator Ted Cruz's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Introduces Legislation to Crack Down on U.S. Companies Selling to Huawei  Senator Rick Scott introduced legislation to close a loophole that has allowed U.S. technology companies to sell products to Huawei, which the&nbsp;U.S. Government has determined to be a national security threat and continues to be a bad actor across the globe. U.S. exports to Huawei have been banned, but some U.S. companies are finding ways around the blacklisting, including supplying Huawei through subsidiaries or partners in foreign countries.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We know Huawei is supported and controlled by the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights and steal our data, technology, and intellectual property. Companies&nbsp;in the United States should not be allowed to sell to Huawei, and my legislation will further restrict their ability. I look forward to all of my colleagues and the Administration joining in support of my proposal to crack down on U.S. exports to Huawei, protect our national security and the security and growth of the U.S. technology industry.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Calls on FDA to Confirm Pharmaceutical Imports from Communist China are Safe Amid Coronavirus  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following the FDA&#8217;s recent decision to remove the agency&#8217;s inspectors of Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities from the country in response to the Chinese Coronavirus outbreak. Senator Scott is focused on making sure that all products being imported from China are safe for American families. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.              Sen.

K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960. The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.&nbsp;Read the press release and full resolution here.  Background:    The Greensboro Four sit-in protest took place on February 1, 1960. The Greensboro sit-in was a civil rights protest that commenced when four young Black students staged a sit-in at the segregated lunch counter of F.W. Woolworth Department Store in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Greensboro Four: Jabreel Khazan (Ezell Blair Jr.), David Richmond, Franklin McCain and Joseph McNeil were students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, now known as North Carolina A&amp;T State University. Nationwide participation in this new movement included over 700,000 people, including students, clergymen and unified citizens both White and Black. On July 26, 1960, the Woolworth Lunch Counter was finally integrated.    &nbsp;     CBC Leadership Summit&nbsp;        &nbsp;    On February 4, 2020, the Congressional Black Caucus hosted the 2020 National Black Leadership Summit. Over 600 Black leaders from around the country joined the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C. to call national attention to two critical issues facing the Black community: the 2020 Census and Voting Rights.&nbsp; Both have implications for the development of Black communities in the short and long term.&nbsp; The Summit also&nbsp;featured one of North Carolina's own, Rev. Dr. William Barber II, who delivered the keynote address.&nbsp; Recording of the February 4, 2020 Summit can be viewed on the Congressional Black Caucus' Facebook page&nbsp;here.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Fighting for Medicaid Protections     &nbsp;  &nbsp;   On February 6, 2020, Congressman Butterfield spoke on the House floor in opposition to the Trump Administration's illegal Medicaid block grant scheme which would threaten access to healthcare for millions of North Carolinians including vulnerable children and those who are low income, elderly, and disabled. The House of Representatives passed a resolution to disapprove of the Trump administration&#8217;s latest plan to allow states to convert part of their Medicaid programs into block grants. See Butterfield's full speech here.&nbsp;  &nbsp;     Legislative Update&nbsp;       On January 30, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congressman Billy Long (MO-07) introduced the&nbsp;Protecting Natural Gas Consumers from Overcharges Act of 2020.&nbsp; The bipartisan bill aims to protect natural gas consumers, residential and industrial, from overpaying for their use of natural gas.&nbsp; The bill amends the National Gas Act to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to set a refund effective date and order a refund when an interstate pipeline is found to be overcharging for its services.&nbsp; FERC currently has these authorities under the Federal Power Act to order refunds from interstate electric utilities when they determine overcharges have been made. On January 28, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960. The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.&nbsp; On January 27, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-1) and Congressmen Mike Conaway (TX-11) introduced H. Res. 810, a resolution to recognize Free File, a public-private partnership allowing low- and moderate-income taxpayers to use tax preparation software and e-filing services at no cost to the government.     Constituent Success Story     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  The district office in Durham received a request for help from a 95-year-old widow of a WWII Veteran for assistance with the Department of Veterans Affairs. For many years, this constituent had not received her benefits and the Durham&nbsp;office staff&nbsp;was determined to find a solution. After extensive research, many emails, calls and conversations, the district staff was able to identify the error and secured a back payment of &nbsp;$14,323 as well as a $979 a month pension for the rest of the constituent's life. The constituent and her family expressed deep gratitude for the help of the Durham staff. It is an honor to serve as advocates for the constituents of North Carolina's First Congressional District.

The impeachment trial is both a symptom of our times and another example of our division. At the beginning of our nation, we did not have an impeachment inquiry of a president for almost 100 years with the partisan impeachment of Andrew Johnson. After more than 100 years, another impeachment inquiry was conducted when the House began a formal impeachment inquiry into President Nixon in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410-4. Within a period of weeks, President Nixon resigned before he was formally impeached. Then, just over two decades later, President Clinton was impeached by the House, on another mostly partisan vote leading to a partisan acquittal in the Senate.&nbsp;  This season of our history and has been referred to as the Age of Investigations and the Age of Impeachment. We have had multiple special counsels since 1974 over multiple topics. This is more than just oversight; it has been a unique time in American history when the politics of the moment have driven rapid calls for investigation and impeachment. Over the past three years, the House of Representatives has voted four times to open an impeachment inquiry: once in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019. Only the second vote in 2019 actually passed and began a formal inquiry.&nbsp;  The Mueller investigation that consumed most of 2018 and 2019 answered many questions about Russian attacks on our voting systems&#8212;though no votes were changed&#8212;but it was also a $32 million investigation that took more than two years of America&#8217;s attention. For the last four months the country has been consumed with impeachment hearings and investigations. The first rumors of issues with Ukraine arose August 28 when Politico published a story about US foreign aid being slow-walked for Ukraine, and then on September 18 when The&nbsp;Washington Post published a story about a whistleblower report that claimed President Trump pressured an unnamed foreign head of state to do an investigation for his campaign.&nbsp;  Within days of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Washington Post story on September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House would begin hearings to impeach the President, which led to the formal House vote to open the impeachment inquiry on October 31 and then a vote to impeach the President on December 18th. But after the partisan vote to impeach the President, Speaker Pelosi held the articles of impeachment for a month before turning them over to the Senate, which began the formal trial of the President of the United States on January 16, 2020. After hearing hours of arguments from both House Managers and the President&#8217;s legal defense team and Senators asking 180 questions to both sides, the trial concluded February 5, 2020. Key Dates to Know&nbsp;   April 21, 2019 - President Zelensky is elected President of Ukraine. May 21 - President Zelensky sworn in. After the ceremony, President Zelensky abolishes Parliament and calls for quick (snap) elections on July 21. July 21 &#8211; Ukrainian Parliamentary elections. President Zelensky&#8217;s party wins a huge majority. July 25 - President Trump calls President Zelensky to congratulate him and his party. August 12 - An unnamed whistleblower working in the US intelligence community filed a complaint that he had heard from others that the President of the United States had tried to pressure President Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden on an official phone call July 25, 2019. August 26 - The Inspector General for the Intelligence Community declares the whistleblower report &#8220;an urgent matter&#8221; and asks for its release within seven days. The Justice Department looks over the report and notes that though it was written by a person in the intelligence community, it is not related to intelligence matters, so it does not fall within the Inspector General&#8217;s jurisdiction and it is forwarded on to the Department of Justice for review.&nbsp; August 28 - Politico publishes a story that the annual military aid for Ukraine is currently being slow-walked. September 9 - The Inspector General contacts the House Intelligence Committee to let them know that he has not been able to release the whistleblower report to their committee. September 13 - The House Intelligence Committee subpoenas the whistleblower report.

Important Context of What Was Happening in Ukraine  Ukraine became independent in 1991 when it broke away from the Soviet Union, but the Ukrainians have faced constant pressure from Russia ever since. In 2014 Ukraine forced out its pro-Russia president, and Moscow retaliated by taking over Crimea (and stealing the Ukrainian Navy), then rolling tanks into eastern Ukraine and taking all of eastern Ukraine by force. Russian and Ukrainian troops continue to fight every day in eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;  The people of Ukraine face an aggressive Russia on the east and pervasive Soviet era corruption throughout the government and the business community. President Trump met the previous President of Ukraine in 2017 to talk about other countries helping Ukraine with greater military support funds and to ask how Ukraine could address corruption on a wider scale. The two Presidents also spoke about lethal aid (allowing the Ukrainians to buy sniper rifles, anti-tank javelin missiles, and other lethal supplies) to help them fight the invading Russians. The US also started sending a couple hundred American troops to train Ukrainian soldiers in the far west of Ukraine.&nbsp;  Ukrainian&nbsp;President Zelensky  On April 21, 2019, President Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected as the new President of Ukraine. He was a sitcom actor/comedian who had no political experience, but was well known for his television show in which he played the part of a corruption-fighting teacher who was elected as President of Ukraine. His television popularity helped him win the election, but when he was sworn in on May 21, he was relatively unknown to most of the world.&nbsp;  On the same day as his inauguration, May 21, President Zelensky abolished Parliament and called for snap elections to put his party in power. With a new president in place and parliamentary elections in Ukraine coming, starting in June of 2019, the President ordered foreign aid to Ukraine to be held until the end of the fiscal year, but agencies were informed that they should do all the preliminary work needed before the aid was sent, so it would be ready to release at a moment&#8217;s notice. The leadership in Ukraine was not notified that there was a hold on their foreign aid.&nbsp;  The new Parliament was elected on July 21, and President Zelensky&#8217;s party won by a landslide. By mid-August, the new Parliament was working on anti-corruption efforts and trying to establish a High Court on Corruption, which they put in place September 5, 2019. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the early days of the new administration, but by mid August there was clear evidence of actual change in a country that desperately needed a new direction from its corrupt past.&nbsp;  President Trump&#8217;s Phone Call to President Zelensky  On July 25, when President Trump called President Zelensky, the President congratulated President Zelensky for the big win in Parliament and talked about &#8220;burden-sharing&#8221; (other nations also paying their share of support for Ukraine). The two presidents talked about their disapproval of the previous ambassadors to each other&#8217;s countries. But instead of following all the staff preparation notes written by Lt. Col Vindman, the National Security Council staffer assigned to Ukraine, and just talking about &#8220;corruption&#8221; in general, the President brought up a question about Ukraine and the 2016 election interference, which I will note below. President Zelensky also brought up to President Trump that his staff was planning to meet with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, in the coming days, which led to a conversation about Joe Biden and the firing of the previous prosecutor in Ukraine.&nbsp;  After the call, Lt. Col Vindman contacted an attorney at the National Security Council to express his &#8220;policy concerns&#8221; about the call. It is interesting to note that Lt. Col. Vindman&#8217;s boss, Tim Morrison, was also on the call, but he did not see any problems or concerns with the call according to his own testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. Within a month a whistleblower filed a report about the call, saying he heard about the call second-hand and was concerned about the implications of a conversation about elections on a head-of-state call. To keep the July 25th call in context with other news, the day before it took place&#8212;July 24&#8212;Robert Mueller had testified before Congress as the last official act to close down the two-and-a-half-year Mueller investigation and clear the President and his campaign team of any further accusation of election interference.&nbsp;  During the impeachment trial in the Senate, the House Managers repeated over and over that the President was planning to cheat &#8220;again&#8221; on the next election, but the final conclusion of the Mueller Report was &#8220;ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the (Trump) Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.&#8221;&nbsp;  This is especially notable, because for years a rumor circulated that Ukraine was part of the 2016 election interference and that someone in Ukraine was hiding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server that was hacked by the Russians in 2016. As the conspiracy theory goes, it was actually the Ukrainians that hacked the DNC, not the Russians. This is the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory that President Trump asked President Zelensky to help solve during the call.&nbsp;  Agencies of the US Intelligence Community have stated over and over that they did not believe that Ukraine was involved in the Russian election interference from 2016. I personally agree with the Intelligence Community assessment. But Rudy Giuliani, and multiple others around President Trump believed there was a secret plan in 2016 to hurt President Trump&#8217;s election from Ukraine. This accusation was amplified by bits of truth, including that the Ukrainian Ambassador to the US wrote an editorial in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 right before the election, and several other Ukrainian officials publicly spoke out against candidate Trump in 2016.&nbsp;  There is nothing illegal about a foreign nation speaking out for or against a presidential candidate, whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in 2016, or anyone else in the future. It may not be wise to take sides before an election, but it is not illegal. Just because some Ukrainian officials took sides, does not mean that the whole Ukrainian government worked on a cyberattack on our elections. But since this rumor had persisted, and it was a new administration now in Ukraine, President Trump asked President Zelensky to help clear up the facts if he could. That is certainly not illegal or improper, and it is certainly not something that could help the President in the 2020 election, especially since the 2016 Russian election accusation had just been closed the day before.&nbsp; &nbsp; The 2016 &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory is the issue that President Trump asked President Zelensky to &#8220;do us a favor&#8221; about, not the Biden&#8217;s or Burisma. During the July 25 call after the question about &#8220;Crowdstrike,&#8221; President Zelensky mentioned to President Trump that one of his advisers would be meeting with Rudy Giuliani soon. Then, President Trump affirmed that meeting and encouraged them to talk about the Biden investigation and the firing of the Ukrainian Prosecutor.&nbsp;  That may seem out of the blue, but in Washington, DC, that week, the city was buzzing about a Washington Post article that had been written three days before (July 22, 2019) detailing Hunter Biden&#8217;s giant salary ($83,000 per month) for doing essentially nothing for a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company and how it undercut Vice President Biden&#8217;s message on corruption.&nbsp;  It is important to get the context of that week to understand the context of the phone call that day. I have no doubt that the story was just as big of news in Kiev, Ukraine as it was in Washington, DC, that week. President Trump&#8217;s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had been in and out of Ukraine since November 2018, meeting with government officials and trying to find out more about the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory or any other Ukrainian connection to the 2016 election. During that time Rudy Giuliani met several former prosecutors from Ukraine who blamed their departure on Vice President Biden. It is clear that Rudy Giuliani was working to gain information about both of these issues in his capacity as President Trump&#8217;s private attorney.&nbsp;  It is not criminal for Rudy Giuliani to work on opposition research for a presidential campaign or to work on behalf of his client to clear his name from any issues related to the 2016 campaign, which he had done since November 2018. Some have stated that since this was &#8220;foreign information,&#8221; it is illegal. That is absolutely not true. In fact, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee in 2016 paid a British citizen, Christopher Steele, to work his contacts in Russia to create the now debunked &#8220;Steele Dossier&#8221; which the FBI used to open its investigation into President Trump, leading directly to the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller. That &#8220;Dossier&#8221; was opposition research done in Russia by a British citizen, paid for by the Clinton campaign team. Their opposition research was not illegal, but the use and abuse of that document by the FBI to start an investigation was certainly inappropriate and is most likely illegal. But, the FBI warrant issue is still being investigated by the ongoing Durham probe.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, when President Zelensky brought up the issue of Rudy Giuliani and President Trump replied to his statement. You can argue that President Trump should not have discussed the issue with President Zelensky when he brought it up, but it is certainly not illegal or impeachable to talk about it, especially when there are serious questions about Hunter Biden&#8217;s work with Burisma. That is not a conservative conspiracy theory; the issue of Hunter Biden&#8217;s employment in Ukraine was a problem for years at the State Department. It had been raised to Vice President Biden when he was still in office. Every State Department official interviewed for the Trump impeachment investigation noted that at best it was a clear conflict of interest and it was the center of a huge story on corruption in the Washington Post on July 22, 2019. It had the appearance of high-level corruption by using a well-placed family member on the board of a known corrupt gas company in Ukraine to shelter it from prosecutors. Hunter Biden had only resigned from the Burisma board a few months before the July 25 phone call, just prior to when his dad announced his run for the Presidency in 2019.&nbsp;  After the July 25 phone call, Attorney General Barr did not have any follow up meetings or calls with Ukrainian officials. Rudy Giuliani did have additional conversations with Ukrainian officials, which are legal to do since he is a private attorney representing the President.&nbsp;  Text of July 25, 2019 Phone Call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky:  The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.  President Zelensky: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.   The President: (laughter) That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.  President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.   The President: Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she &#183;doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.  President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.  The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.  President Zelensky: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.. That I can assure you.   The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.  President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.  The President: Well, she's going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.  President Zelensky: I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for your support.  The President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.  The President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. President.   The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.  President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.   &nbsp;  Based on a whistleblower report about the July 25 call, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the report on September 13 and started its impeachment inquiry on September 24.&nbsp;  Senate Trial  House Managers&#8217; Case for Impeachment&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, House Managers stated their belief that the President had carried out a &#8220;scheme to cheat in the 2020 election&#8221; by withholding financial aid to Ukraine and withholding a White House meeting with the new President of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine announcing it would investigate Joe Biden, Burisma, and 2016 election interference.  Let's discuss the facts of both.&nbsp;  White House Meeting&nbsp;  There is no question that President Trump had offered a White House meeting to President Zelensky three times: once in May on a phone call after President Zelensky won his election, once in June in a letter, and finally in the July 25th call after President Zelensky&#8217;s party won the parliamentary elections. But Tim Morrison (a State Department official called as a witness by the House) also testified that they were working on heads-of-state meetings with twelve other heads of state during that same time period. Many nations were trying to line up meetings in the White House during the summer of 2019.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, President Zelensky offered to instead move their meeting from a White House meeting to a face-to-face meeting in Warsaw, Poland, when they would both be there on September 1, 2019. The Presidents agreed, and planning began on the meeting in August. By August 22, the meeting planning was in full swing as noted by emails in the House hearing&#8217;s evidence. However, Hurricane Dorian slammed into the US in the hours leading up to the September 1 meeting, causing a last-minute shift to the Vice President traveling to Poland so the President could stay in the US to monitor hurricane relief.&nbsp;  We know that Vice President Pence met face-to-face with President Zelensky, and they spoke about other nations paying their fair share to help Ukraine and the issue of corruption across Ukraine. We know from the preparation materials and the meeting notes themselves that during the meeting the Vice President did not bring up or discuss the issue of Burisma, Joe Biden, or any other campaign conversation with President Zelensky.&nbsp;  The White House found the next available time when President Trump and President Zelensky would both be in the same place at the same time to set up a face-to-face meeting: September 25 at the UN Assembly in New York. That meeting was set up, and it took place as scheduled.&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, the House managers maintained that only a White House meeting was sufficient and that it was being withheld, but the facts show that President Zelensky himself floated the idea of a meeting in Poland and that the meeting was not barred or withheld.&nbsp;  In the early months of President Zelensky&#8217;s term, there was a great deal of concern about him, his staff, and his plans because he was an unknown political figure. Until more was known about him, it was entirely appropriate to show caution in coordinating a meeting, but once his nationwide anti-corruption efforts began in August, it was clear that face-to-face meetings were planned and carried out.&nbsp;  There was no withholding of a face-to-face meeting with President Trump and President Zelensky. There cannot be a quid pro quo if the meeting was not withheld from Ukrainian officials.&nbsp;  Foreign Aid to Ukraine  The House Managers claimed that there was a secret plot to &#8220;extort&#8221; or &#8220;bribe&#8221; the leadership of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden in exchange for around $400 million of US aid. The aid was State Department and foreign military aid that had been provided for the past four years, since Ukraine had been in a war with Russia.&nbsp;  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its occupation of Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the US started sending aid to help the Ukrainian government. Congress allowed lethal and non-lethal aid to support Ukraine, but during the previous administration, only non-lethal aid was sent. Under President Trump&#8217;s administration, it was determined that the United States would give the leadership of Ukraine lethal aid to help them fight off Russian tanks, which was President Zelensky&#8217;s reference to &#8220;javelins&#8221; in the July 25th phone call and his gratitude to President Trump for allowing those tank killing rockets to flow to Ukraine.&nbsp;  To be clear, the theory of funds being withheld from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation does not originate from the July 25 call read out. There is nothing in the text of the call that threatens the withholding of funds in exchange for an investigation.&nbsp;  The theory originates from the fact that aid was held back by the Office of Management and Budget, headed by the President&#8217;s Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and the &#8220;presumption&#8221; of US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that the aid must have been held because of the President&#8217;s desire to get the Biden investigation done, since the President&#8217;s attorney, Rudy Giuliani was working to find out more about the Biden investigation.&nbsp;  Ambassador Sondland told multiple people about his theory, but when he finally called President Trump and asked him directly about it, the President responded that he did not have any quid pro quo, he just wanted the President of Ukraine to do what he ran on and &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221; Obviously, people who assume the worst about President Trump take this as a secret message that there actually was a quid pro quo, but the most important fact is that Ambassador Sondland did not read it that way after his call with the President. Ambassador Sondland believed that the President was serious. Unfortunately, the White House Counsel was never allowed to cross examine Ambassador Sondland during the House investigation to get the facts about who he talked to and why he came to believe for a while that there was an effort to push for investigations in exchange for money.&nbsp;  During the Senate trial, I listened closely to the facts surrounding the withholding of aid money to Ukraine. This was by far the most serious charge against the President. Two key questions had to be answered for me: why was the aid held, and why was the aid released. There was no question the aid was held for a couple of months. The question was why?&nbsp;  Statements from the House witnesses during the House impeachment inquiry answered the two key questions: the aid was held because there was a legitimate concern about the new President of Ukraine and his administration in the early days of his presidency and the aid was released on time when the new Ukrainian Parliament starting passing anti-corruption laws in August and after Vice President Pence sat down face to face with President Zelensky on September 1 in Poland to discuss their progress on corruption.&nbsp;  We should not lose track of what was happening in Ukraine in 2019. A new President was elected who was a TV actor with no political experience and no record on how he would handle Russia or the issue of widespread national corruption in Ukraine. He ran on a platform of anti-corruption at all levels, but no one knew how he would govern. His campaign was funded by a Ukrainian oligarch who owned a major media outlet, and one of his first advisers was the former attorney for that oligarch.&nbsp;  I personally spoke to many of the State Department officials in Ukraine in May of 2019 and heard their concerns about the new government. Then, newly elected President Zelensky used his power to dissolve their Parliament the day he was sworn in and called for &#8220;snap elections&#8221; in which the vast majority of the newly elected leaders were from his newly formed party. To our State Department and the White House, this was either a really a good sign or a really bad sign. Either Ukraine was about to take a major change for the better with new leadership, or this new young leader was about to assume real centralized power. No one knew for certain in May, June, and July of 2019. Within a few weeks in August, the new Parliament got to work passing anti-corruption laws and making significant changes in their accountability and for the country. This was a very good sign.&nbsp;  When Vice President Pence met face to face with President Zelensky September 1, both sides had confidence the country was taking a new direction. On September 10 Vice President Pence and Senator Rob Portman met with President Trump to tell him about the progress that had been made, and both advised lifting the hold on aid. The aid was lifted the next day, September 11. No investigation into Hunter Biden or Burisma was ever done by Ukraine, and no part of the US Department of Justice was ever involved in any investigation of Hunter Biden or Burisma.&nbsp;  Though the aid was frozen in June, there was no public announcement of the hold, as explained by the White House Counsel, to keep this from becoming a public issue while the White House monitored the progress and status of the transition in Ukraine.&nbsp;  On August 27, Politico published an article that noted that the foreign aid had been held by the US. This caused President Zelensky&#8217;s office to reach out to the State Department and ask why. During the House impeachment proceedings, four of the House witnesses (Ambassador Voelker, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor, and Tim Morrison) all testified that the Ukrainian leadership learned about the temporary hold in aid after the Politico article was published.&nbsp;  The issue of the hold was also the first question from President Zelensky to Vice President Pence when they met September 1 in Poland. The idea that the leadership in Ukraine had pressure placed on them to do an investigation fails the most essential test, did the leadership of Ukraine even know that the aid was being held? The answer from multiple American and Ukrainian leaders was no, they did not know there was a hold on the aid from the White House. You cannot have pressure to act on an investigation, if they did not even know the aid was being held.&nbsp;  It is interesting to note, when I researched the records of past foreign aid payment dates and times to Ukraine, I found the 2019 aid was in line with the date the 2016, 2017, and 2018 aid was sent. The vast majority of the military aid to Ukraine was obligated in August or September for the past four years. Though the aid was ready to go out the door a couple months earlier in 2019, it was certainly not late, based on the record of the previous three years. In fact, the State Department aid was obligated September 30 in 2019, but it was obligated September 28 in 2018. As quoted by the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, &#8220;the aid was held such a short time, we did not even notice.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the two days of question-and-answer time, I asked a specific question related to this issue because I felt it was important to get the context of the aid, since there had been so much made of the issue during the trial. Here is the full text of my question to the White House Counsel:&nbsp; House Managers have described any delay in military aid and state department funds to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in September and in 2017, 73% of the funds were obligated in September. In the State Department, the funds were obligated September 30 in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 in 2018. Each year, the vast majority of the funds were obligated in the final month or days of the fiscal year. Question: Was there a national security risk to Ukraine or the United States from the funds going out late in September in the two previous years? Did it weaken our relationship with Ukraine because the vast majority of our aid was released in September each of the last three years?&nbsp;  In response to my question, White House Counsel detailed the fact that military aid from the US was not for immediate use. It was designed to help the Ukrainian military buy materials for the next year, so it was common for the aid to be obligated at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), and it was also common for some money to be left unobligated and carried over into the next fiscal year, as it was in 2019.&nbsp;  While it is easy to create an intricate story on the hold placed on foreign aid to Ukraine, it is also clear that President Trump has temporarily held foreign aid from multiple countries over the past two years, including: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Lebanon, and others. There is no question that a President can withhold aid for a short period of time, but it must be released by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, which it was in this instance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Constitutional Issues Around This Impeachment  Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants the US House of Representatives &#8220;the sole power of impeachment,&#8221; while Article I, Section 3 states that &#8220;the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.&#8221;&nbsp;  The Constitution is clear that the House does not control the Senate process and the Senate does not control the House process. However, during the impeachment trial of President Trump, the House tried repeatedly to dictate to the Senate how it should conduct its trial.&nbsp;  The &#8220;sole power to try&#8221; means laying out rules for the trial, including when and if to call additional witnesses or request more documents.&nbsp;  In addition to laying out roles and responsibilities for impeachment, our Constitution also provides basic rights for the accused. The Fifth Amendment ensures due process. However, the receipt of due process is not contingent upon waiving another right, like immunity or executive privilege. But that is exactly what the House tried to force President Trump to do.&nbsp;  The President is not above the law, but neither is the House of Representatives. If there was a question as to the scope and proper use of the President&#8217;s right to assert immunity or executive privilege regarding conversations he had with his closest advisers, that question is proper for a court to determine, not Congress, and surely not the House on its own accord. To put this in constitutional terms, the Legislative Branch cannot prevent the Executive Branch from having access to the Judicial Branch. The House wanted to move quickly and prevent the President from ever going to court to resolve any issue. That has never been done for a good reason, the separation of powers. In previous legal battles with the President, it has taken months to resolve critical issues, like Bush v. Gore in 2000 or even in the Clinton impeachment trial, when the House took two months to resolve an issue with witnesses in court. It does not have to drag on for years.&nbsp;  The House also wanted the Chief Justice of the United States to &#8220;rule on&#8221; any issue quickly, instead of allowing the President to go through the courts. This would have created a new judicial executive branch by putting all the judicial power of the nation in one person, not in the Judicial Branch, as is stated in the Constitution. It would have also ignored the text of the Constitution where it notes that the Chief Justice &#8220;presides&#8221; in the court of impeachment, not &#8220;decides.&#8221; The sole power of impeachment is in the Senate, not the Senate, plus the one Justice. The Chief Justice keeps the trial moving along, based on the rules of the trial, but he or she is not a decider of fact, that is reserved to the Senate. The House Managers wanted to ignore that part of the Constitution to move the trial faster for expedience. We cannot ignore the Constitution or create bad precedent, no matter which party is being tried for impeachment.&nbsp;  Further, the Sixth Amendment guarantees that the accused has the ability to both confront the witnesses against him and to have the assistance of counsel. The majority of the impeachment inquiry in the House was done without a meaningful opportunity for the president to participate and administration witnesses were denied the ability to have counsel present for depositions.&nbsp;  The Constitution lays out a clear separation of powers, but importantly also provides a system of checks and balances. For something as important as impeachment, it is imperative that the process be one that is squarely within the bounds of the Constitution and is one that the American people can trust. Unfortunately, the process undertaken by the House to impeach President Trump falls wildly short of the standards put in place by our Founders.&nbsp;  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that &#8220;the President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the trial of President Trump, there was a lot of conversation about what constitutes a &#8220;high crime&#8221; or &#8220;misdemeanor.&#8221; Notably, the House did not charge the President with any crimes. Rather, the House chose to impeach the President for &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; and &#8220;obstruction of Congress.&#8221;&nbsp;  The House theoretically could have chosen to file articles of impeachment for crimes such as bribery, extortion, solicitation of interference in an election, or violations of the Impoundments Clause Act. For any of these crimes, the House would have had to prove specific elements of each. Since they couldn&#8217;t prove any of those crimes, they chose to charge the President with &#8220;abuse of power.&#8221; As was noted in the trial, forty Presidents have faced accusation of &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; going back as far as George Washington.&nbsp;  The abuse of power charge for President Trump was based on allegations that he improperly withheld aid to Ukraine and conditioned a meeting with President Zelensky at the White House in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Over the course of the last four months, we heard the term quid pro quo used over and over again but the facts do not show criminal quid pro quo. As previously mentioned, President Zelensky asked to meet with President Trump in Poland and that meeting was set up. Further, while the aid to Ukraine was delayed, it wasn&#8217;t delayed more than it had been the previous two years, and the aid was released without an investigation (or even an announcement of one) into the Biden&#8217;s.&nbsp;  The second article of impeachment, Obstruction of Congress, had an even weaker constitutional foundation. The investigation was announced September 24, but did not officially begin until October 31. The impeachment vote in the House was December 18. This very short time table and the accusation that the President refused to follow the law, honor the courts and that he acted like a &#8220;King&#8221; did not meet even the most basic constitutional standards for justice.&nbsp;  For example, during the Mueller investigation, the President&#8217;s team fully cooperated with the investigation that included over 2,000 subpoenas and 500 witnesses, including the President&#8217;s Chief of Staff, multiple cabinet officials and many lower-level officials that were all made available. It was clear throughout the investigation that the President did not like or agree with the Mueller investigation, but he also fully cooperated with every subpoena, each witness and every document. In fact, they released over a million pages of documents to the Mueller team.&nbsp;  President Trump also made his disagreement with the courts very clear on issues like the census, whether travel restrictions can be put in place to ensure national security, or whether particular funds can be used to secure our southern border. But, each time the President lost in court, his Administration complied with orders from the Judiciary. That is how our system of government is supposed to work.&nbsp;  When disagreements happen between the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch, they usually lead to resolution, not impeachment. The Fast and Furious investigation, which lasted more than three years in the Obama Administration, led to a vote in the House to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, but it never led to an impeachment inquiry, even though there was a clear and consistent refusal to cooperate with Congress or turn over key documents for three years.&nbsp;  In this case the accusation that President Trump ignored subpoenas or refused to follow the law is not correct. The President&#8217;s team made it very clear that they would cooperate during the impeachment inquiry with properly authorized and issued subpoenas, but the House refused to issue subpoenas that were consistent with the law to seek resolution for documents and witnesses. The House was focused on speed, not legal process.&nbsp;  The House, in a rush to impeachment last fall, issued multiple subpoenas for documents and testimony before the House had given authority to the committees to issue subpoenas for an impeachment inquiry, which happened October 31. Since there was no authority to issue the subpoenas, they were not duly authorized. The House also demanded testimony from the President&#8217;s inner circle without working through the legal questions and the House demanded Executive Agency witnesses appear without allowing them to bring Agency counsel with them. All of those issues created very real legal and constitutional problems. Agency individuals have always been allowed to have legal counsel with them when they are deposed, except this time.&nbsp;  As a Member of Congress, I cannot demand the President turn over documents or give testimony in any fashion that I would prefer, just because I have oversight responsibilities. In the same way, the President or other Executive Branch officials cannot demand I turn over my notes or provide my staff for testimony without going through the courts and gaining a legal subpoena. Congress has vigorously and rightfully protected its rights from unwarranted investigations from any president. And presidents have done the same. But in all cases, the law must be followed and the proper process must be pursued to get the information in a legal way.&nbsp;  Additional Witnesses  From the very first moments of the Senate trial, the House Managers fought for additional witnesses and documents from the President. Their argument, and justification for the second article of impeachment, centered on the White House&#8217;s refusal to turn over documents and make every witness available without going through the normal legal process.&nbsp;  Per the resolution adopted by the Senate, the House record was part of the trial record. The Senate had the testimony of the witnesses the House chose to question as part of the overall information of the trial. The House already had 28,000 pages of documents that were part of the evidence they submitted to the Senate. Although, the House Managers admitted during the Senate impeachment trial that they still have not released all of the documents and witness testimony that they had gathered in their investigation to the White House Counsel or to the Senate. We do not fully know why the House held back some of its witness testimony and released others.&nbsp;  The House witness testimony was used extensively in the Senate trial.  Witnesses who testified live or via video in the House and Senate Impeachment:&nbsp;  David Holmes, Political Counselor, US Embassy Ukraine, State Department&nbsp; Dr. Fiona Hill, White House Adviser, National Security Council David Hale, Undersecretary for Political Affairs, State Department&nbsp; Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense&nbsp; Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union&nbsp; Tim Morison, Former White House Advisor&nbsp; Kurt Voelker, Former Special Envoy for Ukraine&nbsp; Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, National Security Council&nbsp; Jennifer Williams, Aide to the Vice President&nbsp; Marie Yovanovitch, Former Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp; George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State&nbsp; Bill Taylor, Former United States Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp;  The House Managers repeated over and over that additional witnesses would only take a week to depose, which is a clearly false statement. New witnesses took longer than a week to depose in the House inquiry, clearly it would take just as long or longer in a Senate trial. The remaining &#8220;wish list&#8221; of witnesses all had clear issues that needed to be resolved in the courts, which would take a couple of months to resolve, which is why the House Managers did not push for their testimony in the House impeachment process, they valued speed more than legal process.&nbsp;  House Managers repeatedly stated that witnesses only took a week to depose in the Clinton Senate impeachment trial, but they know that during the Clinton Senate trial all three called witnesses previously deposed in the House inquiry or in the Grand Jury investigation and all issues of Executive privilege had already been decided through the courts. There were no new witnesses in the Senate trial of President Clinton. Also, the Clinton White House had already had the opportunity to cross examine witnesses or the investigators in the Clinton impeachment inquiry; this time the Trump White House had been denied that right. So, if new witnesses would be added for the Senate trial, the White House should have the right to also cross examine the previous House witnesses that they had been denied the right to cross examine in the past. This would all take much longer than a week and the House Managers knew that.&nbsp;  During the Clinton Impeachment trial in the Senate, there were no additional documents requested, only previously deposed witnesses. The House Managers did not go through the legal process to get documents, like the Mueller investigation had done, so all of the new document requests from the House Managers would take at least three to five weeks to complete, once a legal subpoena is delivered. It takes time to search all databases, review the documents for classified materials, determine any legal issues, and release them to the investigation. Once the documents are turned over, both legal teams need time to review the documents. Again, the House Managers knew these facts, but they continued to repeat over and over that it would only take a week to get all the documents.&nbsp;  The first question for the Senate trial was: do we have enough evidence and testimony to answer the questions the House presented in their articles of impeachment? If the answer is yes, then we do not need additional witnesses or documents. If the answer is no, then we do need additional information. There were many leaks and newspaper stories during the trial designed to push the Senate to vote to ask for more testimony, but that did not change the primary question. We already knew from evidence that there was no quid pro quo, no Ukrainian investigations and no withholding of a public meeting with President Trump.&nbsp;  The New York Times story on January 26 and again on January 31 are clear examples of an attempt to bring doubt on the information and witness testimony. Both stories stated that someone had read the pending John Bolton book manuscript and that in the book Bolton stated that President Trump had talked about investigations in exchange for aid funding for Ukraine. The New York Times also wrote that the book would state that Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, were also a part of the scheme. I looked at both stories closely and noticed that the reporters had not read the manuscripts or quoted the manuscripts; they were reports from someone who stated that they had read the manuscripts. Both stories took significant liberties to describe the intent in the manuscripts, but the reporter had apparently also not spoken to John Bolton.&nbsp;  On January 23, 2020, the National Security Council lawyers sent a letter to the legal team handling the book publishing for John Bolton to inform him that the manuscript contained some classified information and it would need have some edits before publication in March. Then, on January 26, the New York Times published a story that someone had leaked some of the details of the book, but they had not released the actual manuscript. While I am interested in seeing the actual manuscript, I am also very aware that this selective leak was designed by The&nbsp;New York Times and whoever leaked the information to influence the ongoing trial.&nbsp;  It was clear from the earliest days of the trial that the House had a clear political strategy as well as a court-room strategy. During the trial I had the responsibility to hear the facts but also to separate the politics from the facts. Politically, it was best for the House to move as quickly as possible through impeachment so that vulnerable Democratic members could vote for impeachment, and then move quickly to other topics. But since the presidential election is in full swing, it was politically better for Democrats to make the Senate trial move as slow as possible to hurt the President during the campaign. That explains why the House did not take the time to formally request documents or testimony from many individuals; they needed to move fast and try to force the Senate to move slowly. It also explained why the House passed impeachment on a party line vote, then held the articles of impeachment for a month before delivering them to the Senate to start the trial. The House Managers said repeatedly that the evidence was clear and that they had proved their case. But, if that was true, why would the Senate need to call additional witnesses? I think the reason is that the witness process was about delay, more than facts.&nbsp;  Final Thoughts  The facts do not support the accusation in the Trump impeachment, and it certainly did not need to come to this moment of national division. While, it was clear that the House Managers wanted to drag the trial on for months in the Senate, through the primary election season, their case consisted of hypothetical story lines and &#8220;presumptions&#8221; more than facts that warrant the removal of a President. This does not meet what Alexander Hamilton in Federalist, No. 65 described as the &#8220;due weight&#8221; for the arguments.&nbsp;  But impeachment has certainly created the division in our society that Alexander Hamilton predicted. Over 200 years ago he wrote, &#8220;The prosecution [of impeachments], will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.&#8221; This has been an incredibly divisive season in our nation. It is not about one person, it is about all of us. We individually choose how we handle disagreements with family, friends, and people on the other side of particular issues. Our government represents us, so it is up to us to model for our government how to handle disagreements.&nbsp;  We are now past impeachment, and it's time to work on the issues that matter most to the American people. As we move forward, every American should speak out on the issues that are important to them and the voices that speak for their point of view. But, we should remember that we have much more in common than we have that divides us. It is my hope that our nation does not go through a season like this again for a very long time and that we can move past this age of impeachment to an age of oversight and accountability.&nbsp;  I appreciate all the engagement with our office during the impeachment proceedings. We had thousands of calls and emails over the past month. We had hundreds of thousands of views on the nightly Facebook Live updates each day during the trial. While not every Oklahoman agrees with every decision I make on behalf of our state, I am grateful most choose to be respectful in expressing their points of view. At the end of the day, we are Oklahomans. We may not all agree on each issue, but we can be respectful of each other in our disagreement.&nbsp;  I am honored to serve our state and nation. We have many important issues to address in the coming days, I pray we can work on them together for the future of our state and nation.

Discrimination Against Older Americans&nbsp;  A 2018 study by AARP found that three out of five workers over the age of 44 had witnessed or experienced age discrimination in the workplace.  The Protecting Older Workers from Discrimination Act (H.R. 1230) would restore the workplace protections for older workers that were weakened by the Supreme Court&#8217;s 2009 decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., which required individuals to prove that age discrimination was the sole motivating factor for the employer&#8217;s action against an older worker. The Protecting Older Workers from Discrimination Act would restore the pre-2009 standard, which only required proof that age discrimination was a motivating factor for an unlawful employment practice,&nbsp;regardless of whether&nbsp;other factors influenced the employer&#8217;s decision. Consequently, I voted in favor of the Protecting Older Americans Against Discrimination Act when it was approved by the House on January 15 by a vote of 261 to 155.  Suicide Prevention  Suicide is a serious problem facing our nation &#8211; it&#8217;s the tenth leading cause of death, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Each year, there are more than a million suicide attempts in the U.S. &#8211; and roughly 50,000 suicide deaths. I believe more must be done to prevent suicide; consequently, I joined an overwhelming majority of my colleagues in the House in voting to approve H.R. 4704, the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act, on January 27 by a vote of 385-8. This bill directs the National Science Foundation to award competitive, merit-reviewed grants&nbsp;for research on the factors behind suicide attempts, as well as effective measures for suicide prevention and treatment.

This bill would reform the U.S. credit reporting system &#8211; giving consumers more power and more control over their credit information.

Facebook (Twitter (YouTube (Website (Friends, It was a historic week in Washington D.C. which included the Senate putting an end to the Democrats' impeachment sham, the President delivering an inspiring State of the Union address, and a January jobs report that blew estimates out of the water with 225,000 jobs added in the first month of 2020. On Tuesday, President Trump's State of the Union address championed the \"Great American Comeback,\" a bold and hopeful vision for the future of our nation. House Republicans have successfully worked with the Trump Administration to deliver a new era of American strength and prosperity. The President highlighted the historically strong economy that is benefiting families in Wyoming and across the country: * 3.5% unemployment rate, the lowest in 50 years * U.S. consumer confidence at highest levels since 2000 * Highest level of entrepreneurial activity recorded in the last two decades * Median household family incomes grown by nearly 8 percent under President Trump Additionally, the President reaffirmed his commitment to Americas military and our leadership around the world. The guests he invited, stories he told, and policies he outlined reminded us of all that is best about America. Click on the video below to watch my interview with Fox Business previewing the State of the Union address. In stark contrast, Democrats' response to the positive vision outlined by President Trump in the State of the Union was disgraceful, but unsurprising. Between their members staging an episode of political theater by walking (out (, to refusing to applaud common-sense accomplishments (like awarding scholarships to students that need them or lowering unemployment rates for disabled veterans, they showed their true colors. At the conclusion of the speech, Speaker Pelosi had a tantrum, disgraced herself, and dishonored the House by ripping up a copy of President Trump's speech (. She is an embarrassment and should apologize to the American people for her behavior. On Wednesday morning, I joined Wyomings Lets Talk With Al Harris (on KUGR 1490 AM to recap the State of the Union Address. We touched on the inspiring stories of the Presidents guests including a Tuskegee Airman, a young girl receiving a scholarship for school, and a soldier returning home to his family. We also discussed how the President has successfully rebuilt our military and enhanced our national security by taking out terrorist leaders Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Qassem Soleimoni. Click below to listen to the full interview. Rep. Liz Cheney Joins Let's Talk With Al Harris | February 5, 2020 On Wednesday, Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, did the right thing in voting to acquit President Trump of the Democrats' articles of impeachment. This effort was political from day one and Democrats' goal to impeach the President began the day he was inaugurated. When House Democrats launched their formal impeachment inquiry, they completely denied due process or fairness. Democrats then rushed the process, putting their political timeline before any legitimate search for truth or the facts. Throughout the process, Democrats ground all of the nations business to a halt, preventing Congress from focusing on the issues that matter to the American people because of this partisan impeachment. The country will hold Democrat leaders accountable for abandoning the Constitution and abdicating their oaths of office. Democrats proved that they cannot be trusted to put their responsibility to the country before their political self-interest, and that is something the American people will long remember. As a member of the House leadership team, I was proud to help lead the fight against the impeachment sham and uphold our Constitution. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Interior announced (it would provide nearly $36 million to Wyoming this year in Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation grants, to clean up and repurpose abandoned coal mines. As the nations leading coal producer and largest contributor to the AML fund, Wyomings coal communities rightly deserve these critical resources. These grants, which I have fought hard to protect, support investment in reclamation projects and leading-edge technologies like carbon capture. These hard-earned funds will create new economic opportunities while enhancing Wyoming's land and water resources. Congresswoman Liz Cheney ** Natural Resources Committee ------------------------------------------------------------ * The Western Caucus recently announced that my legislation (, the Increasing Access and Multiple Use Act, will be part of a package of bills (aimed at modernizing the Endanger Species Act (ESA). My provision would provide certainty for permit and leaseholders on public lands. Livestock producers have long battled against the federal governments attempts to reduce grazing on public lands. My bill is crucial to safeguarding ranchers, who legally graze on federal lands, from frivolous lawsuits that force them off their allotments, leaving them no choice other than to sell their livestock at fire-sale prices and subjecting them to economic ruin. My proposal ensures they will be able to continue to graze on public lands as they have for generations and it fulfills the intended mission of the multiple-use doctrine by protecting the interests of stakeholders in Wyoming. These reforms, in addition to the other pieces of legislation included in this package, are key to modernizing the ESA and bringing it into the 21st century. * Earlier this month, I introduced the Creating Opportunities And Leveraging Technologies for Coal Carbon Act ((COAL TeCC), legislation to establish a carbon technologies program at the Department of Energy (DOE) to advance research for coal-driven carbon products. As the nations largest coal-producing state, the people of Wyoming know that coal is more than just a critical energy source. New technologies have opened up unlimited applications for coal as a carbon-based product used in automobile frames, airplanes, electronic devices, and plastics. The unique composition of coal has the potential to create stronger, lighter, and less expensive carbon-based materials, providing coal communities in Wyoming with an important source of jobs and revenue. Investing in carbon-based technology and research strengthens the reality of coal as one of Americas most versatile and valuable natural resources. ** Armed Services Committee ------------------------------------------------------------ * On Monday, I joined Congressman Michael McCaul, the lead Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to introduce a resolution denouncing the United Kingdoms decision (to allow Huawei to build part of their 5G networks. I've been a leading voice (in fighting back against the Chinese Communist Party-controlled telecommunications companys attempts to infiltrate and spy on Americas allies. Allowing Huawei into the U.K.s 5G networks would pose a national security threat that could not be mitigated or contained. I've also joined my colleague, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, i (n introducing a bill (that would bar the U.S. from sharing intelligence with any country that allows Huawei into its 5G networks. * Last week, President Trump outlined his vision (to help create peace, prosperity, and a brighter future for Israel and the Palestinian people. The plan put forward by the President is a historic step towards bringing peace, security, and prosperity to a region that has long endured conflict and turmoil. President Trumps plan re-affirms Americas unwavering commitment to the security and survival of the state of Israel and establishes a path forward for the Palestinian people to turn away from terrorism and embrace a future of freedom and prosperity. I applaud the President and his team for their commitment to working with our allies to bring peace, security, and prosperity to a troubled region.

President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address &#8212; an uplifting celebration of the diversity of the American experience and the triumph of the American spirit. The terrorist leader of al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula, who claimed to have orchestrated the NAS Pensacola shooting, has been eliminated.  Finally, and at long last, the sham impeachment trial has come to an end, and President Trump has been acquitted. Now that impeachment is finally over, will House Democrats get back to work for the American people? (The answer, unfortunately, seems to be&nbsp;&#8220;no.&#8221;)    TERRORIST KILLED On Sunday, Qasim al-Rimi, a cofounder of al-Qa&#8217;ida in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola in December.  On Thursday, February 6, the White House announced that Qasim al-Rimi was dead. On behalf of the thousands of patriots in Northwest Florida, I thank President Trump for his swift action in eliminating this brutal terrorist.&nbsp;  During his State of the Union address, the President stated that any assault on our freedom would be met with overwhelming, disproportionate retribution. He has kept his word. We are a safer, stronger nation tonight because of his leadership. &nbsp;  STATE OF THE UNION On the night of Tuesday, February 4, the President delivered his third State of the Union address. President Trump opened up his speech by declaring that &#8220;the state of our union is stronger than ever before.&#8221; He&#8217;s right. Wages are growing to new highs, the economy is soaring, and unemployment is at a 50-year low. Our nation has prospered greatly since President Trump took office, and his policies have led to success for ALL Americans.  The President&#8217;s remarks were uplifting and triumphant. It was a moving address, and well worth watching. Unfortunately, the conclusion of the speech was overshadowed by a political stunt from Speaker Pelosi.  &nbsp;  PELOSI&#8217;S DISGRACE At the conclusion of the President&#8217;s State of the Union address, while he received thunderous applause and a standing ovation, the Speaker took her copy of his prepared remarks and tore them in half. It is hard to overlook the symbolism of such a gesture &#8212; the sense that Speaker Pelosi was utterly dismissive of the President&#8217;s achievements and guests, and, more importantly, the achievements and success of the American people.  Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s gesture reflects poorly on her Speakership, and on the House of Representatives as a whole. The Speaker should not let her personal feelings about the President color her behavior as a leader in the United States Congress. This behavior is utterly unbecoming of the Speaker of the House.  I have sent a letter to the House Committee on Ethics, asking that they investigate the matter, and recommending that they censure the Speaker.  Tearing up this document was certainly distasteful &#8212; and was likely illegal, too. A section of federal law () states that &#8220;Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys [&#8230;] any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office [&#8230;] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.&#8221; Unlike the copies of the State of the Union address available elsewhere, Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s was an original, hand-signed copy. During State of the Union addresses, the President hand-delivers a copy of his remarks to the Speaker of the House, and to the President of the Senate (the Vice President). Those two copies are the &#8216;original&#8217; documents, from which all subsequent copies are made. They are not the &#8220;personal property&#8221; of the recipients. They are the property of Congress.  There is no question whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi &#8220;mutilated, obliterated, or destroyed&#8221; the copy of the President&#8217;s address provided to her at the beginning of the evening. The video evidence is clear and abundant; the Speaker herself gleefully acknowledged her actions. The Speaker cannot be above the law.  On Thursday night, I joined Laura Ingraham to discuss my letter to the Committee on Ethics. Watch it here:        Click to play!    &nbsp;  PRESIDENT ACQUITTED Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced an impeachment inquiry five months ago, but the &#8216;impeachment investigation&#8217; really began many months before that. For nearly a year, Democrats have been wasting Congress&#8217;s time, energy, and resources &#8212; with little to show for their efforts except heartburn.  If impeachment had not consumed Democrats&#8217; every waking moment, we could have had many bipartisan successes &#8212; from lowering prescription drug prices to rebuilding America&#8217;s infrastructure.  Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t been the case. My Republican colleagues and I have been preaching that this was a political stunt since the beginning &#8212; and on Wednesday, February 5, we were proved right, when the Senate concluded its impeachment trial and voted to acquit the President on both of the baseless charges levied against him. Of the 248 Republican members of the House and Senate, only one voted to convict the President. Mitt Romney chose pettiness and jealousy over objectivity.  We saw extreme moderates such as Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins vote to exonerate the President. This illustrates with clarity that this impeachment was purely political, and Romney&#8217;s vote was borne of bitterness, not principle. I am glad to put this national nightmare behind us, and hope that Congress will finally get back to working to help the American people.  &nbsp;  AROUND THE DISTRICT CHILDCARE FOR OUR HEROES The military families in our district sacrifice a great deal for America. But one sacrifice they should not have to make is childcare. Many military parents must drive to Eglin Air Force Base for childcare, which can add hours onto their daily commute.  Our military personnel protect our families, and we must return the favor. Not only does a lengthy and difficult commute hurt our military families, it also impacts our military readiness. The intense nature of the Special Forces Group demands the complete attention of participants, and when our operators are thinking about the strain on their families at home, they are not focused on their mission. This week, I wrote a letter with Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to urge to Secretary McCarthy to address the lack of childcare facilities for the 7th&nbsp;Special Forces Group. I look forward to hearing from the Secretary and lightening the burden for Northwest Florida&#8217;s warfighters. Read the letter here:    &nbsp;  JOSEPH AINSWORTH ACT Military veterans are the heartbeat of Northwest Florida.  Under current law, veterans whose net worth exceeds a certain threshold are ineligible for pension benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) calculates a veterans&#8217; net worth by evaluating the sum of the veterans&#8217; assets, plus their annual income. If that value exceeds the limitation the VA has set, the veteran is not eligible to receive pension benefits. This week, I introduced the Joseph Ainsworth Act along with fellow Florida representatives Ross Spano and Darren Soto. This bill would eliminate the &#8216;Net Worth Limitation&#8217; for veterans over 99 years of age &#8212; allowing centenarian veterans to qualify for full pension benefits from the VA, regardless of their net worth. Eliminating this rule for our military heroes who have achieved such a milestone in their life will help alleviate the financial burdens they and their families frequently endure. Furthermore, it also helps show our nation&#8217;s gratitude for these veterans&#8217; devotion to America. It is my hope that First Lieutenant Joseph Ainsworth&#8217;s situation will be eradicated for future centenarian military veterans, and that his service to our country will be immortalized through this legislation. A copy of the Joseph Ainsworth Act is available HERE.  &nbsp;  VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT The military is not a feature of our district &#8212; it is the defining characteristic.  Northwest Florida has been built by the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect America, and our cherished American values: freedom, justice, and the rule of law. It&#8217;s easy to walk down the street and forget how lucky we are to live amongst heroes.  Since the Library of Congress started the Veteran&#8217;s History Project in 200, over 6,000 Floridians have submitted their stories, but I know there are more out there. This week, we continued our efforts to uncover more of these stories. I look forward to hearing more about the lives of the men and women who have made our country great.

In January, I introduced a bill to help combat greenhouse gas emissions in our power sector, sent a letter to Betsy DeVos to urge the U.S. Department of Education to issue federal guidance banning public schools&#8217; dangerous use of seclusion and restraint practices, honored Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a commemorative video, and held my first town hall of 2020 &#8211; my 23rd since taking office and this Saturday I&#8217;ll be holding a Town Hall in Algonquin. If you&#8217;re interested in attending, RSVP here:&nbsp; Rep. Casten Introduces the Energy PRICE Act to Ensure FERC is Doing Their Part to Fight Climate Change    To learn more about my Energy PRICE Act, click here.  I recently introduced the Energy PRICE Act, which would clarify that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the responsibility to ensure that public electric utilities take into account greenhouse gas emissions when setting their utility rates. This bill serves a critical and necessary function to remind FERC that they have an affirmative obligation to structure rules and markets to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders &#8211; consumers, investors, and the environment &#8211; are met. We cannot get to a zero-carbon economy under the current regulatory regime, and this bill is a critical and necessary step to achieve that goal.  Rep. Casten Urges Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to Ban Harmful Student Seclusion, Restraint Practices   To read my full letter to Secretary DeVos, click here.  When the Chicago Tribune released an investigative report on the horrific use of child seclusion and life-threatening restraints in schools, which are disproportionately used against children with disabilities, I knew these practices needed to end immediately. That&#8217;s why I led a letter, along with Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Tammy Duckworth, my Illinois House colleagues, and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley to the U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos demanding she issue guidance to end this practice that is endangering our children. The fact that only 5 states have acted to stop these practices is reprehensible. Every child should feel safe at school. I hope that Secretary DeVos will do the right thing and act quickly to ban these practices nationwide.  Rep. Casten Honors Dr. Martin Luther King with Commemorative Video    To watch my video in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., click the image above or click here.  This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I was proud to honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr &#8211; a man who dedicated his life to equality, to peace and to service. I am personally in awe of Dr. King&#8217;s wisdom and patience. The wisdom to recognize the power of non-violent protest, and the patience to maintain that strategy even as his friends and colleagues were being bludgeoned. Dr. King did not ask us to simply believe that the future would be better. He asked us to play an active role in the creation of that better tomorrow. I hope we all take his example as a call to our service not only on Martin Luther King Jr. Day but every day.  Rep. Casten Visits Local Metra Facility to Show Support For Cleaner, Better Public Transit    Recently, I stopped by Metra's facilities to learn about their work rehabilitating locomotives and railcars. In the past decade, they have successfully revitalized 214 passenger cars, extending their life by 10-14 years. It is great to see innovation that is both cost effective and reduces waste.  It is my honor to represent you in the 116th Congress. As your Representative, I work for you and want to hear your priorities and concerns.

Eight years ago, when I took my first oath of office in Congress, I swore to support and defend the US Constitution. I thought of that oath often as the House considered whether to impeach President Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;voted for impeachment&nbsp;because of the overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power by asking a foreign country to meddle in our election and then trying to cover up his wrongdoing by obstructing the House&#8217;s investigation. History will judge the Senate&#8217;s vote yesterday to acquit President Trump. As the House continues our work on behalf of the American people, we will build on the&nbsp;hundreds of bipartisan bills&nbsp;we have already passed&#8212;and&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;uphold our Constitutional duty&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a vigorous&nbsp;check on the Trump administration.     Join Me at a Town Hall Meeting in April Every year I hold town hall meetings around NW Oregon so I can hear firsthand from the people I&#8217;m honored to represent. My spring series of town hall meetings will include six events in April. Please join me! There will be additional details for&nbsp;each event on my website&nbsp;soon. All weekday events will be in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Vernonia &nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 6&nbsp;   Tigard &nbsp; Tuesday, April 7&nbsp;   Portland &nbsp; Saturday, April 11&nbsp;   Warrenton &nbsp; Monday, April 13&nbsp;   McMinnville &nbsp; Tuesday, April 14&nbsp;   Hillsboro &nbsp; Thursday, April 16&nbsp;       We All Need Health Care Access to&nbsp;health care is a human right, but far too often people in our community face communication, cultural, and financial barriers that prevent them from accessing care. That&#8217;s why I brought Serena Cruz, the Executive Director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation and an advocate for health care accessibility and immigrant rights,&nbsp;as&nbsp;my guest at the State of the Union address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center&nbsp;provides&nbsp;critical&nbsp;health care&nbsp;services&nbsp;and is named for a six-year-old daughter of migrant farm workers who died after a cut in her foot became infected. If she had been able to access health care, Virginia would have turned 51 years old&nbsp;last month. Today, Serena reports that the clinic is seeing pregnant women who are too afraid to seek the prenatal care they need because of the frequent attacks by&nbsp;President&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;and&nbsp;his administration on&nbsp;immigrants&nbsp;and&nbsp;people of color. We must stand up for all members of our community. In Congress, I am committed to stopping hateful policies and fighting for increased access to health care for all.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt Addressing the high cost of higher education is one of my priorities, and one of the reasons I entered public service. Students today face a very different reality than I did: I was able to work my way through community college, a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and a law degree with a manageable amount of debt. When I sent out a survey about student loans last fall, more than 700 people responded. They described their student debt as being stressful, burdensome, painful, and overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; To help these borrowers and others like them, I recently&nbsp;held a clinic on student loan debt&nbsp;with a national expert. There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to address crushing student debt, like making it easier for borrowers to access and stay in&nbsp;affordable&nbsp;repayment plans. The House Education &amp; Labor Committee included that provision and several others I drafted in the College Affordability Act. I hope the House will vote on this legislation soon to provide needed relief to students and borrowers.&nbsp;     At Home and at the Border,&nbsp; Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies Cause Harm I recently visited the Southern Border&nbsp;to investigate the Trump Administration&#8217;s Remain in Mexico policy, which has&nbsp;stranded tens of thousands of asylum-seekers&nbsp;in dirty and dangerous tent camps. In Matamoros, Mexico, I&nbsp;saw families and many children living in squalor, without running water or adequate food.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;no way to treat families&nbsp;who are coming to the United States to escape violence&nbsp;or persecution and who have the right to request asylum under international law.  When I returned home I met with nine asylum-seekers, including an unaccompanied child, who are participating in the legal asylum process. They told me about the dangers they fled and the hardship they have experienced here, all in the hope of making their case for asylum and building a better life in the United States of America.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too often this administration has attacked immigrants and fueled racism and xenophobia. In a roundtable discussion with&nbsp;a dozen local advocates, I heard about how fear and anxiety is clouding the lives of our immigrant neighbors, including&nbsp;Dreamers who have known no other home&nbsp;and now risk being deported.

Here are a few updates:  A Correct &#8212;and Long Overdue&#8212; Verdict Hours ago, after 134&nbsp;days, the Senate finally put to rest the Democrats' effort to remove President Trump from office and overturn the 2016 election.&nbsp; This impeachment process was nothing more than a massive, politically-driven exercise consuming taxpayer dollars and legislative bandwidth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the case have long been clear, and despite the Democrats' efforts to obscure the truth, President Trump has been acquitted of the charges brought forth via the two articles of impeachment.&nbsp;  There is talk of the House pursuing additional articles of impeachment; hopefully House Democrats don&#8217;t go this route. &nbsp;The country is divided enough already.&nbsp;  The State of the Union President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. The President's speech was a&nbsp;commitment to fulfilling his promises while also laying out a bold vision for the future. From rebuilding our military to negotiating stronger trade deals to cutting taxes to lifting millions off of welfare and into work to securing our nation&#8217;s border and re-asserting American leadership abroad, the President has delivered.  It was a strong call to action for Congress to work with him to build on the successes of the last three years to make our nation even more prosperous and secure.  Coronavirus Update Congress has been closely monitoring the latest developments regarding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.&nbsp; Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention briefed lawmakers this week and I'm confident that our public health professionals have the resources they need to contain the threat.  The CDC has made additional information about the Coronavirus, as well as information specific to travelers, available here.  Big Trade Win for N.C. Workers, Farmers Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the NAFTA re-write that is expected to generate thousands of jobs for North Carolina, open our agricultural products to new markets and keep our already-strong economy humming.&nbsp; I spoke last week to a group of North Carolina ag and forest experts on what this means for our economy.&nbsp; This is a big win for the President and for hardworking American families, and it's a sign that the President's trade policies are getting results for middle-class workers. Other Trade Deals on the Horizon With passage of USMCA behind us, here's a brief update of where we stand in other ongoing trade negotiations around the world:  European Union Negotiations with the E.U. are underway, and it seems that access to European markets for our agricultural products are a sticking point.&nbsp; However, Agriculture Secretary Purdue said last week that he anticipates seeing a US-EU deal announced in \"weeks, not months\". I expect wins for our farm families to be an important part of that deal. China The U.S. and China inked a \"Phase One\" trade deal earlier this month, which reduces some tariffs in exchange for Chinese promises to buy more of our goods, particularly from our ag sector. &nbsp;We will see what happens. &nbsp;The effects of the Coronavirus will certainly complicate this.&nbsp;  Japan The trade deal reached with Japan last year took effect on January 1st. While a limited trade deal, it did reduce tariffs on Japanese imports of American-made beef, pork, poultry and numerous other agricultural products including blueberries. U.K. With \"Brexit\" fully underway, US and UK negotiators have set an ambitious timeline to craft a new trade deal between our two nations by the end of the year. &nbsp;This has the potential to be huge for North Carolina generally and agriculture specifically.&nbsp; India Indications are strong that we are nearing finalization of a new U.S.-India trade deal that will expand access to India for our agricultural products and improve protections for our intellectual property.&nbsp;  Transportation/Infrastructure Update The Democrats this past week unveiled their list of infrastructure spending proposals. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I'm hopeful that the Democrats will reach across the aisle and work with us to craft an infrastructure package that members of both parties can support. On a related note, I joined colleagues to introduce the Resilient Highways Act, which will help states like North Carolina mitigate the risk of damage from extreme weather to our highway system.&nbsp; Investing in mitigation and prevention projects saves taxpayer dollars down the road when disasters strike.&nbsp; This bill will help states ensure we're not just repairing flood damage after the fact, but preparing our roads to withstand future extreme weather.&nbsp;  On the House Floor It was another less-than-productive two weeks on the House floor. &nbsp;One bill approved, under the guise of \"consumer protection\", would be a government takeover of consumer credit reporting.&nbsp; It would make lending riskier and credit harder for middle class families to obtain. Among the other bills we considered: yet another attempt to tie the hands of President Trump &#8212; or any future President &#8212;&nbsp;to protect America from threats like Iran.&nbsp; House Democrats voted to approve this measure using a parliamentary loophole that prevented Republicans from amending the measure. &nbsp;How?&nbsp; They took a non-controversial bill to mint a gold coin in honor of our Merchant Mariners and substituted the language. &nbsp;Thank goodness for the Republican-led U.S. Senate, which will ensure that none of these bills will go anywhere.&nbsp;  Sharing the Good Economic News In his speech Tuesday night, President Trump laid out the litany of good economic news we've witnessed since he took office. Congress' Joint Economic Committee regularly compiles the latest facts and figures on our strong economy. View their latest update here.  Addressing Our Spending Addiction It's not talked about much with so many other issues on the front-burner, but ending Washington's spending addiction and tackling our debt requires serious discussion and debate. &nbsp;The Congressional Budget Office announced just this week that if we don't take dramatic action, in the next 10 years federal debt held by the public will soar from 81 percent to 98 percent of GDP -- the highest level since just before World War II. This is why I joined several of my colleagues in the North Carolina Delegation to author a measure that expresses support for a balanced budget and urges Congress not to raise the debt ceiling without significant fiscal and spending reforms.&nbsp;  If Congress doesn&#8217;t get some guts and tackle the mandatory and entitlement spending that continues to drive the massive increases in debt, the consequences for future generations will be severe.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pleased to join my colleagues in sponsoring this resolution &#8212; a good first step towards the reforms necessary to save the country from fiscal disaster.

We fought to keep jobs in America by ensuring labor standards are enforced on our trade partners. We negotiated the removal of provisions that would have protected pharmaceutical companies at the expense of American patients.&nbsp;No less importantly, because of our efforts, environmental protections were significantly strengthened in the final deal. Once these changes were agreed upon,&nbsp;I was more comfortable voting to ratify the USMCA on December 19, 2019. The treaty passed the House by a vote of 385-41.&nbsp; Many adjustments were made to the deal since it was first presented to the House of Representatives. After tough negotiations, House Democrats were able to make the following changes for the American people:     Original USMCA Draft USMCA Updates Made by the House   Difficult to File Labor Violation Claims: The original draft set intentional procedural barriers that would make it harder for workers to prove labor violations affected trade and investment. The final version automatically assumes that labor violations affect trade and investment and will require the other governments to prove otherwise.&nbsp;   Weak Labor Monitoring: The original draft omitted resources and guidelines that would bolster the ability of the US to monitor strengthened labor provision enforcement in Mexico and Canada.&nbsp; The final USMCA deal provides the US with significant enforcement mechanisms, including:&nbsp;   Ongoing reporting requirements to Congress.   Labor attach&#233;s that will be based in Mexico to provide detailed regular information about Mexico&#8217;s labor practices.   Clearly defined benchmarks for Mexico&#8217;s labor reform implementation process. Any failure to comply with these benchmarks will lead to enforcement action under the agreement.   An interagency committee that will monitor Mexico&#8217;s labor reform implementation and compliance with labor obligations.     Difficult to File Environmental Violation Claims: The original draft set intentional procedural barriers that would make it harder for workers to prove environmental violations affected trade and investment. The final version automatically assumes that environmental violations affect trade and investment and will require the other government to prove otherwise.&nbsp;   Weak Environment Monitoring: The original draft omitted resources and guidelines that would bolster the ability of the US to ensure that Mexico and Canada were enforcing their environmental commitments.  The final USMCA deal provides the US with significant enforcement mechanisms, including:   Environment-focused attach&#233;s in Mexico City that will regularly monitor Mexico&#8217;s environment laws, regulations, and practices.   An interagency committee that will assess the current environmental landscape of Canada and Mexico and monitor their implementation of the environment obligations. This agency will also help the U.S. to coordinate and implement efforts to strengthen environment practices.     The original draft guaranteed 10 years of market exclusivity for biologic drugs, which would bar drug companies from manufacturing generic alternatives. This provision had the potential to drive up drug prices in Mexico and Canada, where shorter market exclusivity periods exist, and stand in the way of American efforts to lower drugs prices.  The final USMCA deal provides the US with significant wins geared towards lowering the price of prescription drugs, including:   Removal of the 10 year market exclusivity threshold. Revisions that make it easier for generic drug companies to obtain marketing approval on day one of a current drug&#8217;s patent expiration. Revisions that permit incentives for generic drug competition and improves transparency.      Please know that I will continue to closely monitor the implementation of this treaty and will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve the lives of people across Connecticut.&nbsp;  To keep up with my work in Congress, sign up for my e-newsletter here!

Don Beyer | February 4, 2020 When the president gives his State of the Union address this week, I expect him to demand credit for our strong economy. Doubtless, he will chalk it up to his supposed business acumen. History tells us much of what he says will be false or misleading. The president told a lie recently in a speech at Davos that we should expect to hear again: that the economy he inherited from Barack Obama was in dismal shape. He said that the current economy is booming due to his magic touchnot because Barack Obama helped dig us out from the worst recession since the Great Depression, or because of the hard work and ingenuity of American businesses and workers. This is revisionist historyfar from the truth. Its one of more than 1,500 lies or misleading statements President Trump has made since his inauguration on the economy alone, according to The Washington Post Fact Checker. He has made more than 16,000 false or deceptive statements on all issues combined. Was the economy a wreck as the president imagines? Did his tax cuts supercharge economic growth? Has the presidents trade war helped American businesses and consumers? The evidence shows these assertions are absolutely falseand that in some ways Trump economic policy has done more harm than good. Lets look at the facts. When President Trump took office, the economy was strong and getting stronger. Unemployment had been cut by more than half and stood at 4.7 percent. The economy had added jobs for 76 straight months. Wages were rising, inflation was low, GDP growth was solid. To call this dismal is ridiculously dishonest. In important ways, the economy under Donald Trump has lagged behind the economy under Barack Obama. Lets look at job growthin the first 35 months of the Trump administration, the economy added about 191,000 jobs per month. In the last 35 months of the Obama administration, approximately 227,000 jobs were created each month. Thats 36,000 fewer jobs each month under Trump. How about business investment, which is key to long-term economic growth? The Republican tax cuts, the presidents signature legislative accomplishment, were supposed to accelerate investment. But growth in business investment has slowed after a small initial bump and it now has declined for three consecutive quarters. GDP growth also has disappointed. The president promised that his nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts would be like rocket fuel for the economy. GDP growth would be as high as 6 percent! But that hasnt happenedthe rocket fuel didnt power the economy skyward. Annual GDP growth has not reached 3 percent since the tax cuts were enacted, and it slowed to 2.3 percent in 2019. Part of the challenge is that the presidents trade war has created headwinds for the economy. It has harmed everyone from American suppliers to farmers to wholesalers to retailers to consumers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the administrations trade policies will shave 0.5 percent from GDP this year and reduce average household income by nearly $1,300. Finally, there is the cost of the tax giveawaysthe increase to our national debt. The president and his advisers promised that their 2017 tax cuts would pay for themselves. There was extensive reporting on the second year anniversary of the tax cuts in December that this claim has proven false. However, just last week, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin doubled down on this myth. CBO estimates that the tax cuts will add $1.9 trillion to our national debt. Deficits already have rocketed higher, from $585 billion during the last year of the Obama administration to $984 billion in 2019. CBO forecasts the deficit will reach $1 trillion this year and an average $1.3 trillion between 2021 and 2030. These fast-growing deficits when the economy is strong constrain investments we should be making in education and infrastructure now and will limit our fiscal response when we have to confront the next recession. I suspect that these facts wont make it into the presidents State of the Union Address. As with so many other subjects, he will have alternative facts. Even though his version of reality has been proven to be fanciful, he will continue to claim that he inherited a dismal economy from Barack Obama and that he has worked miracles. This isnt remotely true. The fact checkers are going to be very, very busy. Don Beyer represents Virginias 8th District and is vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee.

I have been hard at work and wanted to update you on my work, both in Washington, DC and back home in Houston.  During the December and January District Work Periods, I was in Washington fulfilling my constitutional duty as part of the ongoing impeachment process against President Donald&nbsp;Trump. In December, we held&nbsp;numerous hearings in the House Judiciary Committee leading up to the impeachment of the President for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.   On January 15th, I was named one of the seven impeachment managers tasked with presenting the people&#8217;s case for removing the President from office before the U.S. Senate and the American people.  Despite having to spend more time in DC because of impeachment, my team and I have participated in many events across the Texas 29th Congressional District, including: Co-Sponsoring a Townhall Action Meeting on Cancer Clusters with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,&nbsp;participating in&nbsp;various School Board Appreciation Month Celebrations, and attending a community breakfast hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).

Legislative Update:  House Democrats and I have been hard at work on behalf of the people of America. Below you can read my legislative update on work taking place on the Judiciary Committee and Financial Services Committees, the two committees that I have the honor of serving on.  Major&nbsp;updates from the House Judiciary Committee:  H.R. 5645: Eyes on the Courts Act of 2020 On January 16th, 2019, Chairman Nadler along with other bipartisan members reintroduced the &#8220;Eyes on the Courts Act.&#8220; This legislation will require cameras be permitted in the Supreme Court and all federal appellate courts. This legislation would provide transparency and allow Americans to have access to court proceedings.  Remain In Mexico Policy Investigation On January 14th, 2019, the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, including myself, launched an investigation into how the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; immigration policy has morphed into a policy where refugees and asylum seekers are being kept in Mexico indefinitely without due process or access to counsel. This investigation will help to ensure the health and safety of asylum seekers at the border.  Major&nbsp;updates from the Financial Services Committee:  H.R. 4302: Homeless Assistance Act of 2019 This bill would allow public housing agencies to share data with local governments and nonprofit service providers, which will help them better identify people who experience homelessness and who need to use multiple services. I supported this bill because I believe it is critical that our social service providers are able to effectively connect residents with resources&nbsp;  H.R. 5315: Expanding Opportunities for MDIs Act This bill would strengthen a U.S. Department of Treasury program to encourage collaboration between Minority Depository Institutions (MDI&#8217;s) and large financial institutions. I am a proud supporter of this bill, as I strongly believe in supporting American small business, especially those that are women and minority-owned.  H.R. 2398: Veteran HOUSE Act of 2020 This bill would expand the eligibility for the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program to veterans experiencing homelessness who have received an other-than-honorable (but not dishonorable) discharge. Supporting our veterans is important to me, and the passage of this bill is one step closer to providing supportive case management and access to resources for those who need it most.&nbsp;  Other major bills in the House of Representatives:  H.R.&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; Lower Drug Costs Now Act This bill would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug manufacturers for lower prices. Insulin is one of the first drugs the secretary must negotiate, and the lower prices will be available to Medicare beneficiaries and those with private insurance. This is an issue that is particularly close to my heart, since seven of my nine&nbsp;siblings are diabetic. This a critical step forward in the fight for affordable healthcare, and it is especially important here in our district where 30% of our district is uninsured according to the US Census Bureau. War Powers Resolution On January 9, 2020, the House of Representatives voted to approve a resolution aimed at restraining the President's ability to use military action against Iran without congressional approval. The resolution states that &#8220; the United States military force, American people and members of the United States Armed Forces deserve a credible explanation regarding the use of military force.&#8221;  Notable News:        Texas Tribune: Garcia got to Congress, and landed in&nbsp;this impeachment role, through quiet competence, resilience amid the rough and tumble nature of Harris County politics&nbsp;and an ability to develop key relationships with friends and rivals alike, according to interviews with over a dozen Texas Democrats.

I want to thank all of our law enforcement officials for their work to keep everyone safe during this exciting time. Let us all remember to be respectful of those in uniform during our celebrations throughout the week. How 'bout those Chiefs!  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Impeachment Update: Voting on Witnesses When I signed the oath book at the beginning of this trial, I vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law. I took this oath and responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until I heard arguments from both the House managers and the president&#8217;s lawyers.&nbsp;It became clear over the course of the House managers&#8217; arguments that the House failed to undertake its responsibility to collect supporting evidence, and the managers continually attempted to shift that evidentiary responsibility to the Senate.&nbsp;Nevertheless, having heard from both sides, the arguments demonstrate that additional evidence or witnesses would not change the material underlying facts that describe the president&#8217;s actions. Therefore, I voted to not permit additional witnesses and to continue with the impeachment trial.  &nbsp;  Putting Veterans Above Partisanship in the Senate VA CommitteeThis week, I gaveled in the Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee for the first time as chairman. In my opening remarks, I presented my vision for the committee including one of my top priorities &#150; addressing the veteran suicide epidemic. I will do everything I can to see that this committee remains a place where we put veterans well above partisanship. I expressed to my colleagues that I don&#8217;t expect us to always agree on everything, but I don&#8217;t know of any reason why this committee can&#8217;t be an agreeable place where we work to find consensus and common ground &#150; a point on which we can rally on every occasion. Watch my full opening remarks&nbsp;here.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Passing Veteran Suicide Prevention Legislation Out of Committee  As chairman, my committee successfully approved 10 bills and one nomination in a unanimous, bipartisan manner. All these bills will significantly improve the lives and well-being of veterans. The&nbsp;Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act&nbsp;that I sponsored with Ranking Member Jon Tester (D-Mont.) was favorably reported out of committee by a vote of 17-0. Losing one veteran to suicide is too many, but sadly an estimated 20 veterans die by suicide each day. This legislation is a big step forward in addressing the veteran suicide epidemic. It works to expand access to mental health care for veterans by strategically reaching veterans in hard-to-reach places like rural Kansas and providing our veterans with alternative and innovative treatments. As our veterans transition out of the military, they are dealing with the invisible wounds of war that often go unnoticed and untreated. This legislation, named after an American hero we lost to mental health struggles, offers critical resources to help veterans. It is my wish that this bill will bring honor to Commander Hannon and other veterans who have perished due to suicide and provide hope to those who struggle with their mental health. I look forward to continue working on behalf of our veterans as Chairman of the Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee and sharing with you progress throughout the year.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Hosting Secretary Robert Wilkie and Veteran Service Organizations On Wednesday night, I hosted Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, representatives of Veterans Service Organizations and fellow Kansans as we kicked off a new year of hard work in support of our nation&#8217;s veterans. This gathering was an opportunity to highlight my priorities as the Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and engage with veteran advocates on future of VA care. We discussed the importance of providing our veterans with quality mental health care and the Senate VA Committee&#8217;s recent passage of my bill, the&nbsp;Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act. This legislation, which must be considered by the full Senate, will increase access to mental health care for veterans by investing in research, bolstering the VA&#8217;s mental health care workforce and investing in new, innovative therapies. We also talked about the implementation of the MISSION Act and the impact that a robust community care system will have on rural veterans. A special thanks to the Kansans that traveled to D.C. to be with us at this event. It was a pleasure to host Secretary Wilkie, my fellow committee members, veterans and advocates.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Production Rate Agreement Between Spirit and Boeing Last Thursday, Spirit AeroSystems announced an agreement with Boeing establishing a preliminary production rate for the 737 MAX airplane. The production rate agreement between Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems is a good first step for the Wichita aerospace community, and I look forward to Spirit&#8217;s ultimate return to robust production levels. In the meantime, I will&nbsp;continue&nbsp;supporting our community partners and all those impacted through my participation on the Aerospace Task Force. I will also continue the conversations I have had with&nbsp;President Trump, Vice President Pence, &nbsp;FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson and Boeing CEO David Calhoun&nbsp;to work to return the 737 MAX safely back in the air.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Attending the White House USMCA Signing Ceremony  On Wednesday, I was pleased to attend the USMCA signing ceremony with President Trump at the White House. This agreement, negotiated by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), strengthens trade relationships with Canada and Mexico, our two largest export markets, at a critical time for farmers, ranchers and manufacturers in Kansas. Growing these partnerships is vital for the success of our state&#8217;s economy. This agreement will expand market access for U.S. dairy products and level the playing field for U.S. wheat sold in Canada. USMCA is a modern trade agreement, setting a template for 21st-century trade deals that can be used to expand trade with other important trade partners. It was great to join members of the Kansas Livestock Association in attendance, including Jerry Bohn, Harry Moser, Jerry Kuckelman and Barb Downey. As chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that funds USTR, I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration to increase trade relationships with our global partners.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Meeting with Secretary Pompeo On Tuesday morning, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the State Department to discuss advancing America&#8217;s interests overseas. We reviewed the impact of the recent trade deal with China, particularly in regard to agriculture and aviation, as well as ongoing issues in Europe. I thank Secretary Pompeo for his time and hospitality.  &nbsp;  Meeting with KCMO Mayor Quinton Lucas  Later on Tuesday, I had a productive meeting with Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas to discuss the Department of Justices' new initiative, Operation Relentless Pursuit, to address violent crime in the Kansas City area. We also discussed Zero Fare transit and the need for increased regional collaboration for the Greater Kansas City area to reach its full potential. I appreciate the Mayor&#8217;s focus on collaboration across state lines and look forward to continue working with him moving forward.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Speaking with the Short Line Railroad Association  On Tuesday, I received an award from the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association for my work on the 45G tax credit used to repair and upgrade short line railroads. This critical tax credit was first established by legislation I introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, which encouraged railroads, railroad customers and suppliers to invest in maintaining the more than 2,000 miles of short line rails in Kansas. Located in the center of America&#8217;s heartland, Kansas is one of the leading rail and distribution centers in our country and plays an integral role connecting farmers and factories with communities around the globe. The tax credit was extended at the end of last year, making it retroactive to 2018 and effective through 2022 and the longest extension ever granted to the tax credit by the federal government. Additionally, in January 2019, I introduced the&nbsp;BRACE Act&nbsp;that would make this critical tax provision permanent.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Recognizing Data Privacy Day  Tuesday was also Data Privacy Day - a reminder that Americans deserve assurances regarding how businesses are collecting and using their personally identifiable information. As chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, I have conducted public hearings and made inquiries to hold businesses accountable and gain a better understanding of how they are using consumers&#8217; data while working to improve federal laws to protect consumers in a rapidly developing technological age. Congress needs to pass comprehensive legislation that protects consumers&#8217; data privacy and work to promote responsible regulatory changes that empower consumers rather than deceiving them.  &nbsp;  Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.&nbsp;  Please let me know how I can be of assistance.

Dear Lindsey: AT A GLANCE In this week's Digest, you will find information on: * An update on the Senate impeachment trial; * Announcement of my State of the Union guest ? Isabel Bueso from Concord; and * An amendment to prevent companies from using credit scores to discriminate. IMPEACHMENT UPDATE Last week, the Senate voted to deny witnesses and evidence in the impeachment trial, effectively setting up a vote to acquit the President later this week. The vote was largely along party lines, with only two Republican Senators joining every Democrat in voting to hear from witnesses like former National Security Advisor John Bolton. This week, the Senate will hear closing arguments from the House managers and the President?s attorneys and will vote on whether to find Donald Trump guilty on the articles of impeachment. To hear the Congressman?s thoughts on the Senate?s vote to block witnesses and evidence, and the upcoming vote on whether to find the President guilty and remove him from office, click the video below.  STATE OF THE UNION Tomorrow, February 4th, President Trump will deliver the State of the Union address to the American public. Congressman DeSaulnier?s guest for the event is Isabel Bueso, a recipient of medical deferred action and rare disease advocate. Isabel has been in the country legally for 17 years to participate in a clinical trial and receive life-saving medical care. Last year, Isabel and her family were targeted by the Trump Administration?s cruel immigration policies when they were told they had 33 days to leave the country, a move that would have been a death sentence for Isabel. Isabel?s story is an example of the real-life impacts of President Trump?s cruel immigration policy. Isabel is a courageous advocate and deserves to stay in this country and receive the medical care she needs.

LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS Mark Joins Colleagues in Reclaiming Congressional War Powers For almost two decades, Presidents have been exploiting a law passed in the wake of 9/11 intended to protect our country, not intended to open unlimited power for the President. That law, known as an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), is long expired. The Constitution gives Congress the explicit right to declare war. We must act to reclaim that power. Mark voted in favor of measures drafted by his colleagues Representatives Barbara Lee and Ro Khanna - one that would repeal the above-mentioned AUMF and one that would stop any federal funds from being used for a war with Iran until Congress votes to authorize that conflict. Our service women and men deserve to have the intensely consequential decision to send them to war to be debated rigorously and restore that decision to Congress, not just one person sitting in the White House. Congressman DeSaulnier Passes an Amendment to Prevent Discrimination in Housing Decisions Credit scores and reports impact many aspects of our lives from determining how much interest we pay on loans to whether we can rent or buy a home. The Comprehensive CREDIT Act (H.R. 3621) will help ensure that consumer rights are protected and improve transparency over credit scores and reporting. Mark successfully included a provision in the bill that will require additional information to be gathered to help prevent companies from using credit scores and reports from discriminating in who they give mortgages to. H.R. 3621 passed with Mark?s support by a vote of 221-to-189. To see Mark speak on this provision, click on the image below.  BY THE NUMBERS Sincerely, Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress ?

Trump, effectively condoning the President&#8217;s crimes and&nbsp;the railroading of our Constitution. I believe, and the majority of America knows, that&nbsp;this President can&#8217;t be legitimately acquitted because he never underwent a real trial.  The sham trial began ominously when Senator Mitch McConnell, in the dead of night, pushed&nbsp;through a set of trial rules without guarantees for key witnesses or documents and despite the Trump Administration&#8217;s blatant obstruction of Congress and the American people from hearing all the facts of the case. Nevertheless, the House managers presented a powerful case, proving to the American people that the President must be removed from office for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. As the President&#8217;s defense team presented its arguments, a shocking development heightened the urgent need for witness testimony and documents to be turned over to Congress that this&nbsp;Administration refused&nbsp;to provide. Friday night's vote by Republican Senators not to call witnesses and provide the public with a complete and unvarnished accounting of the President's scheme to bribe Ukraine with millions of dollars of badly needed military funding and equipment -- funds&nbsp;already approved by&nbsp;Congress -- in&nbsp;exchange for dirt on his political&nbsp;rival makes them complicit in&nbsp;the President's&nbsp;scheme.&nbsp;Without witnesses or evidence this is not a trial, it's a travesty.  Republicans in the House and Senate&nbsp;who have willingly gone&nbsp;along with&nbsp;the President's&nbsp;defense that anything he does, no matter how criminal or corrupt, is unimpeachable if he says it's in the public's interest has placed&nbsp;our entire system of government, the rule of law, and our Constitution in great peril. This is a moment in history that revealed&nbsp;those who&nbsp;had the courage and conviction to uphold their duty, and those who cared more about advancing the power of their party and hanging onto their seats.  Despite this historic low point, the Democratically controlled House continued with critical&nbsp;legislative business to benefit hardworking Americans and their families.&nbsp;I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to make it easier for military survivors to report sexual assaults. I also led a letter with 49 of my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women. Though the examples are numerous, the letter was prompted&nbsp;in light of his most recent comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing \"a good job\" on a reporter that Pompeo&nbsp;verbally attacked simply&nbsp;because she did her job.

On Friday, The New York Times reported that Bolton's manuscript contains details of the President directing Bolton to help with the President's pressure campaign&nbsp;on&nbsp;Ukraine, which dangled the promise of a White House meeting and critically needed&nbsp;funding for the fledgling democracy&nbsp;in exchange for a hit job&nbsp;on Trump&#8217;s political rival. The article states,&nbsp;&#8220;Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president&#8217;s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president&#8217;s impeachment defense.&#8221; That gun isn&#8217;t just smoking, the barrel is&nbsp;red hot and the trigger is covered with the President's grubby fingerprints. The Senate trial heads into its final&nbsp;conclusion&nbsp;next week following&nbsp;Senate Republicans vote&nbsp;Friday night against calling fact witnesses or requiring a shred of documentary evidence to be presented. Rest assured that&nbsp;my Democratic colleagues in the House and I will continue to fight the President's and Republicans' attempts to consolidate power in the Executive Branch and their cover-up&nbsp;of his crimes&nbsp;and corruption. America needs and demands the truth; we will not rest until all the facts are unearthed for the public's view and benefit.  Introduced Legislation to Make it Safe for Military Survivors to Report Assault On Thursday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague, Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE), to make it easier for sexual assault survivors across the military to report their assailants. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) expect to introduce companion legislation in the United States soon. Too many sexual assault survivors in our military and academies hesitate to report attacks because they fear they be punished for minor infractions&#8212;such as underage drinking or curfew violations&#8212;that may be uncovered during the assault investigation. Getting survivors to report these incidents so that they can access services and perpetrators can be held accountable is should be the focus of military leadership, not punishment of victims for minor misconduct. Our bill will ensure survivors cannot be punished for minor issues when they report an assault, unless aggravating circumstances exist. The Air Force Academy has already tested this program and seen positive results. Survivors and their loved ones should know that will fight hard to pass this legislation in this year&#8217;s National Defense Authorization Act, and that they are not alone.  Sent Letter to the President Condemning his Continuing Degradation of Women a letter to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women. The letter was sent on the heels of Secretary Pompeo disparaging NPR&#8217;s Mary Louise Kelly, a well-renowned journalist, for doing her job when she asked Pompeo about Ukraine. Kelly said that Pompeo shouted and swore at her and demanded she find the country on an unmarked map, which she did with no trouble. Pompeo then barred the reporter from covering his upcoming trip to Europe. The next day, President Trump validated this misogynistic and autocratic behavior by stating, &#8220;you did a good job on her.&#8221; Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, an esteemed career diplomat committed to anti-corruption reforms who the President referred to as &#8220;the woman&#8221; who is &#8220;going to go through some things&#8221; in the infamous July 25 call with President Zelensky, was yet another casualty. It is most shameful that the words young girls and boys hear directed at women from the upper echelons of power are dripping with disdain and disrespect. It is as if this President relishes the opportunity to publicly humiliate any woman who fights back, speaks up, or takes up space. As the women of the DWC admonished him in our letter, the President of the United States should set a moral example for our children, not be the biggest bully on the playground.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Asked Defense Department About Remedial Action for Whistleblower Retaliation At a hearing this week of the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, we heard from a panel of government officials and experts on the need for stronger whistleblower protections in our laws. As Co-Chair of the House&#8217;s Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I have long advocated for whistleblower protection laws and have secured crucial legislative victories advancing rights to intelligence and congressional whistleblowers.  Much of the hearing focused on the huge backlog of 2,500 cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has been unable to function for over a year because President Trump and Senator McConnell have failed to fill seats on the board for quorum. I asked Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, why there possibly could be cases of illegal reprisals against whistleblowers that are substantiated during inspector general investigations and yet never result in compensation for the whistleblower. Fine agreed with me that there is a &#8220;disturbing&#8221; trend of defense agencies essentially ignoring inspector general recommendations to make whistleblowers whole, and that Congress must continue to put pressure and legislate to protect whistleblowers.  Armed Services Committee Hearing on Security of the Korean Peninsula On Tuesday, I pressed representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Intelligence Agency at the House Armed Services Committee&#8217;s hearing on the lack of a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea. The President gave Kim Jong-un multiple PR victories, praising him, meeting with him, and becoming the first U.S. President to set foot in North Korea, raising their global recognition and validating a regime never before recognized by Democratic or Republican Administrations. None of these displays got us any closer to containing the North Korean threat. Now, the Administration claims it&#8217;s applying a &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; campaign. However, it&#8217;s also pressuring and disrespecting our allies in South Korea and Japan, demanding outrageous increases to the billions of dollars our allies already contribute annually to our mutual defense. The President&#8217;s handling of the security region is erratic and dangerous. We must continue to demand a coherent strategy for dealing with our adversaries and hold this Administration&#8217;s feet to the fire for the safety and security of the region and our country.  Oversight Committee Hearing on &#8220;75 Years After the Holocaust: The Ongoing Battle Against Hate&#8221; Tuesday, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Additional hearings will be held in the coming weeks on voter suppression in minority communities, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim discrimination, anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions, and challenges facing LGBTQ individuals. As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I&#8217;ll also preside at a hearing next month on the dangers of white supremacist elements in our military.  Discussion on Poverty in the 21st Century and its Impact on Women As Co-Chair of the Democratic Women&#8217;s Caucus, I participated in a discussion on modern day poverty and its disproportionate impact on women. We heard from experts who explained the shocking reality that more people die of poverty in America than heart attacks and cancer combined. For millions of Americans, every day is a struggle to avoid eviction, put food on the table, or pay for just one doctor&#8217;s visit. Beyond these challenges, many women also take on the dual responsibilities of a traditional job and home and child care. This &#8220;social production&#8221; work constitutes a second job, but it&#8217;s not adequately valued in our society. In a particularly heart-breaking moment, I listened as one mother recounted her daughter&#8217;s struggle with cancer. Like many Americans struggling with inadequate health care, her daughter went to an emergency room after discovering a lump in her breast and was turned away without any additional care or tests due to her lack of health insurance. After months of no medical care, severe pains forced her back to the ER. The untreated cancer had spread through her entire body and caused her breast to completely rot off. As the wealthiest country in the world, it is a choice &#8211; not a forced reality &#8211; to not invest in affordable health care for every American. Indeed, the mother&#8217;s home state of Alabama opted out of the Medicaid expansion. No mother should have to watch her daughter die before her eyes knowing it was avoidable. Doubling rates of homelessness, hospital closures to make way for real estate development, and a complete lack of affordable dental care rounded out the discussion and further underscored the inhumane inequality growing in our country. We must remember that our nation&#8217;s successes cannot be fairly measured without considering everyone that has been left behind.    Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives from CalPERS  I am proud of all of California&#8217;s public employees and pleased that their retirement is in the hands of the trustworthy and forward-thinking managers at CalPERS.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District  Here are some issues they raised this week: &#8226; 96 constituents expressed their concern for the climate crisis. We must take bold action to combat climate change, end our addiction to fossil fuels, and grow our green economy. How we address climate change now will be the defining moment of this century. You have my word that I will be a vigorous advocate for bold action to solve this crisis so that we can leave a healthier planet for future generations. &#8226; 60 constituents shared their support for our public lands. For years, Republicans in Congress have waged a war against our public lands, introducing dangerous bills that threaten public land ownership and benefit special interest groups and corporate polluters at the expense of our environment. I have consistently voted against legislation that would allow state governments to sell or exploit public lands for profit and I have fought efforts to scale back protections under the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other critical environmental safeguards. &#8226; 22 constituents expressed their support for increased consumer safety regulations. As an avid proponent of consumer protection, I recognize the importance of improved labeling and consumer education campaigns and have introduced legislation to combat risks ranging from lead-filled children&#8217;s glasses to poisonous detergent pods. I am currently working on a bill to address the extensive contamination of PFAS, or forever chemicals, in cosmetics and personal care products.

While the risk is low, this is a rapidly changing situation and the CDC recommends taking some precautions including getting a flu shot and taking everyday preventative actions to stop the spread of germs.

I was proud to support the trade agreement when it was before the U.S. House of Representatives. The USMCA is a big win for American workers, farmers and families. The agreement is expected to create 176,000 new jobs, spur $68 billion in economic growth, create a new chapter on digital trade and expand agricultural markets.

FIGHTING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. It is a schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act. However, drug traffickers have been able to make small changes to fentanyls chemical structure, creating new variations of the substance called analogues. Because of how quickly the traffickers are able to modify the substance, most of these analogues are not on the schedule of controlled drugs and are therefore outside of the control of law enforcement. The creation of analogues has outpaced DEAs ability to schedule them. Fortunately, the Controlled Substances Act provides the Attorney General with the authority to temporarily place a substance in schedule I of the CSA for two years if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. In 2018, the DEA used this authority to place fentanyl analogues and fentanyl like substances in Schedule I. This authority is only temporary, though, and the emergency scheduling order was set to expire next week. We worked this week to bring an extension to the Floor and I'm very glad that it passed. In one year alone, synthetic opioids like fentanyl claimed more than 32,000 American lives and we must do everything we can to stop it. FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCLI January 27, 2020: On Saturday I attended the memorial scripture service for Darien City Manager Tim Sweezey, who died unexpectantly earlier this month.

This plan includes&nbsp;elements of&nbsp;my&nbsp;legislation, H.R. 3663, the&nbsp;Complete Streets Act.&nbsp;This bill promotes&nbsp;improving safety on our streets for all users, including pedestrians and cyclists. As a senior member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will work to&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that the&nbsp;framework supports the ongoing Bus Rapid Transit &#8220;Innovation Corridor&#8221; project now under way linking downtown Memphis with the University of Memphis. See my release about the framework here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Comprehensive CREDIT Act with My Amendments&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, I voted for,&nbsp;and the House passed,&nbsp;the Comprehensive Credit Rating Enhancement, Disclosure, Innovation and Transparency (CREDIT) Act that contained elements&nbsp;of two bills I have introduced. I also offered two amendments&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;the&nbsp;first specifies the time period in which&nbsp;credit reporting agencies&nbsp;must&nbsp;remove loan default from consumer credit reports&nbsp;and the second&nbsp;clarifies that credit reports cannot be used as the sole reason for denial of employment &#8211; both of which&nbsp;were added to the bill.&nbsp;I have been working for 11 years to make sure consumers have access to their credit scores without charge and that prospective employees are not denied jobs because of their credit. See my release, including my floor speeches in favor of my amendments, here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioning GSA about Trump International Hotel Lease&nbsp;    On Tuesday, I questioned the top official in the General Services Administration (GSA) about the Trump Organization&#8217;s&nbsp;reported plan to sell its lease of the historic Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is currently&nbsp;the Trump International Hotel. See my release and my exchange with the official here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting&nbsp;to Prevent the President from Unilaterally Going to War with Iran&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; On Thursday, I voted&nbsp;to prohibit federal funds from being used for military action in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war.&nbsp; I also voted to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Iraq.&nbsp;The repeal removes the false rationale for any action the President might take that could be political in nature and not a legitimate&nbsp;defense of our country. We must impress on this President&nbsp;that Congress has the sole authority to declare war.&nbsp;These votes will save lives and promote diplomatic solutions to our tense international relations.&nbsp;See my release on those votes here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing International Holocaust Remembrance Day at the United Nations&nbsp;   On Monday, I was one of two invited members of Congress who attended the United Nations International Holocaust Remembrance Day in New York.&nbsp;We&nbsp;observed the 75th&nbsp;anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp&nbsp;where 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed. Speakers included the U.N. Secretary General and Holocaust survivors who told of the horrors they endured. See my release about attending the ceremony here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemning Anti-Semitism from the House Floor&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from observing the United Nations&#8217;&nbsp;International&nbsp;Holocaust Remembrance&nbsp; Day, I went to the House floor to deliver some remarks.

This plan is the centerpiece of our For the People Agenda and will work to both address the climate crisis and make our infrastructure smarter, safer and long-lasting.

Though this new case is the first person-to-person transmission in the United States, both cases in Illinois were in very close contact as the individuals are married. There is no cause for panic as these cases in our state are in isolation and both individuals are in recovery. The risk to Illinoisans and the general public is still low. The best defense for this coronavirus and any other virus&#8212;including the flu&#8212;is good public health practice like washing your hands and covering your cough. I will continue to provide more information as it becomes available. Please visit the&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus&nbsp;for additional resources and the most current information. CDC has a team on the ground in Illinois, and the agency is working directly with the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of Public Health to continue investigating close contacts of these cases.          Dear Friend: Thank you for being a subscriber. Below is my latest weekly video update,&nbsp;Jan's Plans &amp; Pans. I've also included the latest on the President's impeachment trial and other updates from this week.             Sincerely,    Impeachment Update This week marked the beginning of the defense&#8217;s case with White House attorneys (inadvertently) making a strong case for first-hand witnesses to be called in the Senate trial. White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin notably argued that 'cross-examination in our legal system is regarded as the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth' making it all the more clear that a fair Senate trial must include witnesses.  On Monday, we saw explosive new evidence by way of an allegation from former National Security Adviser John Bolton that Trump explicitly told him he wanted to withhold Ukraine&#8217;s military aid until they investigated Biden. We also saw a new recording in which the President asks Lev Parnas (whom he has repeatedly claimed not to know) how long Ukraine could fend off Russian aggression without U.S. support. These two revelations further underscore how Republicans&#8217; efforts to block new witnesses and documents are untenable. Additionally, new polling shows that 82% of Americans believe Bolton should testify, and some key Republican Senators have now expressed a desire to call witnesses, including John Bolton.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the White House&#8217;s defense closed their case with the ridiculous argument that the President is innocent because anything he does to get re-elected is unimpeachable. While this is neither grounded in law nor fact, it remains to be seen whether Republicans will accept this argument and help execute a blatant cover-up by acquitting the President.  On Wednesday and Thursday, Senators submitted written questions that the House impeachment managers and White House defense attorneys answered. Over the next few days the Senate will debate, and eventually vote on, whether to include additional evidence or call new witnesses. They will also vote on whether to acquit or remove the President from office. I look forward to updating you as the case continues.    House Votes to Repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF Resolution On Thursday,&nbsp;I voted to repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq because we cannot allow this, or any future President, to drag us into a war that Congress never intended to authorize. The Legislative Branch of government has the sole Constitutional authority to declare war, and the President must heed the will of the American people, represented by Congress, before engaging in any offensive military actions. The repeal of the 2002 AUMF will stop the Executive Branch of government from skirting the Constitution when it comes to matters of war and our national security. Congress passed the 2002 Iraq AUMF to authorize the war against Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime in Iraq. I voted against that resolution. Saddam Hussein has been dead for over a decade, Iraq is now a fledgling democracy, and the Trump Administration concedes there are no ongoing military operations that independently rely on the legal authority provided by the 2002 AUMF. It is Congress&#8217;s constitutional duty to determine whether and when the United States chooses war, not this reckless President&#8217;s. I will continue speaking out and voting against unjustified war and work to prevent any further escalation and violence in Iraq or Iran.   Trump's \"Peace Plan\" An announcement by the White House&nbsp;this week that a peace plan had been agreed on was actually a peace scam. The timing of its roll-out was not designed to facilitate a sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians, but rather was a desperate attempt to advance the political fortunes of a President and Prime Minister consumed by scandal. Had this been a serious plan, the Palestinians would have been part of a negotiation. They were not. Such a unilateral move is doomed to failure, and makes it harder to reach a real peace plan that includes two states for two peoples                WASHINGTON, DC2367 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202)225-2111 CHICAGO5533 N.

The trial began with three days of the House Impeachment Managers making their case for removal, followed by three days of the President&#8217;s attorneys defending him. Senators then submitted written questions which the Chief Justice read aloud and the House Managers and the President&#8217;s attorneys responded to. On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives continued advancing its agenda for the people by introducing and passing bills, holding hearings, and oversight of the Executive Branch.  As I write this to you, we await the decision of the full Senate as to whether witnesses and documents will be allowed in the trial.&nbsp;  Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week   CDC Briefing on Coronavirus I met with Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response; and Rear Admiral Denise Hinton with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The coronavirus is a respiratory illness caused by a virus first identified in Wuhan, China. Most of the known cases and all deaths associated with the disease have been in China, with only seven confirmed cases in the U.S. to date. According to the CDC, the risk to the American public is low, unless someone has recently traveled to Wuhan and is experiencing respiratory symptoms. For the latest information about the coronavirus, visit the CDC&#8217;s website. To prevent transmission of diseases, two simple but powerful acts of prevention are recommended. Wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly, and cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and everyone should get a flu shot. Questioned the CEO of PG&amp;E at House Energy and Commerce Hearing on Wildfires  The two most destructive fires in Californian history, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed over 18,000 buildings, were linked to PG&amp;E&#8217;s equipment. On January 29th I grilled the CEO of PG&amp;E, Bill Johnson, about the utility&#8217;s widespread intentional blackouts at a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Environment &amp; Climate Change on the impact of wildfires on the power sector and the environment. You can watch my questions from the hearing HERE. Addressing the scourge of wildfires in California continues to be a top priority for me. Last October, I introduced the Smoke Planning and Research Act to provide federal funding to help communities research, develop, and implement plans to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke. I&#8217;m also pushing hard to strengthen infrastructure to withstand wildfires. In July, 2019, I introduced the WIRED Act to allow states to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that will be resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters. Currently, states lack this authority and the consequences have been dire. Health Subcommittee Hearing on Food and Drug Safety  As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine ten mostly bipartisan bills to improve the safety and transparency in our food and drugs. Twenty cents out of every dollar spent by American consumers goes toward food or medicine regulated by the FDA. We examined the FDA&#8217;s immense mission with two panels of expert witnesses. Our first panel considered four bills to grant the FDA new authorities to tackle challenges that threaten our drug supply. Taken together, these bills improve the drug supply chain from the very beginning to the very end so that patients have access to quality products that are genuine, affordable, and accurately labeled. The second panel considered six bills that affect the FDA&#8217;s oversight of food products. Many of these bills act on decisions that the FDA has long delayed. For example, we heard about one bill, the FASTER Act, which would require food manufacturers to list sesame as an allergen on their products. It would also fund into federal studies to better understand the growing prevalence of food allergies in the United States. To watch my opening statement, click HERE. Voted YES on the No War Against Iran Act  President Trump&#8217;s assassination of General Soleimani has placed U.S. service members, diplomats, embassies, and allied interests around the world at high risk, and has brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war. To add insult to injury, the President failed to properly consult Congress or seek the legal authority to take military action against Iran. The Administration has also failed to fully explain what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the U.S. that required the strike. No Member of Congress carries a brief for General Soleimani or the Iranian government, but no President has the unilateral authority to take our nation to war without authorization from Congress. The No War Against Iran Act underscores that Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Iran. It also prohibits federal funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution. I&#8217;ve long had concerns about the Trump Administration&#8217;s provocative behavior toward Iran, beginning with the President tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, and it&#8217;s why I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act last April. My bill restricts this Administration and any future administrations from using any funds appropriated by Congress to take military action in and against Iran without authorization from Congress.&nbsp; House Infrastructure Package  This week the Majority released our framework for a five-year $760 billion infrastructure bill. The framework addresses our nation&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure by investing in zero-emission vehicles, expands access to broadband, upgrades clean water infrastructure, and creates an estimated 10 million new jobs. The package also authorizes $12 billion to modernize our country&#8217;s 9-1-1 systems, based on my legislation the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act. You can read more about the infrastructure plan HERE.  Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Workforce Mobility Act  I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help workers by prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements. This occurs when an employer restricts an employee&#8217;s future prospects through their employment contracts. While California has long prohibited non-competes, 40 percent of Americans have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point in their career. Reps. Scott Peters, Mike Gallagher, and I introduced the Workforce Mobility Act to ban non-compete agreements with a few narrow exceptions (such as the sale of a business). Much of Silicon Valley was built by former employees of one tech company leaving to found another, all allowed because of California&#8217;s ban on non-compete agreements. This ban continues to allow the Valley to prosper as an innovation powerhouse. I&#8217;m proud that my legislation will make this a nationwide policy, ensuring all Americans have the ability to innovate. The Protecting Community Television Act  Community television is a critical part of our society, giving a voice to nonprofits, artists, schools, local governments, and other community members who otherwise struggle to be heard. I introduced legislation to ensure that community television operations continue to receive the resources they need to educate and inform viewers in the cities and towns where they operate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, local governments are permitted to require that cable companies meet community needs by providing in-kind contributions that benefit public, educational, and government (PEG) channels, also known as community television stations. Unfortunately the FCC proposed regulatory changes that would effectively end the in-kind contributions that support PEG stations. Senator Ed Markey and I introduced the Protecting Community Television Act to block the FCC&#8217;s proposal and bolster community TV.   Weekly Highlights  Meeting with the Foreign Minister of Laos  This week I had the honor of welcoming the Foreign Minister of Laos, His Excellency Saleumxay Kommasith, and the Laotian Ambassador to the U.S., His Excellency Khamphan Anlavan, to my Washington, D.C. office. My work to fund the removal of unexploded ordinances, such as landmines in Laos from the Vietnam War era has received bipartisan support in Congress and will save the lives of so many who remain vulnerable to these landmines. I&#8217;ve championed this issue by co-leading the Legacies of War Recognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act.   In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. Over 6,446 constituents have already contacted me in 2020. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me. This week, 1,289 constituents contacted our office about issues including:   137 constituents wrote to me about H.Con.Res. 52 which expresses the sense of Congress that there is an ongoing climate emergency&nbsp;  87 constituents wrote to me about the Helping MOMS Act to help expand access to Medicaid coverage for expectant and new mothers  46 constituents wrote to me about the Children&#8217;s Product Warning Label Act to strengthen cosmetic product safety&nbsp;  Anna&#8217;s Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from.&nbsp;    New York Times (1/27/2020) &#8211; &#8220;At Auschwitz, Holocaust Survivors Plead &#8216;Never Forget&#8217; &#8221;  As the world marks 75 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, I encourage you to take a moment to read about what the survivors want the world to remember about the horrors that took place there.&nbsp; Utility Dive (1/29/2020) &#8211; &#8220;PG&amp;E CEO: System hardening will be completed 'long after I retire&#8217; &#8221;  &#8220;Rep.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act (), the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act (), the Never Again Education Act (), the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act (), the Global Hope Act (), a Resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests (), the Keeping Girls in School Act (), the Tibetan Policy Support Act (), the Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act (), the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act (), an Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the No War With Iran Act (), and an additional Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the Repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF ().  It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!&nbsp; This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month. David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead. They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation. Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .            Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico &#8211; two of Arkansas&#8217;s top trading partners. The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity.  For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs.  The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this week&#8217;s signing delivers a 21st&nbsp;century trade framework. This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural State&#8217;s world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansas&#8217;s hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families. Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansas&#8217;s exports. A&nbsp;&nbsp;from the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million. Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand. It&#8217;s exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December. By negotiating from strength &#8211; the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy. This landmark agreement puts America first! I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line. Promises made, promises kept! The President also announced his . The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people. With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East. No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone &#8211; and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation. On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future. Centuries of hostilities won&#8217;t be solved overnight &#8211; but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path. I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region.  It&#8217;s noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda. While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America. The results speak for themselves &#8211; thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created. &nbsp;In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations. We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory. Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year. On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic.  It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion. Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030. Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window. Our country&#8217;s unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt. Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030. To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget. We&#8217;ve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously. Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt. The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.  It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them. Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions &#8211; which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country. Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesn&#8217;t appear that we&#8217;ll have one this year either. In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year. Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget.  It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face. We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people. Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies. I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith &#8211; who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association &#8211; to discuss the Community Development Block Grant program&nbsp;and other initiatives that support housing and community development.  The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators. It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the University&#8217;s priorities. I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas. I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas. They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development. I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell &#8211; and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District.  My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.&nbsp;We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare.  I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year. The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief. While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House. The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence. Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient.  Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith. The funding &#8211; awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA) &#8211; will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD). These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.  Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District. This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation. By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities. Learn more .

Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, it&#8217;s easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t make progress by standing on the sidelines.&#8221; After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, we&#8217;re not surrendering. In fact, just the opposite: We&#8217;re fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect. It&#8217;s an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives. Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community. I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities. Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you. Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke     &nbsp;    Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents. Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve. Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market. These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home. In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments. The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers. Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings. I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act. This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex. My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes. New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.  &nbsp;     In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the President&#8217;s anti-immigrant agenda. My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R. 6) passed in the House of Representatives last year. According to H.R. 6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America. Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge.   Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the President&#8217;s xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, I&#8217;m committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census. It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community. We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive. Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts. Every person counts.        Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States. I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people. As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests.        Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities. Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R. 4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R. 4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on America&#8217;s national security.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residents&#8212;many in the Ninth District&#8212;were left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared. I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesn&#8217;t happen again. Brooklyn&#8217;s communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century. To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn. With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities. As a firm believer in Congress&#8217; ability to come together and combat this nation&#8217;s contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation.     I am proud that my bill H.R. 5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as &#8220;the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn.&#8221; My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy. Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007. At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing. Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all. In Major Owens&#8217; honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives.        My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell. This inaction is unacceptable. The fact is: background checks save lives. Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns. Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R. 1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm. From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence.        I&#8217;m proud that my bill, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act,&#8221; passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls. If you&#8217;ve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers. These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills. I know robocalls are more than annoying&#8212;they&#8217;re costly. My legislation, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act.&#8221; will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.        Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you. Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents. That&#8217;s why I take every opportunity to celebrate the community, whether it&#8217;s dancing with my friends and constituents at the yearly West Indian Day Parade or eating food from local restaurants and vendors at street fairs, such as the Park Slope 5th Avenue Street Fair.

The hearing this week on the Horseracing Integrity Act was an important step in advancing reforms to protect our equine athletes and jockeys. I remain firm in my belief that the future prosperity of this sport relies on uniformity of rules throughout the industry and I will continue to work to increase the popularity and public confidence in thoroughbred racing throughout the nation. You can watch my complete testimony from this week's hearing on the Horseracing Integrity Act here, and you can watch the entire hearing here. You can read more about Tuesday's hearing and the Horseracing Integrity Act here.  THE LEXINGTON LEGENDS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR DISTRICT AND OUR COMMONWEALTH Earlier this week, I joined House colleagues from Minor League Baseball cities across the U.S. in fighting to preserve teams in our hometowns.&nbsp;Minor league baseball provides so much to our local communities, bringing family friendly entertainment, job opportunities and a significant economic impact to every city a team calls home. The impact of the Lexington Legends is no exception. The 2019 South Atlantic League Champion Legends bring an average economic impact of $47.2 million per year to our community, and in addition, donate an average of $1 million locally. I am committed to doing what I can to support the Legends and ensure that they stay in Lexington for years to come.

I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk' Earlier today, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation formally agreeing to a landmark North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate. Senator McConnell said the following about today&#8217;s signing: &#8220;By signing the USMCA into law, President Trump has delivered a strong trade deal for Kentucky families. I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk, and I look forward to its benefits throughout the Commonwealth. Virtually every family and every industry in Kentucky is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Once the USMCA takes effect, Kentucky&#8217;s workers, farmers and consumers are ready to take advantage of all it has to offer.&#8221;    Recently Senator McConnell penned the following column for Kentucky newspapers:  Kentuckians are rightfully known for being hard workers. I&#8217;m glad more of them, from Paducah to Pikeville, are benefitting from our country&#8217;s strong economy, which has been bolstered by Republican policies. The Republican-led Senate gave Kentucky workers another boost in an overwhelming vote by passing President Trump&#8217;s landmark trade deal called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and I was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate. Once in effect, the USMCA will modernize the trading framework that sends American goods&#151;including Kentucky-made products like bourbon, cars, aerospace parts and agricultural commodities&#151;to customers across the continent. These critical upgrades reflect the development of the new digital economy, bringing the existing deal into the 21st century. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats held President Trump&#8217;s deal hostage for months on end. Their obsession with impeaching the duly-elected president unnecessarily delayed the USMCA and its benefits for Kentucky. American workers and families have paid the price of the Speaker&#8217;s refusal to work with President Trump. In Kentucky, the partisan obstruction couldn&#8217;t end soon enough. Virtually every family and every industry is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home. Farmers, manufacturers and logistics providers right here in the Bluegrass State put their ingenuity to work every day making a wide-range of products enjoyed around the globe.  In 2018 alone, we sent more than $10 billion of Kentucky-made products to Canada and Mexico, representing nearly one-third of all our Commonwealth&#8217;s exports. These sales support good jobs and a strong economy for Kentucky families. The USMCA is our chance to double-down on that success, giving our workers and our communities the certainty they need. The deal&#8217;s new, stronger automotive rules can extend the eye-popping 90 percent increase in motor vehicle exports Kentucky sold to our neighbors over the last decade. International sales of Kentucky-made cars and trucks can lead to more hiring, bigger paychecks and new investments. Just ask the folks in Georgetown&#151;where Toyota recently announced it will hire about 400 new workers&#151;about the benefits of trade. It&#8217;s not just auto-manufacturing, either. Nearly 19,000 Kentucky manufacturing jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, including at more than 500 small- and medium-sized businesses. One study estimated the USMCA could help create 176,000 American jobs, strengthening our country and generating new opportunities for families and communities. Kentucky&#8217;s farmers are ready to take advantage of USMCA&#8217;s innovations that will strengthen and expand markets for their crops. Canada and Mexico bought more than $300 million of the Bluegrass State&#8217;s agricultural products in 2018. At a time when Kentucky growers are tightening their belts, we should do everything in our power to encourage more consumers to buy their wonderful products. Job creators in our state have told me they can grow their businesses and benefit their communities with the USMCA. For example, the deal provides trade certainty to help our distillers by allowing more folks to raise a glass of Kentucky bourbon. Major Kentucky employers like UPS and DHL are also looking forward to USMCA&#8217;s improvements to e-commerce and customs processes, designed to better protect small businesses competing in the online marketplace. They&#8217;ll be able to better connect businesses and consumers, while protecting the environment and American workers.  By approving the deal, the United States is signaling to our neighbors that America is open for business. Once all three countries pass the USMCA, Kentucky&#8217;s workers, farmers and consumers are ready to enjoy all the benefits it has to offer.  Since the day President Trump signed the USMCA with leaders of Canada and Mexico, the deal should have been a no-brainer. Speaker Pelosi should&#8217;ve allowed this deal to pass months ago, but I&#8217;m glad the heel-dragging has come to an end. I hope Democrats will see what we&#8217;re able to accomplish by working together for the people who sent us to Washington in the first place. Then, they can put partisan distractions aside and work with us to continue delivering results.

I enjoyed seeing friends and neighbors as we honored the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the 40th annual Tampa Organization of Black Affairs breakfast, parade and uplifting interfaith service at Allen Temple A.M.E. This week I continue to feel inspired by Dr. Kings words: Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Across the Capitol, the Impeachment trial of President Trump on his Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress continues. Thank you for contacting Floridas U.S. Senators to urge them to conduct a fair trial with witnesses and documents so that all information is made plain to the American people. Tune in today and tomorrow for question from senators. Committee Action (SCCC Logo): I called on Google this week to take steps to stop the spread of dangerous climate denial and climate misinformation videos on YouTube, the most used social platform in the United States as it has done with other dangerous misinformation. Google should take steps to address this harmful misinformation, including ending free advertising of videos promoting harmful falsehoods about the causes and effects of the climate crisis. Full text here. (E&C Logo): My Energy and Commerce Committee is holding two hearings: my Subcommittee on Consumer Protection & Commerce is holding a hearing is entitled, Legislation to Promote the Health and Safety of Racehorses, and my Subcommittee on Health is holding a hearing entitled Improving Safety and Transparency in Americas Food and Drugs. Votes This Week (Photo of KC with Students) H.R. 3621 Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020: This bill removes adverse credit file information relating to defaulted or delinquent private education loans for borrowers who demonstrate a history of timely loan repayments for their loans. Additionally, the bill provides much-needed protection for student loan borrowers by making repayment plans more affordable. (Photo of KC with military leaders) H.R. 550 No War Against Iran Act; To repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002: This bill includes amendments that would repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)  the Iraq Resolution of 2002 - and prohibit funding for military action against Iran that is not authorized by Congress. Since my first congressional campaign in 2006, I have supported a withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq and redeployment of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Although the Constitution vests Congress with the sole power to declare war, President Trump like other presidents before him has taken military action without consulting Congress. I will vote in support of repealing the 2002 Iraq AUMF so that it cannot be used to justify new and unrelated, offensive military actions. H.R. 943 - Never Again Education Act: On Monday, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the House adopted an important inititiave to combat antisemitism by passing bipartisan legislation to schools with tools to teach about the Holocaust. I'm proud to cosponsor this bill. We have a moral obligation to teach about the horrors of the past so they are never repeated. Thank you to the many neighbors and community leaders I saw last week on collaborations to lift our Tampa area neighbors. AARP joined me in highlighting the importance of the House of Representatives passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act to level the playing field for older workers and restoring their rights to fight back against age discrimination. Members of my Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force also joined me to discuss what Tampa nonprofit and community leaders are doing to assist families on the island and those who have relocated to the Tampa Bay area due to Hurricane Maria and recent earthquakes that continue to shake the island. I also helped kick off the University of South Florida College of Public Health Activist Lab Boot Camps session on firearm violence prevention, which provides students with the tools necessary to address todays ongoing public health concerns and communicate with public policymakers.

Working on behalf of dairy farmers in Wisconsin, Idaho and across the country, Senators Baldwin and Risch implored Commissioner Hahn to work with Congress to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products.   &#8220;Dairy farmers across our nation work hard to ensure their products are healthy, nutrient-dense, and in compliance with FDA regulations regarding the use of dairy terms. However, there are many non-dairy imitation products in the marketplace using dairy terms. This represents a clear violation of existing FDA rules,&#8221; said Senator Baldwin and her colleagues. &#8220;When non-dairy alternatives use dairy terms to describe their imitation products, the imitators are often assumed to have the same health benefits and nutrient levels as real dairy products. This is both unfair to our hardworking dairy farmers and problematic for consumers, making it harder for Americans to make educated decisions regarding what they feed themselves and their families.&#8221; &#8220;Under former Commissioner Gottlieb, the FDA began a process of reviewing how to enforce regulations defining what may be labeled a dairy product. That process included a public comment period that has concluded. Dairy farmers are now waiting for action from FDA. We encourage you to move swiftly to address this unfairness and ensure that dairy terms may only be used to describe products that include dairy.&nbsp; Imposter products should no longer be able to get away with violating law and taking advantage of dairy&#8217;s good name,&#8221; the Senators continued.   In addition to Senators Baldwin and Risch, the letter was also signed by Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME). Senators Baldwin and Risch are also lead cosponsors of the DAIRY PRIDE Act of 2019 that would require non-dairy products made from nuts, seeds, plants, and algae to no longer be mislabeled with dairy terms such as milk, yogurt or cheese. Current FDA regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals. Although existing federal regulations are clear, the FDA has not enforced these labeling regulations and the mislabeling of products as &#8216;milk&#8217;, &#8216;yogurt&#8217; and &#8216;cheese&#8217; has increased rapidly. This hurts dairy farmers that work tirelessly to ensure their Made in Wisconsin dairy products meet FDA standards and provide the public with nutritious food.&nbsp; It has also led to the proliferation of mislabeled alternative products that contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.

Senator Scott also has a bill, the Promoting Responsibility In Markets and E-Retailers (PRIME) Act, which will require online retailers to list the country of origin for each product they sell and requires digital apps to disclose their country of origin.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I applaud the Administration for taking swift action to combat the growing threat of counterfeit goods from Communist China. We have to get serious about where our money is going, and we must remain vigilant about where our products come from. Protecting Americans from counterfeit goods is a positive step, but we must keep working. American consumers should know where the products they buy online are made, and my PRIME Act will create more transparency in the online retail space so consumers can make informed choices for themselves and their families.&#8221; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen.

Rick Scott Urges Trump Administration to Protect Americans by Declaring Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement amid reports of more confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States and following a briefing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). On Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agency&#8217;s plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We have to get serious about the threat of coronavirus coming from China. I don&#8217;t trust Communist China to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner when it comes to combatting the treat of the virus, so we have to do everything we can to protect Americans. Today, I&#8217;m calling on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States. While all of the cases are still travel-related, we must take every precaution. Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy. &nbsp; &#8220;At the same time, we must examine the ways the virus is transmitted &#150; including outside the body. Until we have a greater understanding of how the virus is transmitted, we must increase screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott to SEC: Protect American Businesses from the Growing Threat of Communist China  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman expressing concerns about how Communist China&#8217;s recently enacted cryptology laws will affect the security of American businesses and urging the SEC to require disclosures for investors, outlining the alarming reality of the risks they face by investing their hard earned dollars in companies doing business with Communist China.

On Thursday, I joined my fellow Senators in taking an oath to be impartial, to abide by our country&#8217;s values, and to uphold our Constitution.  This is a somber moment for our country, and I will approach this grave responsibility with the thoughtfulness and thoroughness that the people of New Hampshire expect and that the Constitution demands.&nbsp;  To fulfill that responsibility, I will continue calling for a fair and thorough trial that ensures that Senators &#151;and the American people &#151; have full access to all relevant information and facts. I hope that my Republican colleagues will join me in supporting a fair trial, including hearing from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the President&#8217;s actions, in particular Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.&nbsp;  As this trial proceeds, Congress should continue to work on the issues that I hear from Granite Staters about every day, which is why I was pleased that the Senate voted this week on a bipartisan basis to advance the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). I voted to pass this critical agreement earlier this month as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, and now that it has passed the full Senate it will head to the President&#8217;s desk for his final signature.  I supported this bipartisan deal because it will help to level the playing field for New Hampshire businesses and consumers, support our small businesses and dairy farmers, and cut red tape for our businesses. Additionally, it includes key labor and environmental enforcement standards.  I will keep working with members of both parties on critical priorities to expand opportunity for all Granite Staters and all Americans.  With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On The Senate passed bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Senator Hassan to help ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to curb the opioid epidemic and better target fentanyl and similar synthetic drugs, which have contributed to the devastating substance misuse epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country.

Senator Hassan led a bipartisan group of her colleagues in introducing a bipartisan bill to help state and local entities prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats by requiring the Department of Homeland Security to establish a Cybersecurity State Coordinator in New Hampshire and all 50 states.

Senator Hassan, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management, voted to confirm Peter Gaynor as the next Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Photo of the Week&nbsp; This week, Senator Hassan visited Rockingham Brewing Company in Derry, where she had the chance to tour the facility and speak to local brewers about the recent federal extension of craft beverage tax cuts that she successfully advocated for. This craft beverage tax cut extension will help New Hampshire&#8217;s small breweries continue to thrive, and Senator Hassan is continuing to advocate for a permanent extension of these tax cuts.

Safe travels back to the Natural State!  The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including a Resolution to approve a request from the Department of Veterans Affairs to pursue a pilot program to increase veteran access to dental care (H. J. Res. 80), the Homeless Assistance Act (), the Prudential Regulator Oversight Act (), the Expanding Opportunity for Minority Depository Institutions Act (), the Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience Act (), the President George H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act (), the 8-K Trading Gap Act (H.R. 4335), which requires the SEC to issue new rules prohibiting executives from trading during the four-day gap between when a significant event that impacts the company happens and when the company publicly files a Form 8-K to alert the public and shareholders of the event, the Veteran HOUSE Act (), a Resolution appointing and authorizing managers for the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, President of the United States (), the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (), and a Resolution providing for Congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to \"Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability\" (). Unfair trade practices and policies have allowed countries to win on the backs of hardworking Americans. For decades, China and many other players have taken advantage of the United States. The result has been jobs moved overseas, stolen intellectual property, currency manipulation, limited market access, and lost opportunity.  That changed when President Trump took office. One of his top priorities is to put America first and secure fair and reciprocal trade deals. He made clear that having a seat at the table isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; we need to be leading on issues that matter to the United States. And, this week, a momentous step was taken as the President signed Phase One of a historic trade agreement with China. With the advancement of this deal, we are righting wrongs that have hurt U.S. businesses, farmers, and families &#8211; and securing a more prosperous future for our exceptional nation. This fully enforceable agreement rebalances our vital trade partnership with China and boosts opportunity for American businesses, farmers, manufacturers, and innovators.&nbsp;Key provisions include:   American-made products: China has pledged to increase imports of American goods and services by at least $200 billion. &nbsp; Agriculture purchases: China will be purchasing billions of dollars' worth of goods from U.S. farmers. Market access: Decreased barriers for U.S. products, including beef, pork, rice, wheat, dairy, and more. No more forced technology transfers: For the first time ever, China agreed to end its practice of forcing American companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition for doing business there. Fairer currency practices: Beijing has agreed to stronger commitments on its practices regarding currency devaluations and exchange rates.  This isn&#8217;t the only recent trade win for our nation. Thanks to the President and the diligent work of U.S trade representatives, China reopened its markets to poultry &#8211; which was shuttered for years &#8211; and we have negotiated fairer policies with Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Canada. On top of that, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the critical USMCA passed the Senate this week and is now headed to the White House for signature! This agreement with Mexico and Canada provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity with two of our top trading partners. With a roaring economy and new trade deals with global partners, it&#8217;s evident now more than ever that pro-growth policies and strong leadership are ushering in a new era of prosperity, success, and growth.  Unfortunately, the concentration on delivering tangible results to the American people is not a priority shared by all of my colleagues. While President Trump signed the Phase One trade deal, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was handing out pens and posing for pictures smiling as she initialed documents to send articles of impeachment to the Senate. The contrast in agendas between parties couldn&#8217;t be more clear than those two images. As President Trump and Republicans fight to deliver wins to U.S. families, workers, farmers, and consumers, the Democrats remain transfixed with trying to remove a duly-elected President. Imagine the progress that could be made if all of Congress were focused on issues that contribute to the strength of the U.S. In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State and have a great Arkansan testify before the House Budget Committee. It was my distinct honor and privilege to welcome Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) Secretary Larry Walther to speak at a hearing titled &#8220;Why Federal Investments Matter: Stability from Congress to State Capitals.&#8221; Secretary Walther brought perspectives on Arkansas&#8217;s budget and planning processes, including the state&#8217;s focus on fiscal responsibility. As he noted, &#8220;Arkansas maintains a true balanced budget approach to funding state programs. We do not commit state dollars until we have those dollars in hand and available to spend.\" This focus on fiscal responsibility is something that Washington could use more of. The power dynamic between the federal government and state and local governments has become greatly skewed, overly dominated by federal control, and far out of line from what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The point is that state and local governments, along with private sector innovation, are best equipped to address domestic needs. The federal government should focus on finding more opportunities to stay out of the way.  At the hearing, . It is in the best interest of all to promote policies that reduce the federal imprint on state and local governments and encourage these institutions to address an increasing number of our nation&#8217;s domestic policy concerns. One-size-fits-all policies from bureaucrats sitting here in Washington do little to solve problems or address needs in Arkansas&#8217;s Third Congressional District or any other location far outside the Beltway. I thank Secretary Walther for his testimony and time.  I then sat down with Ferra Aerospace, an advanced machining and complex assembly company that is opening a facility in Rogers. Ferra's Arkansas facility will provide services to many leading companies including Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. I am thrilled that Ferra Aerospace is establishing a precision manufacturing facility in the Third District. The engineering and manufacturing talent in our region is second to none, and it&#8217;s notable that this global aerospace company is expanding into the Natural State. I welcome Ferra and its leadership to Rogers and look forward to working together to create jobs, grow the local economy, and support our military and defense industries. I wrapped up the week by sitting down with Brynt Parmeter, Walmart&#8217;s new Senior Director of Military Programs. Walmart is committed to supporting service members and their families, providing strong military spouse programs and veteran hiring commitments.&nbsp;Since launching&nbsp;the Military Spouse Career Connection (MSCC) on Veterans Day 2018, Walmart has hired more than 14,000 military spouses and remains ahead of schedule to meet its goal of hiring 250,000 military veterans by the end of 2020. Leadership, integrity, and commitment to service make our veterans outstanding employees. I&#8217;m pleased that many companies in AR-3 make it a priority to help service members transition back into civilian life and find new careers that leverage their skills.  Wishing you a great weekend, and I hope to see you around the Third District next week!

The new year brings us an opportunity to renew discussions and put forward policy that addresses the real needs of the American people such as healthcare reform. Every place I&#8217;ve gone throughout our district, I&#8217;ve been told stories about how our current healthcare system is failing Missourians, from the rising cost of prescription drugs and the lack of transparency in medical prices, to the grave concerns Missourians have on proposals like Medicare for All. My constituents have made these concerns absolutely clear. Over the next several weeks, I want to take the opportunity to discuss different ideas and policy proposals that address these great burdens facing many Missourians. This week, I want to discuss H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, a bill that helps make healthcare more affordable, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs and protecting pre-existing coverage.    H.R. 19, which includes nearly 50 reforms supported by both Republicans and Democrats, also caps the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Our bill also includes a &#8220;smoothing out&#8221; mechanism that would allow seniors to distribute their out-of-pocket expenses throughout the year. A core element of H.R. 19 is fostering competition in the market to drive down the cost of prescription drugs and spur innovation. For example, H.R. 19 allows more generic drugs to come into the market and compete with the big players, preventing &#8220;big pharma&#8221; from manipulating the market and keeping generic equivalent medicines from people who need them the most. Americans from all walks of life are experiencing the challenges of rising health care costs. It is a bipartisan problem that impacts everyone &#8211; Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, and is an issue where we must all come together in order to solve.&nbsp; While there are still many aspects of health care reform that need to be addressed, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, is a good start to achieving affordability of our healthcare.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________ These past weeks have been very good on the trade front with the United States Senate passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which passed the House of Representatives last month with my support. President Trump and his administration also took a step forward in improving our trading relationship with China, signing this week Phase I of the trade deal with China.      Ambassador Robert Lighthizer after a presentation before Members of Congress on the USMCA  I&#8217;m incredibly happy to see all the progress on trade being made by President Trump, Trade Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the entire Trump administration. Trade is paramount to our economy, our farmers and small businesses, American manufacturers, and every American family. With over 95 percent of the world&#8217;s population living outside our borders, we need to do everything possible to expand opportunities to sell more American products to consumers in other nations. It is also important that trade agreements be fair and up-to-date in today&#8217;s business environment. Passage of the USMCA and the signing of Phase I trade deal with China accomplishes this and moves us forward as a nation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________  On Wednesday, the University of Missouri announced that it would cut its relationship with the Chinese-funded Confucius Institute. For over a year, I have been meeting with officials at both the University of Missouri and Columbia Public Schools to express my concerns with the Confucius Institute. I applaud the University of Missouri&#8217;s decision to end its ties with this Chinese-government run program. Confucius Institutes serve as a critical component of the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s soft power propaganda campaign and are often praised by party officials as a major source of influence abroad to ultimately advance their world power agenda. Some Confucius Institutes have also been used as a source of research espionage threatening our national defense. I have been pleased that since&nbsp;meeting with university and school officials, oversight mechanisms have been implemented. While the impetus for cancelling the Mizzou program was new requirements from the State Department which imposed new costs on the University, the decision to end the program is welcomed and protects academic integrity and the security of our nation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________  Last Thursday, I appeared on Fox News to discuss the tensions between the United States and Iran. The Iranian regime has a long history of hostility, which has taken a multitude of American lives. Appeasing a tyrant will not stop him; bold action will. I am grateful Soleimani will no longer be plotting evil on innocent civilians who yearn for freedom. Qassem Soleimani, who was one of the chief architects of Iran&#8217;s hostile military strategy targeting American forces and undermining our security interests in the region, was invariably a tyrant. Over 600 American families had an empty place at their holiday gatherings this year due to the calculated attacks ordered by Soleimani. He was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and was intent on committing further attacks against our men and women in uniform. When President Trump learned Soleimani was orchestrating further attacks and more American lives were at stake, he took bold and decisive action. This was a strategic course of action to prevent more American casualties at the hands of the Iranian regime. The world is a safer place as a result. Click on the video below to watch my full interview with Fox News&#8217; Trace Gallagher:    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________  Earlier this month, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), on which I sit, issued its annual China Report. The analysis produced by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China highlights a disturbing trend under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. The rule of law in China continues to deteriorate, human rights abuses are worsening, and the Communist Party is projecting total and complete control over its citizens. Simply put, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is committing crimes against humanity.    The CPP also continues their coercive population control methods. Local family planning officials are instructed to conduct IUD insertions, abortions, and sterilization to prevent and control &#8220;illegal pregnancies.&#8221; Families who violate China&#8217;s &#8220;two child policy,&#8221; face heavy fines, job termination, and forced abortion, which is often referred to as a &#8220;remedial measure&#8221; for unsanctioned pregnancies. China&#8217;s coercive population control policies, and its preference for males, are human rights violations that are fueling other dangerous practices such as human trafficking and illegal adoptions.

District Update Residents of MO-4 are aware that there are so many good people working and making a difference in our district&#8217;s communities. But it&#8217;s always great to get the recognition from someone outside the district. The Milken Family Foundation, which recognizes the outstanding work of K-12 educators, annually honors between 20 and 30 teachers, principals, and school administrators across the country. Winners each receive recognition and a $25,000 award. Missouri had one of this year&#8217;s winners &#8211; Melissa Fike, a math teacher at Oakland Middle School in Columbia. She was surprised to hear her name announced as the winner during a school assembly attended by Oakland&#8217;s students and staff. The Milken Family Foundation Award has been called &#8220;the Oscars of Teaching.&#8221; Congratulations to Melissa Fike for her great work making a difference in the lives of so many young people.    Oakland Middle School math teacher was shocked to hear her name announced as a Milken Family Foundation Teacher of the Year (Photo courtesy of Milken Foundation) Constituent Update I love to share good news about our successes in helping constituents who are having difficulty dealing with federal government agencies or departments. Casework Manager Janna Worsham recently helped a veteran who had been receiving Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and Concurrent Retirement Disability Pay (CRDP). Mistakes happen, and the VA withheld part of this veteran&#8217;s compensation. After Janna looked into the problem and worked things out with the VA, the veteran was compensated for the amount that was deducted and is once again receiving the benefits he has earned. If you&#8217;re a veteran who has an issue with the VA or any other agency, give Janna a call in our Columbia office at 573-442-9311 and she&#8217;ll do all she can to help.

President Trump put us on a perilous path that remains fraught with tension and places the more than 65,000 military servicemembers and embassy staff in the region at grave risk. It all goes back to his heedlessly petty withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal&#8212;which was working&#8212;and the alienation of our longstanding allies and partners. When Iran lashed out in response, Trump doubled down and killed a senior Iranian leader, setting off Iran&#8217;s latest retaliation and galvanizing&nbsp; people in the region against the U.S. who had, until just last week, been demonstrating against the regime.&nbsp;The question everyone should be asking is whether the President's rash foreign policy decision, and his presidency overall, have made us more safe. The&nbsp;answer is no.  That is why I proudly joined 224 of my colleagues, including several&nbsp;Republicans, who voted to reassert Congress' constitutional war powers to prevent further escalation of&nbsp;a conflict that the American people do not want. Our message was clear: The Constitution gives Congress, and only Congress, the power to declare war.  That was far from the only business conducted in the House, as you will see below. My colleagues&nbsp;and I took action on limiting PFAS chemical exposure, though there is far more that must be done to address this public health threat. We also&nbsp;voted to&nbsp;advance 5G technology to keep America globally competitive. And we continued to fight against Senator Mitch McConnell's and President Trump's joint&nbsp;scheme to undermine the Senate impeachment trial process and keep&nbsp;the&nbsp;facts of the President's&nbsp;misconduct and corruption hidden from the American people.  Next week&nbsp;will&nbsp;be just as busy so make sure&nbsp;you check out&nbsp;the next Jackie's DC Dashboard.

This bipartisan vote sends a strong message to President Trump that we will not tolerate dangerous foreign policy whims that cannot be justified as \"imminent.\"   Like so many of you who have reached out in the wake of this escalation, I remain deeply concerned for the safety of more than 65,000 Americans stationed in the region as well as the security of the nation. We are less safe than we were two years ago and the President&nbsp;cannot be trusted to continue managing the crisis he created. I hope that our Republican colleagues in the Senate will respect Congress&#8217;s constitutional authority on this matter and do what is right.  Impeachment Update: Standoff Between Chambers on Trial Rules With our return to session this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued to hold the articles of impeachment that the House approved in December and that accuse the President of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Before sending over the articles to initiate the Senate trial, Speaker Pelosi has rightly insisted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put forward fair trial rules that include subpoenaing documents and testimony from witnesses. Sen. McConnell wants to avoid a full and fair trial at all costs because it would expose even more details about the corrupt and treacherous schemes of President Trump. To that end, Sen. McConnell has been working closely with the White House to rig the trial for an easy acquittal. This is a travesty and makes a mockery of the Constitution and the Senate Rules that require Senators to swear an oath to be impartial jurors that states, . It&#8217;s an oath Sen. McConnell and other Republicans have violated before the trial even begins by colluding with the defendant. Since the House vote in December, further evidence has come to light underscoring the need for subpoenaed witnesses and documents to be presented at the Senate trial to ensure a fair process that provides the American people with the truth. First, it was revealed that documents produced by the Administration in response to court orders redacted the most incriminating emails&#8212;the textbook definition of a &#8220;coverup.&#8221; And former National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that he would testify at the Senate trial if a subpoena were issued, to provide us with new information about President Trump&#8217;s interactions with Ukraine. President Trump initially said would be up to the Senate to determine witnesses, but then indicated that he would seek to block Bolton&#8217;s testimony. Please know&nbsp;that my Democratic colleagues and I will not&nbsp;give up on our search for the truth&nbsp;and congressional oversight duties.  Voted to Regulate Harmful &#8220;Forever Chemicals&#8221; and Protect Consumers This week, the House took long-overdue action to regulate PFAS, a class of thousands of chemicals that accumulate in the environment and in our bodies. In spite of extensive evidence that PFAS are associated with adverse health impacts, the EPA has failed to take meaningful regulatory action to protect Americans and their families. While servicemembers and communities located near military facilities are particularly at risk of PFAS exposure, the CDC estimates that a staggering 98 percent of the US population already have PFAS in their blood. On Thursday, I voted to take an important first step toward addressing this&nbsp;contamination with the PFAS Action Act of 2019. This groundbreaking legislation would force the EPA to set a safe drinking water limit for PFAS that takes into consideration particularly vulnerable populations. It would also designate PFAS as a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; under the SUPERFUND law, a tool for cleaning up contaminated sites and ensuring that polluters bear responsibility for the brunt of remedial costs. Critically, this legislation also contains provisions to promote accountability from chemical manufacturers, ensure transparency for consumers, and support communities with contaminated water sources. If passed by the Senate, the PFAS Action Act will go a long way toward addressing PFAS pollution in our water and air. However, we&nbsp;must still fight to ensure that common household items such as cookware, food wrappings, and personal care items like cosmetics and sunscreen are PFAS free and safe for consumers!  Voted to Advance 5G Communications Infrastructure and Security On Wednesday, I voted in favor of a package of bills addressing the advancements of fifth-generation (5G) technologies &#8211; the future of the global telecommunications market. China has taken great efforts to advance their 5G networks and it&#8217;s imperative for the United States to do the same and then some. This package of bills will help ensure adherence to international security recommendations adopted at the Prague 5G Security Conference, develop a 5G security strategy in consultation with our intelligence community, and support U.S. leadership at international 5G standards-setting bodies. Congress must ensure that America remains a global leader for new technologies and I will continue to work so that our District &#8211; in the heart of Silicon Valley &#8211; continues to set the trends and be ahead of the curve.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Oversight Hearing on Census Efforts to Reach Hard-to-Count Communities On Thursday, in the Oversight Committee, I heard from public advocacy groups on the preparedness of the 2020 Census, and the Census Bureau&#8217;s efforts to reach hard-to-count communities. The Census is crucial to distributing over $1.5 trillion a year in federal support for housing, health care, education, and so much more that is needed to build strong communities.   Instead of dedicating efforts to ensuring an accurate count, this Administration frittered away years in an effort to bias the count and silence immigrant communities with a citizenship question. Because they failed to focus on the job at hand, they now are playing catch-up to hire census employees and engage in outreach necessary for a full and accurate count. The silver lining of Thursday&#8217;s hearing was the testimony of civic advocates engaged in grassroots efforts to reach hard-to-count communities and make sure they are counted. The House Oversight Committee will continue to engage in oversight of the Census Bureau to pressure them to do their job and get an accurate count.    Meetings with Jackie Congressional Offices Implementing the #MeToo Congress Act This week, I met with leadership of the Office of Employee Advocacy and Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which is responsible for helping to ensure legislative branch employees&#8217; rights are respected and the dispute resolution process is fair. I heard an update on implementation of the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) Reform Act, which was based on my #MeToo Congress Act to finally rein in the scourge of harassment and discrimination in the halls of Congress.&nbsp;  I was pleased to hear that the new Office of Employee Advocacy, which now provides legal advice and representation to complainants, is being utilized and well-received by employees and that Office of Congressional Workplace Rights changes are coming along smoothly. I will continue to conduct oversight and push for change so that all employees may benefit from the safe and respectful workplaces they deserve.  Economic Gains From Women's Equality in Nordic Countries  Women&#8217;s equality is not just a moral good, it makes economic sense. Swedish Ambassador Karin Olofsdotter attributed 20 percent of Sweden&#8217;s GDP growth to women&#8217;s increased labor force participation. Research shows that when women have the tools to succeed and there is greater gender equality in societies, those societies are more peaceful and prosperous. The United States has a long way to go and lots of opportunities for growth on women&#8217;s equality. Rest assured that I won&#8217;t stop fighting until our policies unleash the power of women and girls.    Voices of California's 14th District  Here are some issues constituents raised this week:&nbsp; &#8226; 628 constituents expressed grave concern for the hostilities between the United States and Iran after the lethal airstrike near the Baghdad airport that killed Major General Qassem Soleimani. I strongly agree with your concerns and believe this strike constitutes the Trump Administration&#8217;s biggest and most consequential foreign policy blunder to date and proudly joined my colleagues this week in voting for the War Powers resolution. &#8226; 45 constituents shared support for the Endangered Species Act. I am proud to have a long record of support for animal and wildlife conservation and have signed multiple letters to the Administration supporting the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and wildlife conservation programs. Recent efforts to derail the ESA are part of a greater trend of politically-motivated assault on science and the environment. You have my word that I will fight against these efforts and work to safeguard our wildlife conservation laws.&nbsp;&#8226; 25 constituents expressed support for gun violence prevention. As a survivor and a Vice-Chair on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I am deeply committed to doing everything within my power to strengthen our nation's woefully inadequate gun safety laws and will not back down until Congress passes meaningful gun violence prevention solutions.

This week, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I voted to advance the bipartisan U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) agreement, which will make important upgrades to the previous trade deal between our three countries, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  In evaluating any trade deal, including the USMCA, I use two key benchmarks. First, trade deals must help level the playing field for innovative businesses trying to compete in the global economy. Second, trade deals must contain strong enforcement mechanisms to protect workers, consumers, and the environment. After carefully considering the provisions and listening to businesses and people across our state, I believe that the bipartisan USMCA meets both of those standards.  This trade deal is especially important for New Hampshire businesses because Canada and Mexico are two of New Hampshire&#8217;s leading trade partners, with our businesses exporting more than $1 billion in products to our North American neighbors.  In particular, I am pleased that the agreement boosts the ability of New Hampshire businesses to compete in the global economy, cuts red tape and tariffs for small exporters, and removes long-standing trade barriers that have hurt dairy farmers in New Hampshire.  Additionally, thanks to the good-faith efforts of both Democratic and Republican negotiators, the USMCA has strong labor and environmental enforcement provisions.  I hope that that the USMCA will move to the Senate floor without delay so that it can be approved and implemented as soon as possible. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll keep working with my colleagues from both parties to push for strong and comprehensive trade deals that support our economy and give our businesses and consumers long-term certainty.

Read more here.    It was great to join Granite State Progress and Riverbend Community Mental Health on Monday to discuss how Congress is fighting to lower the cost of prescription drugs and combat the opioid epidemic. I appreciate the opportunity to hear from folks in our community and to discuss the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which we passed in the House in December. This legislation takes an important step toward easing the burden so many Americans face when choosing between the prescriptions they rely on and making ends meet. I was also glad to discuss the inclusion of $10 billion I helped secure in this legislation to combat substance misuse in the Granite State and nationwide. The Senate should act on this legislation immediately so that everyone can afford the medications they need.  Combating PFAS Contamination&nbsp;  Today, the House passed the PFAS Action Act of 2019 to help ensure that all Americans have access to clean and safe water free of dangerous &#8220;forever chemicals.&#8221; We know that PFAS chemicals pose a serious threat to the health and wellbeing of communities in New Hampshire and across the country, and this commonsense measure will help ensure that the water Americans consume and use on a daily basis is safe. I was proud to see language from my bill, the Protecting Communities from New PFAS Act, to turn off the tap for new PFAS chemicals making their way through the EPA approval process, was included in this legislation. I encourage the Senate to bring this commonsense measure swiftly to a vote.        Speaking on the floor about PFAS legislation. Watch here.    Keeping Americans Safe &amp; Preventing an Unnecessary War   As a Member of Congress, my first responsibility is to keep New Hampshire families and the American people safe. This week, I voted for a War Powers Resolution to protect our national security and prevent the United States from entering an unnecessary war in the Middle East. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. This is a decision that should be made by the people &#8211; not one person.&nbsp;  I am relieved that no American or allied forces were harmed in Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile attack targeting U.S. forces in Iraq on Tuesday night, and I strongly condemn Iran&#8217;s actions. There is no question that Qassem Soleimani had American blood on his hands, and I agree with the President that his victims deserve justice. However, I am deeply concerned by the Trump Administration&#8217;s decision to engage in hostilities in Iran without consulting Congress and without a clear strategy moving forward. Now is the time to pause and take a step back to engage in diplomacy and re-open constructive discussions that will de-escalate tensions in the region. We are stronger when we work together &#8211; I urge President Trump to work with Congress to advance a de-escalatory strategy to prevent further violence and protect Americans at home and abroad. Improving Child and Maternal Care        With my great-niece Lia    In 2018, my family lost my great-niece Lia to Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) before her first birthday. Our loss was felt by the 62 Granite State families who also lost an infant to a sleep-related death, like SUID, between 2011 and 2018. On Wednesday, I shared Lia&#8217;s story as my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues and I spoke with experts to explore how we can prevent unexpected and unexplained deaths among infants and children. Our family will never be the same without our Lia, but I will keep fighting to improve child and maternal care to prevent families from losing a precious young one unexpectedly. Watch my full remarks here.&nbsp;  Here for You   As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by a constituent from Salem, who had an issue of concern regarding Social Security Disability benefits. My staff worked with the Social Security Administration and helped resolve the constituent&#8217;s issue.

I wish every constituent a new year filled with many blessings.  Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week  Voted YES on War Powers Resolution   The House voted to require President Trump to immediately terminate military operations against Iran. The President has taken our nation to the brink of war without properly consulting Congress or seeking the legal authority to do so. Only Congress can authorize military action under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. To add insult to injury, the Trump Administration has failed to fully explain to Congress and the American people what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the United States that required the strike to take out General Soleimani. You can watch my remarks on the war powers resolution here.  Attended Classified Briefing on Iran by Administration Officials  On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire briefed the full House of Representatives in a classified setting on Iran. Members asked tough questions, but the Administration failed to share any actionable intelligence that the attack was based on. Specifically, they could not answer what the &#8216;imminent threat&#8217; was that compelled them to undertake the strike.  Hearing on Improving Health Care Coverage and Outcomes    As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine seven bills to improve health outcomes for kids and strengthen benefits and coverage for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We examined:   Legislation to extend Medicare coverage of post-transplant drugs for kidney transplant recipients. Currently, Medicare only covers necessary drugs to prevent kidney failure for 36 months. This legislation is projected to save 375 kidney transplants a year;   Legislation to provide funding to advance the study and prevention of Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood (SUDC). This is the death of a child over the age of 12 months that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation and autopsy;   Legislation to award grants to schools to encourage better allergy and asthma treatment;   Legislation to improve birth outcomes in high-risk communities through increased funding for mothers;   Legislation that requires health plans to cover medically-necessary treatments related to a patient&#8217;s birth defects, congenital disorders, or congenital malformations;   Legislation that updates the Part B enrollment process for the first time in 50 years, protecting Medicare beneficiaries from a lifetime of financial penalties because of a failure to enroll promptly in Part B;   Legislation that requires states to offer a non-emergency medical transportation benefit to Medicaid beneficiaries, ensuring 70 million low-income and disabled individuals have reliable transportation to access the care they need. This would be a godsend to so many people in our country!  To watch my opening statement, click here.  Voted YES on the PFAS Action Act of 2019  Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (referred to as PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals found in many commercial products.&nbsp; These chemicals have strong chemical bonds and do not break down easily in the environment, causing them to accumulate in humans and wildlife. PFAS have long been linked with adverse health effects including cancer, immune system effects, infertility, impaired child development, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease. The House passed the PFAS Action Act which requires the cleanup of sites contaminated with PFAS; the monitoring for PFAS in drinking water; and the creation of new standards to limit further human and environmental exposure to PFAS.  Voted YES on the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020  According to a 2018 North Atlantic Treaty Organization&nbsp;report, Huawei&#8217;s influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations.&nbsp;The House passed the Secure 5G and Beyond Act to require the Administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems. This strategy must also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies without sacrificing reliable internet access.  Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act  Aviation currently accounts for approximately three percent of the nation&#8217;s total greenhouse gas emissions, and the emission rates are expected to triple by 2050. The Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act bolsters NASA&#8217;s efforts to reduce emissions from aviation, while also reducing the impact of airplane noise. Specifically, this bill:   Establishes a goal of commercial airplanes emitting 50 percent less greenhouse gas and 50 percent less noise compared to 2019 levels by 2030 for regional planes and 2040 for larger, single-aisle planes;   Authorizes NASA to accelerate its work on electrified propulsion systems to achieve noise and emissions reductions;   Challenges NASA to work with industry partners to carry out flight tests by 2025 and to bring new airplanes into service between 2030 and 2040; and   Requires NASA to provide guidance on new technologies to help the FAA&#8217;s work to ensure the safe and effective deployment of these technologies.  Horse Transportation Safety Act  Transporting horses in double-deck trailers is often dangerous because they do not provide enough headroom for horses to stand upright. The livestock often endure long journeys in cramped positions and sustain serious injuries as a result. To address this problem, the bipartisan Horse Transportation Safety Act prohibits the transportation of horses in interstate commerce in a motor vehicle containing two or more levels stacked on top of one another.  Weekly Highlights  Congressional App Challenge Winner   It was a pleasure to visit Saratoga High School to announce the winner of the 2019 Congressional App Challenge for California&#8217;s 18th Congressional District, Sidney Hough. Sidney&#8217;s app, Uproot, prevents heavy crop losses by identifying invasive plants. Using machine learning and artificial intelligence, Uproot analyzes photos of plants in real-time to detect growth that is harmful to crops. Congratulations to Sidney, and bravo to the 16 Challenge participants for pursuing innovative technology to create meaningful change.  I co-chair the Congressional Internet Caucus, which hosts the Congressional App Challenge. The Challenge is a bipartisan, nationwide competition and is comprised of high school students from all participating congressional districts that compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or &#8220;app,&#8221; for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice. The competition is designed to promote innovation and engagement in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education fields. Students can learn more about the annual Congressional App Challenge here.&nbsp;  In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. In this new year, over 2,500 constituents have already contacted me. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me. This week, 1,289 constituents contacted our office about issues including:   209 constituents wrote to me about the military strike in Iran   187 constituents wrote to me in support of the&nbsp;PFAS Action Act   156 constituents wrote to me about impeachment  Anna&#8217;s Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from.

The bill was signed into law on December 30th. I&#8217;ve advocated for over a decade to protect the public from unwanted calls and I&#8217;m thrilled we passed this law to bring relief to the American people.

Although it won&#8217;t totally solve the problem, it should help. Let me know if unsolicited calls have become a serious issue for you.&nbsp;  Vern   Trump signs robo-call bill into law Caroline Kelly  President Donald Trump signed a bill on Monday that increases fines on criminal robocall violations and cracks down on companies making the calls, as part of a federal push against telephone scammers.  \"This historic legislation will provide American consumers with even greater protection against annoying unsolicited robocalls,\" the White House Office of the Press Secretary said of the TRACED Act.&nbsp;  \"American families deserve control over their communications, and this legislation will update our laws and regulations to stiffen penalties, increase transparency, and enhance government collaboration to stop unwanted solicitation.\"  The move comes as part of crackdown against the targeting companies and individuals who have collectively placed more than 1 billion unwanted calls for financial schemes and other services.&nbsp;  Monday's bill, which passed in the Senate in May and the House earlier this month, came following the Federal Communications Commission's announcement of a nationwide crackdown on illegal robocalls in June.  The legislation imposes stiffer fines of as much as $10,000 per call on robocallers who knowingly flout the rules on calls and instructs the FCC to develop further regulations that could shield consumers from unwanted calls. It will also accelerate the rollout of so-called \"call authentication\" technologies the industry is currently developing, which could cut down on the number of calls coming from unverified numbers.  Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and cosponsor of the bill, pointed to its bipartisan support in a statement earlier this month anticipating the President's signature.  \"I have yet to meet someone who says they enjoy receiving those unwanted and illegal robocalls that plague our phones, whether we're at home, at work, or in the car, which is why the TRACED Act takes several important steps in the fight to curb this scourge,\" he said. He called the measure \"a significant win for consumers in every corner of the country, and it finally and officially puts illegal robocallers on notice.\"  Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey said that, by passing the legislation, the Senate \"sent Americans a holiday gift on everyone's list: stopping the plague of robocalls.\"  \"The annoying and harassing robocalls we receive every day are neither a Democrat nor Republican menace; they are a universal menace,\" he added.  The law isn't the only measure being taken to target the calls. The FCC voted in June to give wireless carriers like Verizon the green light to block unwanted robocalls automatically for all customers. In August, 12 of the nation's largest telecommunications companies and attorneys general from all 50 states plus Washington, DC, announced a voluntary agreement to prevent and punish illegal robocallers.           &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

As the area continues to recover from the effects of the Eagle Creek Fire, these funds are all the more important and&nbsp;I am glad that the President signed this into law.&nbsp;   Cross-river and cross-aisle federal business development grants directed at Eagle Creek fire damage recovery&nbsp;  A bipartisan press release from federal legislators from Oregon and Washington:&nbsp;Oregon&#8217;s Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), and Representative Greg Walden (R-OR-2), recently announced that the 2020 spending bill passed by Congress will include $2 million in new funding for rural business development grants, with priority given to National Scenic Areas that have been devastated by wildfires, such as the Columbia River Gorge.&nbsp; &nbsp; Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read more from the Hood River News.&nbsp;  Providing for&nbsp;our Rural Communities&nbsp;  Our rural electric cooperatives should not get punished when they receive broadband buildout grants or emergency recovery funding.&nbsp;Yet, because of a drafting error in prior legislation, that&#8217;s precisely what would happen.&nbsp;Thankfully,&nbsp;President Trump signed&nbsp;into law&nbsp;the Rural Act, a bill I co-sponsored that would&nbsp;help keep electric costs affordable and expand access to broadband in rural Oregon.&nbsp;This&nbsp;fix is essential to&nbsp;ensuring cooperatives and other consumer-owned utilities can continue doing their good work across the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also helped the House pass&nbsp;into law&nbsp;full funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program.&nbsp;Full funding for PILT keeps an important commitment to rural counties in Oregon.&nbsp;The federal government controls&nbsp;much of&nbsp;the land in our district and these funds help to make up for lost property tax revenue and help counties provide basic services such as roads and law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In continuation of Congress&#8217; efforts to support rural communities, we also extended funding for the Secure Rural Schools (SRS)&nbsp;program&nbsp;for 2019 and 2020.&nbsp;Secure Rural Schools funding helps Oregon&#8217;s forested communities pay for essential services like schools, roads, and law enforcement.&nbsp;SRS has never replaced the dramatic reduction in federal timber revenue&nbsp;lost&nbsp;over the last 30 years, but it does provide some level of support. Last year, we passed the most significant reform to forest policy in a decade to help improve the management of our forests. While this is progress toward reversing the decades-long decline in timber revenue, an extension of SRS is needed to ensure counties have a safety net as we work to further improve forest management and utilize our natural resources to provide sustainable jobs and revenue to Oregon&#8217;s rural communities.&nbsp;  Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs&nbsp; &nbsp;  In December, I introduced&nbsp;the Lower Costs, More Cures Act&nbsp;which would help lower the price of prescription drugs and insulin.&nbsp;&nbsp;My legislation would ensure that Americans can see reductions in the cost of their pharmaceutical drugs and that we won&#8217;t get in the way of new innovations to save peoples' lives.&nbsp;We need to incentivize innovation and develop more cures, but we also need to tackle the bad behavior by pharmaceutical companies when they stop generics from coming to the market and block access to some of these newer drugs that would bring down the cost&nbsp;of prescription drugs.&nbsp;    Click&#8239;here&#8239;or on the image above to watch Rep. Walden's video announcement.&nbsp;   Walden wants to lower prescription costs&nbsp; &nbsp;  U.S. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Hood River) hopes 2020 brings passage of his Lower Costs, More Cures Act. He said the proposed bill would lower prescription costs without cutting into important medical research.&nbsp;&#8220;This is all designed to stop bad behavior by pharmaceutical companies and bring down the cost of drugs, but not do so in a way that upends the whole effort of revolutionizing medicine with new cures,&#8221; Walden said.&nbsp; &nbsp; Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read more from My Columbia Basin.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stopping Illegal Robocalls&nbsp; &nbsp;  Last year in the 541-area code, roughly 162.9 million robocalls were placed.&nbsp;On the&nbsp;second to last&nbsp;day of 2019,&nbsp;President Trump signed into law a bill I helped author, the TRACED Act, which will put an end to illegal robocalls.&nbsp;The legislation will give phone companies and the government new tools to help combat robocalls. The bipartisan law puts consumers first, enabling menacing robocalls to be blocked at no extra cost to the consumer.&nbsp;Now that this bill is law,&nbsp;I will remain vigilant in ensuring&nbsp;it is&nbsp;properly implemented and that&nbsp;Oregonians&nbsp;are protected from menacing robocalls.  Expanding Rural Broadband&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  At the end of 2019, the House passed two bills I co-sponsored that would help improve and expand access to rural broadband in Oregon. These bills&nbsp;would help improve broadband mapping, which will allow us to better understand exactly where communities are that still lack access to high speed internet. These bills will help strengthen connectivity in America and lessen the urban/rural digital divide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, I brought the&nbsp;Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman&nbsp;Ajit&nbsp;Pai&nbsp;out to eastern Oregon to discuss efforts to improve connectivity in rural communities, including making sure patients in remote areas have access to the best doctors through technology like&nbsp;telehealth.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;recently&nbsp;helped secure a $6 million grant to John Day to further expand rural broadband in the region. I will continue to work to expand rural broadband and ensure that Oregonians have sufficient access to high speed internet service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Delivering for Oregon Ag&nbsp;Producers&nbsp;and Small Businesses&nbsp; &nbsp;  In December, the House came together to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) which greatly helps&nbsp;Oregon&#8217;s agricultural producers and small businesses.&nbsp;Oregon businesses export $3.7 billion in goods to Canada and Mexico, supporting 7,421 jobs in our state. This agreement expands and solidifies the market opportunities that make that possible. USMCA will especially help Oregon wine, wheat, and dairy producers and&nbsp;provide improved market access for our agriculture products. I look forward to the Senate passing and the President signing this agreement so that we can continue to grow our economy and expand access to markets abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;Taking Care of our Servicemembers&nbsp; &nbsp;  Looking ahead, I wanted to&nbsp;bring your attention to an&nbsp;issue&nbsp;I am working on fixing&nbsp;concerning our servicemembers and veterans.&nbsp;Currently, when servicemembers are medically retired, they can enroll in different versions of TRICARE,&nbsp;which is the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;military health insurance program. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;veteran is injured to&nbsp;the point of becoming eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI),&nbsp;they&nbsp;also become eligible for Medicare after 24 months.&nbsp;However, once the veteran becomes eligible for Medicare, they are no&nbsp;longer eligible for traditional TRICARE and instead become eligible for a supplement allowing access to TRICARE services called TRICARE for Life.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have access to TRICARE for Life, the veteran must enroll in Medicare Part B. If the veteran returns to work and is no longer receiving&nbsp;SSDI cash benefits, they continue to remain eligible for Medicare for 8.5 years.&nbsp;This can become a problem when a&nbsp;veteran returns&nbsp;to work but&nbsp;continues to have Medicare coverage because they cannot return to a different, more affordable, TRICARE product. In addition, since their&nbsp;SSDI payments ceased, these veterans must pay the Medicare Part B&nbsp;premiums out of pocket. Standard Medicare Part B premiums can represent over a 5-fold difference in cost, a clear disincentive to return to work for those who are able, and creates an equity issue between veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a provision in the HEARTS Act which&nbsp;allows those veterans returning to work to opt-out of Medicare Part B when&nbsp;SSDI payments cease and&nbsp;enables&nbsp;them&nbsp;to maintain TRICARE for Life even after opting-out of Part B.&nbsp;Congress could act to&nbsp;offset any costs by passing the Prostate&nbsp;Misdiagnosis&nbsp;Elimination&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some members of the Oregon Delegation have worked to prevent the Prostate Misdiagnosis Elimination Act from becoming law. It is my hope that Congress can come together in a bipartisan way to get this provision passed into law so that our veterans and servicemembers can have access to the benefits and services they deserve.&nbsp;I will be sure to keep you updated on the progress we make on this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;Ways My Office Can Help&#8239;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We recently helped a constituent&nbsp;who is a veteran&nbsp;get his disability approved. The veteran had been denied disability twice, but our office helped provide evidence of&nbsp;his&nbsp;disability. Now,&nbsp;he will receive the services and support he earned through his service.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need help with any federal agency, please reach out to my office at 800-533-3303. My staff is available and ready to assist you with problems you are having with federal agencies, and my office will do everything in our power to get results for you.  &nbsp;That&#8217;s all for this update.

In addition to participating in several high level diplomatic and military meetings, discussing a wide range of topics including the fight against ISIS in Syria&nbsp;and Iraq, Iranian aggression, trade and more, I had the honor of sharing holiday meals with our deployed service men and women, including&nbsp;106th Rescue Wing Airman Eric VanDyne from Mattituck,&nbsp;106th Rescue Wing Airman David Amerson from Mastic, and Navy Sailor Bruce Kriete from Shirley, during which we discussed how Congress can support our troops on the battlefield and when they return home.&nbsp;       Rep. Zeldin shares a holiday meal with 106th Rescue Wing Airman David Amerson from Mastic while deployed to the Middle East, thanks our troops for their service, and discusses how Congress can support them.    In a district nearly completely surrounded by water, we have a unique responsibility to safeguard our local waterways and bolster our maritime infrastructure. Since coming to Congress, I've&nbsp;worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to secure desperately needed victories for our Congressional District, whether it&#8217;s moving the Fire Island to Montauk Point plan closer to implementation or securing emergency east end projects. I provided an update on critical projects up and down the island here.&nbsp;  My amendment to halt the sale of Plum Island for 12 months was passed and signed into law.&nbsp;The current law, which mandates the sale of the island to the highest bidder, is the wrong path forward. The state-of-the-art research facility at Plum Island must not go to waste, and preserving this island&#8217;s natural beauty while maintaining a research mission will continue to provide important economic and environmental benefits to Long Island. I applaud my colleagues for adopting my amendment to halt the sale of Plum Island for 12 months and look forward to continuing to work with them in a bicameral, bipartisan fashion to pass my stand-alone, long-term legislation &#8211; the Plum Island Preservation Act - to permanently protect the island.  A little rain didn&#8217;t stop hundreds of Long Islanders from coming out to&nbsp;Calverton National Cemetery&nbsp;to honor and remember our local veterans during National Wreaths Across America Day. As we&nbsp;came&nbsp;together this holiday season with our family and friends,&nbsp;it was important to&nbsp;remember that our nation&#8217;s veterans are the reason we have the opportunity to enjoy it with our loved ones in this great nation.&nbsp;Learn more here.        Rep Zeldin joins the Support Committee at Calverton National Cemetery, Civil Air Patrol and Riverhead ROTC Cadets, and local veterans and residents for Wreaths Across America Day and to discuss how Congress can help honor our country's veterans.    I joined local officials, post office&nbsp;representatives, and the family and friends of former NY-1 Congressman Bill Carney to dedicate the Smithtown Post Office in his honor. Congressman Carney was an incredible man who fought tirelessly for his constituents everyday, and, even before his life in politics, his commitment to serving his country and community in the U.S. Army never wavered. Congressman Carney will be remembered for his strength, integrity, and commitment to his district and nation, and there is no place he loved more than Long Island. Now, every time someone enters the Congressman Bill Carney Post Office, his legacy will be remembered forever. Learn more here.&nbsp;        After ushering into law his legislation to rename the Smithtown Post Office in Congressman Carney's honor, Rep. Zeldin addresses Congressman Carney's friends and family at the dedication ceremony.    The Chairman of the FCC called on Congress to repeal the mandated sale of a vital communication tool for our local first responders known as the T-Band Spectrum, andI already introduced legislation to do just that. From hurricanes to fires, in the most dire situations, the T-band spectrum provides critical communication between first responders. Even when cell phones, internet, and electricity cease to function, T-band is the last line of defense, and selling off this spectrum would be a disservice to our nation&#8217;s first responders and the millions of Americans they serve. I urged Congress to focus on the issues most important to the American people, including the immediate passage of my legislation. Learn more here.  Did you know that over 330 million robocalls were placed last month alone in the State of New York? Unwanted and unlawful robocalls, which were once simply a nuisance, have now hijacked consumers&#8217; cell phones and undermined our entire phone system. Consumers should be able to block unwanted and illegal calls and answer their cell phones without fear of being targeted for a scam, which is why I was proud to vote YES on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bipartisan and comprehensive&nbsp;new law&nbsp;that continues to build on our efforts to end this continuous onslaught of robocalls. Learn more here.&nbsp;  The Hashamomuck Cove project received another key approval from the Army Corps. The completion of the project at Hashamomuck Cove is not only important to protecting homes and businesses, but also critical to safeguarding our infrastructure and vital evacuation routes in case of emergencies. Too often we&#8217;ve witnessed&nbsp;a weather event as simple as a thunderstorm&nbsp;at high tide cause serious flooding and property damage for local residents. Local businesses, residents, and first responders cannot afford to wait as their properties and access to Route 48 continue to be threatened, and I will continue to work closely with the Army Corps and local officials to ensure this pivotal project continues to move forward. Learn more here.  It's estimated that the ratification of USMCA will mean 176,000 new US jobs and $68 billion in new US economic growth,&nbsp;according to the United States Trade Representative, better leveling the playing field and delivering a huge win for the American worker. That's why it was critical that Congress ratified this vital deal this month, so we can continue to witness historic economic growth in 2020. Learn more here.&nbsp;  We can&#8217;t play politics when it comes to the vital prescriptions Long Islanders need, which is why I support commonsense and comprehensive legislation that would drive down the cost of these important medicines. The Lower Costs, More Cures Act makes insulin more affordable, places a cap on seniors&#8217; out-of-pocket drug costs, and&nbsp;lowers the cost of prescription drugs by promoting more low-cost options for patients and much more. Learn more here.  I spoke to the Army Corps following the latest washover on Dune Road just west of Shinnecock Inlet where many small businesses and jobs are located.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am encouraged that the Army Corps is doing everything in its power within federal law to respond quickly and effectively to this urgent matter, including expediting approvals to get sand placed as soon at legally possible. Learn more about their efforts here.&nbsp;        Rep. Zeldin and Suffolk County officials survey Dune Road and discuss&nbsp;available options regarding state and federal assistance as well as the availability of funding and needed equipment.    I hosted an important&nbsp;meeting this month with newly-sworn in&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;Administrator Stephen Dickson to fight for relief for residents whose quality of life has deteriorated due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;persistent issue of helicopter noise on the East End.&nbsp;I secured passage into law of my proposal to require the FAA to reassess the North Shore Helicopter Route, and it's time for the FAA to deliver for residents and provide&nbsp;relief. Learn more here.&nbsp;        Rep. Zeldin meets with newly appointed FAA Administrator Dickson to fight for&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;noise relief for East End residents.    Our community has witnessed the indiscriminate brutality of gang violence first-hand at the hands of MS-13, which swept into and took hold in our communities. Those at every level of government have zeroed in on combating this ruthless gang and ridding their escalating violence from our streets, as evidenced by&nbsp;this month&#8217;s&nbsp;crackdown on nearly 100 MS-13 gang members and associates in Suffolk County alone, spearheaded by county officials in collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Bureau of&nbsp;Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and other agencies.

They&#8217;re one of the few rescue squadrons in the country that use the HH-60G helicopter for their critical missions. However, ever-changing missions have demanded modern equipment, which is why the development, assembly and delivery of the new generation HH-60W is critical to the 106th and the airmen and women who serve there.

Over this past year, I&#8217;ve been standing up for Utahns - pushing back against federal overreach on issues impacting our rural counties, advocating for greater local input in public land matters, safeguarding Utah&#8217;s role in our national defense, and more. Through my committee assignments, and partnerships with colleagues, I&#8217;ve been fighting to rebuild our military, strengthen our national security, and help American families and workers.  You are my boss - your ideas guide my service in the Senate, and I am pleased to have connected with so many of you through the 15 town halls I held throughout the state, and through letters, emails, and phone calls. I hope you&#8217;ll take a moment to read on about some of these efforts, and please know that I will keep fighting for what&#8217;s best for you and for our state and nation.             Soon after being sworn into the Senate, final negotiations took place regarding a package of legislation dealing with management of our federal lands - including those in Utah. The bill, which was the product of years of collaboration between Utah county commissioners and local ranchers, recreationists, and conservationists, included the creation of 240,000 acres of wilderness and 248,000 acres of recreation areas, consolidation of Utah trust lands that will generate millions in revenue for our school kids, and local land transfers to meet city and county government needs. Former Senator Hatch, along with Congressmen Bishop and Curtis, worked hard on this legislation for many years, and I was pleased to help bring this measure over the finish line - but our work is not done. Partnering with Senator Lee, I helped introduce a bill that would require the approval of Congress and state legislatures in order for the President to designate national monuments. And I am continuing to push for more local control and input over how public lands in Utah are managed.   Hill Air Force Base plays a vital role in our country&#8217;s national security. In the end-of-year spending bill, I helped secure funding for military construction projects at Hill and funding for nearly 100 F-35s, with maintenance and repairs occurring at the base. The bill also included funding to modernize our missile defense system, managed in large part at Hill. This year also saw progress on other Utah priorities - including increased funding for management of the wild horse and burro population on rangelands, wildfire suppression and prevention resources, and reauthorization of programs that support essential services and schools in our rural counties. We&#8217;re close to settling a decades-long negotiation among the Navajo Nation, federal government and the State of Utah over water rights and infrastructure for Utah Navajos.      Like many of you, I have been alarmed by the increase in vaping related lung illnesses - including 125 cases in Utah - and statistics indicating that five million kids are now vaping regularly - putting them at risk of serious health problems and a lifetime of addiction. As a member of the Senate committee that deals with health matters, I am pushing the Administration and Congress to act without any further delay to reverse this deadly trend. This fall, I introduced the Ending New Nicotine Dependencies (ENND) Act, which bans flavors, ensures that vaping cartridges are tamper-proof, and bans e-cigarettes from our schools. As part of the recent government funding bill, the President signed into law the Tobacco 21 Act, which I helped introduce, to raise the federal minimum age for purchasing tobacco products to 21. The bill also includes a requirement for HHS to take steps toward ensuring vape cartridges are tamper-proof.   Levied on everything from pacemakers to defibrillators and surgical tools, the Medical Device Tax hurts patients and stifles medical innovation. Utah&#8217;s medical device companies, which employ thousands of workers, are also negatively impacted. Luckily, this harmful tax was permanently repealed last week. Bringing more transparency to drug pricing and reducing out-of-pocket costs for consumers remains a top priority of mine. I&#8217;ve been working with my colleagues on the Health committee to advance legislation that achieves these goals.     With ever-increasing challenges to our national security and interests, it is imperative that the United States promote peace through strength as the leader of the free world. Addressing the threat that China poses to our fundamental values of freedom, human rights, and free enterprise will continue to be the principal challenge facing our nation in the 21st century. I&#8217;ve worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work on a holistic strategy to combat this threat. The annual defense bill, recently signed into law, includes my provision to ensure Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is not removed from the Commerce Department&#8217;s Entity List of sanctioned companies until it no longer poses a national security threat. Another provision I authored requires the U.S. to partner with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, Europe, and beyond, to develop a unified approach to address the rise of China. This legislation is awaiting full consideration in the Senate.  As the Chairman of the Subcommittee dealing with the Middle East, I traveled with Ranking Member Senator Murphy (D-CT) to Israel, Ramallah, Jordan, and Iraq to discuss with government and civilian leaders how the United States can support a more secure and prosperous future in the region. We&#8217;ve also held hearings aimed at strengthening U.S. Middle East policy.     Strengthening ourselves abroad also means strengthening ourselves here at home. Our nation&#8217;s debt is nearly $23 trillion - we&#8217;re spending nearly one trillion more dollars per year than we&#8217;re taking in. Last year alone, we spent almost $300 billion on interest and increasingly, the burden of these interest payments will fall on the American taxpayer. Most of our federal spending - two-thirds - is automatic. Namely, our entitlement programs and trust funds: Social Security, Medicare, our Highway Trust Fund, and the like.   Without action, these trust funds will be facing insolvency within 13 years - forcing either steep benefit cuts or drastic tax hikes. I&#8217;ve teamed up with Senator Manchin (D-WV) and a group of seven bipartisan Senate colleagues to introduce the TRUST Act, which would create congressional committees specifically tasked to develop legislation to restore and strengthen endangered federal trust funds.     Utah is one of the only states in the nation where births are outpacing the mortality rate. Growing families are a blessing - but they are also expensive. The majority of working parents do not get paid when they take time off from work after the birth or adoption of a child, which can mean depleted savings, credit card debt, or student loan defaults. As debate continues over the best paid family leave solution, I joined Senator Rubio (R-FL) on a proposal, the New Parents Act, to allow new parents to use a portion of their Social Security for paid parental leave. It wouldn&#8217;t add to the national debt, impose new taxes, or create a new entitlement program - but it does give families flexibility on how to use their own benefits to best suit their needs. During recent negotiations over tax legislation, Senator Bennet (D-CO) and I saw an opportunity to partner on a pro-family, pro-child policy that would benefit millions of Americans. We offered a compromise plan that would have extended and reformed the Child Tax Credit, provided technical fixes to the 2017 Tax Law supported by the business community, and permanently repealed the Medical Device Tax. By making the child tax credit fully refundable, the proposal would especially help parents handle the costs of raising children, while still encouraging work as the benefit phases higher alongside income. While this plan was ultimately not adopted, it could serve as a path forward for future conservative pro-family, pro-child tax policy.        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Unsubscribe         ","title":"Senator, 1st Class","gender":"M","state":"UT","party":"Republican","score":2.576326},{"name":"Congressman Buddy Carter","address":"GA01Newsletter@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-12-29","subject":"ICYMI: Unlike Pelosi, House Republicans have a bipartisan cure for\r\n prescription drug costs","body":"ICYMI: UNLIKE PELOSI, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE A BIPARTISAN CURE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS In case you missed it, I recently wrote an article with fellow members of the Doctors Caucus about our bipartisan plan to lower prescription drug costs for patients. Click here to read more in the Washington Examiner. Unlike Pelosi, House Republicans have a bipartisan cure for prescription drug costs As physicians and healthcare providers, and now policymakers, we believe that innovation will drive the cost of healthcare down more than any new law or policy. Whether here in Congress or in our office as a physician, we strive to keep patients out of the hospital and at home and healthy with their loved ones. Having the best tools and medicine in our toolkit helps us achieve that mission. Patients deserve access to cutting-edge medicine that is going to treat, and maybe even cure, Alzheimers or diabetes. We need to make sure the next miracle drug sitting in the approval pipeline that could cure childhood cancers, as well as metastatic breast, lung, skin, prostate, or pancreatic cancers, are more quickly available for your loved ones. Lives literally depend on it. While we were in medical, pharmacy and dental school, there were simply no cures or good treatment options for most cancers, leukemia, hepatitis, depression, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Within the last decade, weve seen groundbreaking medical miracles. One notable example is former President Jimmy Carter, who had widespread metastatic melanoma and was treated by a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Thanks to American research and ingenuity, we have medicine unlike the world has ever seen, such as CAR T-cell therapy. Two therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration within the last two years to defeat lymphoma and acute pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia. More recently, the FDA approved a miracle drug for cystic fibrosis, which affects 30,000 Americans. And, finally, its worth mentioning that just six years ago, Hepatitis C was a death sentence. Thanks to investments in innovation, 3.5 million people with Hepatitis C can now take a pill once a week for 12 weeks and be completely cured. None of these treatments would have been made available if it werent for the United States protecting innovation and encouraging innovators to be pioneers. Last year, national healthcare spending reached $3.6 trillion. About one-third of all healthcare spending is tied to hospital care, while prescription drugs make up 9%. About 28% of the federal budget is now being spent directly on healthcare. If we are ever going to balance the federal budget, we must get the cost of healthcare under control. Protecting and streamlining the next miracle drugs is an obvious way to help do that. We cannot even begin to guess what the savings to Medicare costs would be if we had the cure for Alzheimers and dementia and other illnesses where Medicare is the single largest payer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently introduced, and the House passed, H.R. 3, a government price-fixing bill that would absolutely decimate private research and development for potential future miracle drugs to come to market. As with any other industry, the federal government takeover of medicine will halt innovation and lower quality. While it may seem popular today to demonize Western medicine, America is still the gold standard and global leader in cutting-edge medicine. Of note, of the 270 drugs that have come to the world market since 2011, 100% are available to patients in America, compared to 8% in China, 41% in Australia, 52% in Canada, and 67% in Germany. With that said, as policymakers, we recognize the need to balance innovation while appropriately addressing shortcomings in our system. Were addressing these failures head-on. Our solution is H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. The provisions in this legislation are bipartisan and will lower out-of-pocket patient spending, protect access to new medicines and cures, strengthen transparency, and champion competition. We want to promote innovation, which requires government getting out of the way  not more government red tape. H.R. 19 will make the process for FDA drug approval far more streamlined and, among other things, promote generic competition. Finally, for the first time ever, this bill provides seniors and Medicare recipients a cap on out-of-pocket drug spending, which allows them to budget their out-of-pocket expenses annually. We want to reiterate that every single provision in this legislative alternative is bipartisan. H.R. 19 could actually become law. We truly can lower drug costs for consumers without destroying innovation, unlike with H.R. 3. Thanks to the Trump administrations leadership, people now have twice the number of generic drugs approved per year in comparison to the previous administration, and the actual costs of prescriptions have gone down slightly for the first time in modern medical history. This is just the beginning. Republicans are ready to do more to work together with Democrats to lower prescription drug prices without killing ingenuity with government control. As physicians and healthcare providers, we will continue to advocate for incentivizing good health and prevention. Lets get to work and deliver meaningful solutions to all. By GOP Reps.

And to my Jewish constituents, Happy Hanukkah and may the Festival of Lights bring blessings upon you and your families. For those of you traveling this holiday season, please stay safe and enjoy this special time with friends and family. &nbsp; Last week wrapped up a busy stretch in Washington as Congress prepared to break for the holidays. After months of time wasted on partisan political theater, House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump. The only bipartisan aspect of the entire impeachment process was the votes in opposition, as several Democrats voted with my Republican colleagues and me against impeaching the President.  Unfortunately, it was only a matter of minutes before the double-talk began. In yet another shameful display of what the American people absolutely despise about Washington, after representing to the American people that it was an urgent matter of national security to impeach the President, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are now delaying sending the articles to the Senate while they attempt to rig another unfair process.  The House also considered and passed two separate packages to keep the government funded. The first package contained four appropriations bills: Defense, Homeland Security, Financial Services-General Government, and Commerce-Justice-Science. The second package contained eight appropriations bills: Agriculture-FDA, Labor-HHS-Education, Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, State-Foreign Operations, Transportation-HUD, Military Construction-VA, and Legislative Branch.  While much more needs to be done to restrain spending and address our debt, there are a few provisions from these packages I am pleased to highlight. In the first package, we not only provided funding for the border wall, we were successful in removing geographic restrictions on its construction. We provided our brave men and women in uniform with a much deserved 3.1% pay raise while continuing to prioritize rebuilding our military after years of neglect by the Obama Administration. And we shut down attempts by the Democrats to weaken pro-life protections. &nbsp; The House also passed the Conference Report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20 NDAA), which sets policy for the Department of Defense, authorizes funding for its programs, strengthens our national security and supports our men and women in uniform. Of particular note was the inclusion of one of President Trump&#8217;s chief priorities, the creation of the Space Force, which will be the sixth branch of the military.&nbsp; Lastly, the House passed President Trump&#8217;s United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is a massive win for American workers and our economy. Continue reading for more information on the USMCA and impeachment sham.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   United States Mexico Canada Agreement Passes the House Last week, the House passed the USMCA which is a major win for our economy. America&#8217;s workers, farmers, and manufacturers will be buoyed by this agreement as it will add 176,000 new American jobs and bring in over $68 billion in new economic activity.  This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation. By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Impeachment Sham Despite any evidence of a crime committed by the President, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have rushed this partisan impeachment sham in an attempt to overturn the 2016 election.&nbsp;By operating in secret, disregarding facts and evidence, and instructing witnesses not to answer Republican questions, this absurd abuse of power by Democrats has failed to reveal an impeachable offense and certainly has come nowhere close to the threshold necessary for impeachment. Speaker Pelosi directly contradicted her previous statements that impeachment must have bipartisan support and the only bipartisan votes taken were the votes against impeachment.

The Senate Passes Numerous Colorado Priorities in Year-End Spending Bills Last week the President signed into law numerous priorities I&#8217;ve championed for the state of Colorado this year as part of the year-end spending package. It included my efforts to repeal the costly Health Insurance Tax, which will lower health care costs for Colorado families by hundreds of dollars a year, provided vital resources for our military service members, and the package will help future generations enjoy Colorado&#8217;s public lands by increasing funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This spending package will also have a direct impact on Colorado communities by fully funding critical services for counties with large amounts of federal land and supporting innovative energy research projects in Colorado.  The 9-8-8 Suicide Hotline Takes Two Giant Steps Forward   &nbsp;  My push to establish 9-8-8 as the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline recently took two critical steps forward. The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed my bill and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 5-0 to move forward on establishing the three-digit suicide hotline. These are important steps in our efforts to establish 9-8-8 as the national suicide prevention hotline and make sure that every American has access to mental health support with a number that&#8217;s easy to remember in a time of crisis. Mental health groups and veterans support organizations cheered both landmark actions to create the three-digit suicide hotline &#150; see what they&#8217;re saying here.  Defense Bill Supporting Colorado Service Members is Signed Into Law   Click here or the picture above to view remarks from Senator Gardner.  The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is now law, which is great news for Colorado service members and their families. This means troops will receive the largest pay raise in a decade and our military base communities will receive new funding for roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects. The NDAA authorizes $322 million in military construction projects in Colorado and officially establishes U.S. Space Force as a military service branch, which will ensure Colorado&#8217;s service members can continue to support our military space operations. Learn more about how the National Defense Authorization Act will benefit Colorado&#8217;s service members and their families here.  Bringing Accountability to the VA The Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation I introduced to bring much-needed accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA Provider Accountability Act would require the VA to inform the National Practitioner Data Bank and state licensing boards of major adverse actions committed by medical providers at the VA. Additionally, it would prevent the VA from signing settlements with fired employees to hide major medical mistakes in their personnel files. The vast majority of VA employees and medical providers provide exceptional care to our veterans and we are grateful for their service. However, there is no excuse for allowing certain medical providers with a history of committing major medical errors to continue putting other patients at risk. We owe every single veteran the best possible care, and we can only provide that care with increased accountability. Senate passage of this bipartisan bill means we are one step closer towards protecting veterans and potential patients outside the VA system from mistakes made by medical providers who have proven themselves to be dangerous. Cracking Down on Illegal Robocalls Coloradans are bombarded with 2.5 million robocalls every day, and El Paso County has the highest rate of robocall complaints in the country. Robocalls are not only a nuisance, but they also pose significant harm to consumers, oftentimes with the intent to defraud or steal personal information. This week Congress sent legislation I&#8217;m backing, the bipartisan TRACED Act, to the president&#8217;s desk to crack down on these illegal calls. The TRACED Act requires phone companies to implement a system that would authenticate and verify phone calls to ensure that they are legitimate. It increases fines on individuals who attempted or succeeded using spoofing phone calls, which is a tactic that fraudulent callers utilize to show a different telephone number and disguise their identity. The TRACED Act will help stop these illegal calls and protect hardworking Coloradans from being harassed by illegal robocalls and scams.  Celebrating 100 Years of the Colorado Farm Bureau   &nbsp;  Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner&#8217;s remarks.  &nbsp; I spoke on the floor of the United States Senate to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Colorado Farm Bureau Federation and celebrate the long history of the Farm Bureau representing the farmers and ranchers of Colorado. Agriculture is personal to me &#150; I grew up in Yuma on Colorado&#8217;s Eastern Plains, a town whose heart lies in agriculture. Our livelihoods and our neighbors&#8217; livelihoods depend on a strong agriculture industry. Congratulations to the Colorado Farm Bureau for 100 years of being a strong voice for farmers, ranchers, and our rural communities in the Centennial State, and for all their work to protect the Colorado Way of Life. I look forward to continuing our work together with the Farm Bureau and seeing what we can accomplish for the next 100 years of agriculture in Colorado.  Senate Committee Approves My Efforts to Improve PILT, Extend Secure Rural Schools Program, and Expand Yucca House National Monument. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources approved three bills I&#8217;m advancing in the Senate to provide funding for critical services in counties with large amounts of federal land and protect Ancestral Pueblo cultural sites near the Yucca House National Monument. S. 2108 would provide greater parity for small counties that receive Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) funding from the federal government, and S. 430 would extend the Secure Rural School (SRS) program, which provides funding for critical services in counties with large amounts of tax-exempt forestlands. These bills will make sure critical services like search and rescue, emergency medical services, law enforcement, schools, and maintenance of roads can continue. The committee also advanced my legislation to expand the Yucca House National Monument in southwest Colorado. A private landowner is seeking to donate 160 acres of land next to the monument, but a donation must be facilitated through an Act of Congress. The Yucca House National Monument is one of the most well-preserved ancient dwellings in the country, and my bill will help preserve these Ancestral Pueblo sites and protect a piece of our state&#8217;s great history.  Responding to North Korea&#8217;s Statement That It Will Not Denuclearize North Korea&#8217;s ambassador to the United Nations&nbsp;recently stated that North Korea has no intentions to denuclearize, as an end-of-the-year deadline set by dictator Kim Jong Un approaches to see progress in negotiations with the United States. This announcement confirms North Korea never had any intention of ending their nuclear ambitions and shows why the U.S. should return to maximum pressure on the Kim regime. I&#8217;m calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan&nbsp;LEED Act, which Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and I introduced to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea. North Korea will remain a global outcast until it reverses course from a long history of human rights abuses, aggression, and defying international law.&nbsp;I also led a letter to U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft,&nbsp;urging she make clear that the administration intends to fully implement the &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; policy&nbsp;on North Korea and impose sanctions as required by law.&nbsp;I will continue to work with my colleagues and the administration toward peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula that is complete, verifiable, and irreversible.  Holding Russia Accountable for Its Actions My legislation directing the Department of State to determine whether Russia is a State Sponsor of Terrorism was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Stopping Malign Activities from Russian Terrorism (SMART) Act requires the State Department to determine within 90 days and report to Congress whether the Russian Federation meets the criteria under U.S. law to be designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The Foreign Relations Committee also passed my hard-hitting Russia sanctions package&nbsp;to increase economic, political, and diplomatic pressure on the Kremlin to deter Russia&#8217;s malign actions around the world.  Introducing A New Effort to Help Prevent Suicides As part of my ongoing initiative to address rising suicide rates in Colorado, I introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act. More than 50,000 visits to Colorado emergency rooms in the last three years were due to a mental health crisis. Data shows that around 40 percent of people who die by suicide visited an emergency department in the year leading up to their death. This bipartisan legislation will help emergency department professionals identify and treat patients with a high risk of suicide, improving prevention. It will also help recruit behavioral health professionals and develop innovative solutions for suicide prevention through tools like telehealth, which will help provide critical mental health support for rural and underserved areas.  Building Out Rural Broadband in Colorado The Senate Commerce Committee passed my measure to provide potentially billions of dollars to expand access to broadband in rural areas. My proposal would ensure that at least 10 percent of the proceeds from a sale of C-band spectrum would be allocated for rural buildout in unserved and underserved areas throughout Colorado and the country. By approving this legislation, the Senate Commerce Committee took a great step toward bridging the divide between urban and rural Colorado.

LEGISLATION 47TH DISTRICT ABOUT ALAN CONTACT ALAN &nbsp;                In This Edition  This week, I joined with my House colleagues in passing two articles of impeachment against President Trump.  I also voted this week to approve government funding for fiscal year 2020. While the House this week passed a bill to implement the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade bill, I could not support it due to the agreement's failure to address climate change. I voted this week to restore the full deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). A reminder that applications for those who wish to participate in the Congressional Foster Shadow Day 2020 are due no later than December 31. In the Inbox this week, I share a letter I sent to constituents who wrote in asking me to support the College Affordability Act. Congress U this week looks at the history of the Congressional Christmas Tree.  Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to look at last week&#8217;s poll results, and make sure you take this week&#8217;s poll in the right-hand column.            CONNECT WITH ME              &nbsp;     Will you be travelling for the holidays this year?  Yes   No   Maybe   Don't know/Unsure      &nbsp;If you have a problem, click here to open survey in a new window        &nbsp;  &nbsp;       Passing Articles Of Impeachment  As a Member of Congress, I have taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution.  I believe that I, along with my colleagues in the House, upheld our oaths in voting to impeach President Donald Trump.  The facts in this case are as simple as they are tragic.  Witness after witness&#8212;non-partisan government employees, respected military member, even the president&#8217;s handpicked ambassador&#8212;attested to these facts.  No one has credibly refuted them.  The facts are that President Trump in his call to Ukraine President Zelensky tried to coerce Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. President Trump&#8212;in direct violation of the law and his own oath of office&#8212;used the power of the presidency for his own personal political gain.  What was the bribe he attempted to use to get cooperation from President Zelensky? It was nearly $400 million in military aid already approved by Congress and signed off on by the Pentagon and State Department. By withholding this desperately needed aid, the president undermined our ally Ukraine in the midst of their ongoing struggle with Russia. In aiding Russia and weakening Ukraine, the president also undermined our own national security.  And when President Trump got caught, the president attempted to cover up the crime and shut down any investigation by obstructing Congress, a coequal branch of government. He directly ordered White House and federal agency officers to ignore lawful subpoenas from Congress. He refused&#8212;and ordered others to refuse&#8212;to turn over documents legally requested by Congress. At every turn, the president&#8217;s response to the House&#8217;s use of its Constitutional powers of oversight was to obstruct.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The most concerning thing is that the president, despite being caught, despite being shown to violate the law, despite being impeached, continues with the scheme of convincing Ukrainian officials to smear the president&#8217;s political opponents. The crime continues.  There is overwhelming evidence that this president poses an urgent and ongoing threat to our elections, national security, and the rule of law.  In order for House Members to uphold their oaths to the Constitution, we had no alternative but to impeach the president. Our constitutional republic and democratic form of government are at stake. You can see my floor speech during House debate on articles of impeachment . Also, click here to   Funding The Government  I was glad to see the House pass robust (and bipartisan) appropriations measures this week to fund the government, and to support key progressive priorities. On healthcare alone, we&#8217;re repealing the so-called &#8220;Cadillac healthcare tax,&#8221; blocking White House sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, continuing funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and investing record amounts into medical research. We&#8217;re also raising the tobacco age to 21 and ensuring strong support for initiatives to lower the price of prescription drugs by increasing competition for generics. Budget appropriations this year also provided more than $61 billion for infrastructure investments through dedicated trust funds, $9 billion for environmental protection, and $640 million to strengthen rural broadband. We are also providing $80 billion for VA medical care, including funding to provide homelessness assistance, suicide prevention and outreach, and gender-specific care. Here at home, I was proud to help secure a record $35 million dollars for the STARBASE program, a nationwide program which supports STEM education for thousands of elementary school children each year right here in Los Alamitos at the Joint Forces Training Base. House Votes To Implement The USMCA Trade Deal  This week, I voted against , the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, which would implement the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).  I believe the bill was not ready to be voted on by the U.S. Congress. However, my Democratic colleagues and Speaker Pelosi deserve credit for their relentless focus on key priorities for American workers and consumers. Because of their efforts, the USMCA is undoubtedly stronger than the agreement President Trump put forward last year. They eliminated the agreement&#8217;s giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry and won important provisions to protect labor and environmental standards in Mexico. These include tough new enforcement mechanisms to make certain that the promises of USMCA to raise wages and improve working conditions in Mexico are realized.  It is critical to note that the agreement lacks binding, enforceable commitments to curb harmful carbon emissions. Our continent must grapple with the global climate crisis and enact bold solutions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. That is why I voted against H.R. 5430. It is vital that future trade agreements include these provisions, and I intend to push the next president to add the Paris Agreement commitments to the USMCA during their first 100 days. H.R.5430 passed the House by a vote of 385-41 and now heads to the Senate for consideration. President Trump has announced he intends to sign the bill into law if it passes the Senate. Eliminating Caps On SALT Deductions  This week, I voted to pass , the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act of 2019, which passed the House in a 218-206 vote. The bill restores the full deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) that was capped at $10,000 by the 2017 Republican Tax Law. It also enhanced above-the-line deductions for teachers and first responders to offset the out-of-pocket expenses these hardworking government employees incur to serve our communities. The Republican tax plan put a callous target on communities like ours&#8212;states and cities that have stepped into the void left by the federal government and funded essential community services like transportation, schools, and first responders. I was proud to vote to restore the SALT deduction for 2020 and 2021 to reverse the harmful tax increase the Trump Tax Law exacted from my hardworking middle-class constituents. The legislation is revenue-neutral and pays for the deduction by restoring the previous tax rate for the highest income Americans.       Congressional Foster Shadow Day 2020  Just a reminder that applications to be selected as a Foster Youth Shadow Day Delegate for the 2020 Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day Program in Washington, D.C. are due no later than December 31.  The Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Program is an opportunity for young people with personal experience in the foster care system to spend time with a Congressional representative in Washington, D.C.  I&#8217;ve been proud to participate in the program for many years, and I always look forward to meeting the delegate for the 47th District and giving them a view of what I do and how Congress works.   Those selected to participate will be representing thousands of current foster youth and alumni of foster care across the nation. Participating in the program allows current foster youth or alumni of foster care and policymakers to meet and learn from one another. Before Shadow Day, all participants will attend online trainings to prepare for their meetings with policymakers. The trainings will include an overview of federal foster care policy, community organizing and guidance on how to speak to and learn from Members of Congress about Congress while gaining &#8220;hands-on&#8221; understanding about how the U.S. government operates.  Members of Congress like me who participate in the program have the opportunity to hear and learn from the perspectives of individuals who have lived experience in the foster care system to help them as they pursue policies that impact all foster youth. Shadow Day will be in early June, 2020.       Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents asking me to support the . Below is my response to those messages: &#8220;You will be glad to know that I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. Like you, I am deeply committed to ensuring quality education is made available for all Americans.&nbsp; As a former college professor for nearly 30 years and a past chair of the California Senate Education Committee, I know firsthand how valuable education is to the long-term success of our nation.&nbsp; High-quality education is a fundamental right that should be guaranteed to all.&nbsp; The Higher Education Act has not been reauthorized in over a decade, and I am proud to support this comprehensive bill to reauthorize our federal higher education programs. The CAA would lower the cost of college, improve the quality of higher education, and expand opportunity for students for all backgrounds.&nbsp; This bill would increase investment in public colleges and universities while holding institutions and predatory, for-profit colleges accountable; increase the value of Pell Grants; and expand dual enrollment access to high school students.&nbsp; The CAA also provides relief to those seeking or currently holding student loans and makes repayment plans easier to understand.&nbsp; Lastly, the CAA also increases opportunities for low-income students and students of color by increasing funding for Minority Serving Institutions like CSU-Long Beach.  During my time in office, I have worked to support access to higher education and address student loan debt.&nbsp; I have cosponsored legislation like the Student Loan Refinancing Act, which would allow people with federal student loans to refinance at lower interest rates.  As your Representative, I will continue to work to give all our people access to education that gives students the tools and knowledge they need to succeed.&#8221;  If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.  You can find out how to contact me on my website by        The People's Tree  Each year since 1923, a large evergreen tree has been placed on The Ellipse near the White House in Washington, D.C. to serve as the National Christmas Tree.  Congress has its own version of the National Christmas Tree called the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. Also known as \"The People&#8217;s Tree,\" the Capitol Christmas Tree is placed each year on the West Front Lawn of the U.S. Capitol in celebration of the holiday season. The tradition began in 1964 when Speaker of the U.S. House, John W. McCormack (D-MA), placed a live Christmas tree on the Capitol lawn. This first Capitol Christmas Tree was a live tree that was redecorated each of the subsequent three years as the Capitol Christmas Tree before succumbing to wind and root damage after the 1967 holiday season. White pines from Maryland served as the Capitol Christmas Tree for the following two years, before the Capitol Architect decided in 1970 to obtain all future Capitol trees from various National Forests via the U.S. Forest Service.  The Capitol tree is lit in a ceremony normally presided over by the sitting Speaker of the House.  From 1990 to 2004, the tree was officially renamed the Capitol Holiday Tree, before reverting back to the original name of Capitol Christmas Tree for the 2005 season. The name has remained unchanged since 2005.  Since 1964, California National Forests have provided the Capitol Christmas Tree on four occasions--in 1986, 1993, 1995, and most recently in 2011.

Bad actors can trick vulnerable folks into revealing personal information that could lead to stolen data or drained bank accounts. These violations of privacy have got to stop, which is why I'm taking steps to crack down on robocalls and protect consumers with my TRACED Act. The Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act is a bipartisan bill that cracks down on robocalls by requiring phone companies to make it easier to block unwanted calls and ensures robocall violations are prosecuted. Even in a gridlocked Washington, there's one thing everyone can agree on: robocalls have got to stop. This week, my colleagues in the Senate showed they can still work together by overwhelmingly passing the TRACED Act, and getting it one step closer to the finish line. Now, all we need is the Presidents signature to make this bill law and start hanging up on robocalls for good.

This will be my last E-Newsletter of the year because the House has adjourned for the remainder of the year. I&#8217;ve also included accomplishments in 2019. Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week    Voted YES on two Articles of Impeachment  On Wednesday, the House passed two Articles of Impeachment&nbsp;against the President. The first Article accuses the President of abusing his power by withholding congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into his political rival. In doing so, the President undermined our national security and the integrity of our elections to support his own political interests. The second Article accuses the President of unprecedented obstruction of Congress by defying subpoenas and directing agencies not to cooperate with the investigation.  As I cast my vote for the Articles, I was guided by my oath of office to &#8220;support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&#8221; The Constitution is the soul of our nation, and by defending it, we are saying we will not be soulless. To review a timeline of the impeachment inquiry and related documents, visit my website.&nbsp;  Voted YES on the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act    The 2017 Republican Tax Bill took a sledgehammer to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction by limiting it to $10,000 annually for both individuals and married couples beginning in tax year 2018. Prior to this harmful cap, 194,160 of my constituents claimed an average SALT deduction of $63,083 in 2017. More than half of all taxpayers in our District claimed this credit, and half of these taxpayers earned between $75,000 and $100,000 annually.  I&#8217;ve consistently stated that capping the SALT deduction represents an assault on the middle class which is why I cosponsored and voted for the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act to eliminate the marriage penalty this year and the SALT deduction cap altogether in 2020 and 2021. The measure passed the House by a vote of 218 to 206.  Voted YES on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act  The House passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act after months of tough negotiating. Democrats secured critical changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for American workers, delivering an agreement that is stronger than the first draft of USMCA that the Trump Administration put forward.&nbsp; The USMCA now has the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any U.S. trade agreement, as well as critical victories for workers, lower prescription drug costs, and environmental protections.  Voted on Spending Bills  This week the House considered two spending bills to provide funding for the federal government for 2020. I voted &#8216;Yes&#8217; on the first spending bill, which increases funding for important investments in public health, housing, education, child care, clean energy, infrastructure, and foreign aid. Importantly, the legislation includes $25 million split between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to study the public health impacts of gun violence, the first time such funding has been provided in more than 20 years!  I voted &#8216;No&#8217; on the second spending bill because it failed to significantly reduce funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and hold them accountable for their inhumane treatment of migrants at the border. The legislation also fails to limit the Trump Administration&#8217;s ability to transfer funding from other accounts to pay for his misguided wall on the southern border. While there were other good provisions in this bill, I could not in good conscience vote for legislation that does not hold the Trump Administration accountable for cruel immigration policies.  Legislative Accomplishments of 2019  The first year of the new Democratic Majority has been highly productive. The House passed over 450 bills, with 330 of them being bipartisan. We tackled the important issues to strengthen health care, implement background checks for firearms, protect our environment, and secure election security and voter rights. Below are some highlights of the 452 bills I sponsored and cosponsored this year. Passage of 31 Bipartisan Bills by the Health Subcommittee which I Chair    On January 15, 2019, the Democratic Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee elected me as the first woman ever to serve as Chair of the Health Subcommittee. In my first year as Chairwoman, my Subcommittee passed 31 bills to:   Lower drug prices&nbsp; Strengthen the ACA Fund critical public health programs and workforce training programs End surprise billing Address the maternal health crisis End the youth e-cigarette epidemic&nbsp;  Each of the 31 bills passed by my Subcommittee received bipartisan support, either through bipartisan cosponsors or bipartisan votes in the Committee or in the full House.  My subcommittee also held 19 hearings this year, including hearings to address the broken pharmaceutical supply chain&nbsp;and examine gun violence as a public health issue.  To review a full list of the hearings and legislation we passed, click here.  Passage of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act  The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3, the&nbsp;Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;to address the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. For the first time in the history of Medicare, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be able to directly negotiate the price of the most expensive drugs in the country, including insulin. The lower prices will not only apply to Medicare beneficiaries, they will apply to everyone who has private insurance. Manufacturers will no longer be allowed to hike prices faster than the rate of inflation, and very importantly, it caps the out-of-pocket costs of seniors for their prescription drugs at $2,000 annually. Among several significant policies, the&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act:   Lowers drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for all Americans&nbsp;by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug companies. The lower prices and cost-sharing will apply to Medicare and ALL private insurance plans.   Stops drug price hikes&nbsp;by requiring manufacturers who raise the price of any drug that is covered by Medicare (including generics) above the rate of inflation to lower the price or pay the entire price above inflation back to the government.   Limits out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs&nbsp;for Medicare beneficiaries. For the first time in the history of the Medicare Part D program every senior will have their out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000. Today, some seniors pay up to $5,100 in out-of-pocket costs and some pay more.   Increases NIH funding&nbsp;to research and develop new cures. It provides $2.895 billion for the FDA to ensure the safety of our drugs; invests in our community health centers; and directs $10 billion to address the opioid crisis.   Adds vision, hearing, and dental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as colonoscopies and lymphedema treatment.  Passage of a Resolution to Recognize the Armenian Genocide   After fighting for 27 years to end the official U.S. silence regarding the first genocide of the 20th century, I led the effort to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide, and the House passed a resolution to do so on a bipartisan vote. Between 1915 and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians, and hundreds of thousands of Assyrians, Greeks, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. There is a historic parallel today as Turkey is once again engaging in ethnic cleansing, this time against the Kurds in Syria. The resolution we passed not only honors and commemorates my Armenian and Assyrian ancestors and all those who perished in the first genocide of the 20th century, but it also serves as a timely reminder that we must remain vigilant to prevent similar atrocities today. 100+ years of official U.S. silence ended on October 29th with a bipartisan vote of 405 to 11. The Senate passed the Resolution last week on December 12th. The U.S. has now joined the 49 U.S. states and over 2 dozen countries, including 14 NATO allies, that have passed Armenian Genocide resolutions.  Introduction of the Online Privacy Act, the Strongest Privacy Bill in Congress  Every American is vulnerable to privacy violations with few tools to defend themselves. Too often, our private information online is stolen, abused, used for profit, or grossly mishandled. In November, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA-19) joined me to introduce the&nbsp;Online Privacy Act. Our legislation secures individuals&#8217; privacy, encourages innovation, and restores trust in technology companies. It protects our privacy by:   Creating User Rights &#8211;&nbsp;The bill grants every American the right to access, correct, or delete their data. It also creates new rights, like the right to impermanence, which lets users decide how long companies can keep their data.   Placing Clear Obligations on Companies&nbsp;&#8211; The bill minimizes the amount of data companies collect, process, disclose, and maintain, and bars companies from using data in discriminatory ways. Additionally, companies must receive consent from users in plain, simple language.   Establishing a Digital Privacy Agency (DPA)&nbsp;&#8211; The bill establishes an independent agency led by a Director that&#8217;s appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. The DPA will enforce privacy protections and investigate abuses.   Strengthening Enforcement&nbsp;&#8211; The bill empowers state attorneys general to enforce violations of the bill and allows individuals to appoint nonprofits to represent them in private class action lawsuits.  Our bill received strong endorsements from public interest organizations, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) ranked our bill the strongest of nine privacy bills in Congress.  Passage of the Presidential Tax Transparency Act as a part of H.R. 1, the For the People Act  The House passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act, to restore trust in our government. The legislation addresses corruption, strengthens our democracy, and returns power to the people of our country. I&#8217;m proud to have one of my bills included in H.R. 1 that requires sitting presidents, vice presidents, and major party nominees for both offices to disclose their 10 most recent federal income tax returns to the public. Presidents and presidential candidates should be required by law to inform the American people of their finances so we can determine who will best make decisions in the interest of our country.  Passage of the TRACED Act to End the Scourge of Robocalls  Americans received an unfathomable 48 billion robocalls last year and a near-record 5.5 billion calls in October of this year, but relief is on the way! The House and Senate passed the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act. The bill will bring much needed relief to all of us who are subjected to abusive robocall practices. This legislation requires that phone carriers implement call authentication technology and offer call blocking services to consumers at no additional charge. Importantly, it requires the FCC to enact safeguards so companies cannot abuse robocall exemptions, and ensures the FCC has the authority and the tools to take strong, quick action when it tracks down robocallers. The bill awaits the President&#8217;s signature. Three of My Health Bills Passed the House, Two of Them Were Signed into Law  Pandemic and All-Hazards Advancing Innovation Act  My bipartisan Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA) was signed into law to strengthen and improve U.S. national preparedness and response for public health emergencies, including infectious diseases such as Ebola and measles, natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, and manmade disasters. The legislation provides essential funding to bolster our defenses against bioterrorism and public health emergencies.  ACE Kids Act  My bipartisan legislation with Reps. Castor, Bilirakis, and Herrera Beutler, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (ACE Kids Act), was signed into law to improve how care is delivered to America&#8217;s children with complex medical conditions on Medicaid. The legislation allows states to opt into a new Medicaid program which will provide complete wrap-around healthcare services for the nation&#8217;s sickest children. The ACE Kids Act aims to better coordinate this care while reducing overall Medicaid spending by creating a Medicaid care coordination program. This legislation is based on existing programs that save money by decreasing hospital visits and improving care. Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital was a sterling partner in this effort.  Purple Book Continuity Act  The House unanimously passed my bipartisan Purple Book Continuity Act to make drugs more affordable by bringing transparency to the current patent system. The legislation implements transparency reforms to the Purple Book, a document created by the Food and Drug Administration, which manufacturers use when considering where to invest their research and development dollars. Under my legislation, the Purple Book will be updated more routinely and be made available easily online, informing manufacturers of brand-name biological drug patents that are expiring. This will encourage manufacturers to develop alternatives to high cost drugs, adding pricing pressure to the drug market and saving patients money.  Passage of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act  The House passed my bipartisan legislation that increases efficiency of federal data centers. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act directs the Executive branch to harness information and communications technologies to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use within the federal government.  As the nation&#8217;s largest energy user, landowner, and employer, the federal government should lead by example to improve the energy efficiency of its technology equipment and data centers. This legislation will reduce the federal government&#8217;s energy use, save taxpayer dollars, and set the standard for the private sector. This legislation is still awaiting a vote in the Senate and I look forward to them taking this up in 2020.  Passage of Key Provisions of the TRUE Fees Act  Cable companies pocket an estimated $28 billion a year from the American people by advertising one price to customers and then tacking on confusing charges and hidden fees to their bills. Congress passed key provisions from my TRUE Fees Act which requires cable and satellite TV providers to disclose an &#8216;all-in&#8217; price to consumers, including fees and taxes, before consumers sign up for a service; requires that consumers receive a formal notice of fees and &#8216;all-in&#8217; prices within 24 hours of signing up for a service; and grants consumers 24 hours to cancel after receiving formal notice of fees, without penalty.  Passage of the Save the Internet Act  The House passed the&nbsp;Save the Internet Act&nbsp;to restore bipartisan net neutrality protections for consumers and small businesses. The legislation reverses the Trump Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s (FCC) wrong-headed repeal of critical net neutrality protections in late 2017.&nbsp; Since the FCC&#8217;s decision to end net neutrality, control of the Internet has been taken from the American people and handed over to Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, empowering them to generate new profits by restricting access.  The&nbsp;Save the Internet Act&nbsp;is a simple, but powerful three-page bill that wrests control from ISPs and restores the internet as an open platform for content, speech, and information. The Internet is one of the greatest communication networks in human history and an American invention. It&#8217;s our responsibility to protect it as a force to drive innovation, expand our economy, and promote free speech in our democracy. Watch my floor speech on the&nbsp;Save the Internet Act&nbsp;here.  Constituent Outreach  Town Hall Meetings  I held 15 Telephone Town Hall Meetings and six in-person Town Hall Meetings throughout our District to give constituents the opportunity to ask me questions and voice their concerns. Thousands of constituents participated in to our Tele-Town Hall Meetings and our in-person Town Hall Meetings. With each Town Hall Meeting, I'm inspired by the deep sense of patriotism of my constituents, and that together we can keep our country a beacon of hope and freedom.  Mail  In the first year of the 116th Congress, my office received over 115,000 letters, phone calls, and email from constituents about issues they care about. I appreciate the time constituents take to write to me, and I want you to know that I personally read and respond to every letter my constituents send to me. I never put out &#8216;group letters&#8217; or &#8216;canned mail&#8217; and I don&#8217;t plan to. I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas.  ---------  2019 has been a historic year in Congress. It has been stressful and it has been productive and there&#8217;s much work to do in 2020. Whether it&#8217;s working to meet the challenges of climate change; ensure Americans have access to affordable health insurance; bring down the cost of prescription drugs; strengthen our privacy rights; protect our environment; or save the free and open Internet, I will continue to be an outspoken champion for my constituents and advance impactful legislation in the second year of the 116th Congress.  Should you have any questions or comments, let me hear from you. I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas. May the New Year be filled with every blessing for you, your family, and our country. It is an honor to represent you and I pledge to continue advancing policies that will strengthen our democracy, our people, our economy, and our values.  With great gratitude,   Anna G.

From providing $1.5 billion in funding and additional flexibility for the State Opioid Response grant program, to supporting the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, to strengthening counterterrorism efforts, to helping fix highways, roads, and bridges, and increasing Pell grants, this bipartisan package contains a lot of measures for New Hampshire to be excited about.  Additionally, I&#8217;m glad that the this funding bill included key bipartisan legislation that I pushed for, including the bipartisan Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber Hunt and Incident Response Teams Act that I introduced with Republican Senator Rob Portman from Ohio to bolster cybersecurity in the public and private sectors.  This package also includes bipartisan legislation I cosponsored to improve prevention and treatment for tick-borne diseases, reverse tax increases on military families and students, and make it easier for Americans to save for retirement.  Furthermore, I am happy to report that the bill contains key tax fixes and incentives to help our economy grow, including extending tax cuts to New Hampshire&#8217;s growing craft beer industry and incentivizing better energy efficiency in homes.  Lastly, I want to wish everyone a very happy holiday season. This has been a tumultuous year for our country, and there will be more challenges to come in the New Year. We have lots of hard work ahead of us in order to tackle the big issues in our communities and in our country. But I know we can do it if we continue to find ways to understand and connect with the people around us. With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On This week, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to crack down on robocalls. This legislation improves the federal government&#8217;s ability to find scammers, increases penalties on those caught and requires call authentication and blocking technology to be made available free of charge to consumers. It now heads to the President&#8217;s desk for a signature. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan also joined a number of her colleagues in sending a letter to Purdue Pharma&#8217;s Board of Directors, calling on them to cancel the reported $1.3 million bonus they plan to give to Purdue Pharma CEO Craig Landau. Learn more here.&nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, Senator Hassan joined the rest of the New Hampshire delegation in announcing $750,000 in federal funding to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to improve quality of care and reduce costs for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with substance use and their infants.

In addition to wonderful family and friends, I&#8217;m grateful for the opportunity to represent a state full of diverse and passionate people &#150; where far more unites us than divides us. It&#8217;s an honor to serve Maryland and be a voice for the issues Marylanders care about, from providing affordable, accessible health care to ensuring our economy works for everyone. While we push to enact national priorities, we must also work to protect the public trust and uphold our democracy. Now that the House has completed its constitutional duty, impeachment will move to the Senate. As we go forward, it&#8217;s up to you &#150; the American people &#150; to demand a fair trial. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell&#8217;s conduct is already extremely troubling and anything but impartial. He has publicly expressed his plan to work in lockstep with the President during the trial and has rejected reasonable requests to allow key fact witnesses to testify. In short, he wants to rig the trial. I hope my other Republican colleagues will agree that we have a duty to get all the facts and do justice. If President Trump and Senate Republicans have nothing to hide, they should have nothing to fear from a fair trial. And that&#8217;s why I believe the House should withhold articles of impeachment as we seek assurances from Senator McConnell that the trial will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner. Through their hearings and sworn-witness testimonies, I believe the House has presented overwhelming evidence in support of the case for impeachment, but &#150; unlike the Senate Republican leader &#150; I welcome additional evidence, including any exculpatory evidence the President wants to produce. I will listen to and fairly weigh any such evidence before rendering a final verdict. That is what a trial is all about. That is our obligation under the Constitution. The American people deserve nothing less.    Good News: Making Vital Investments in our Common Future I&#8217;m pleased that, even amidst the political division, this week the Senate was able to pass legislation to fund important investments throughout our state and our country and to avoid a government shutdown. These bills include a number of key provisions for Maryland &#150; including a historic increase in funds to protect and preserve the Chesapeake Bay. They also provide increased resources to the NIH to achieve its mission of discovering and developing life-saving cures and medical treatments for diseases that impact every American family. Additionally, this package includes critical support for Maryland&#8217;s many top-notch federal agencies and military installations, such as NASA Goddard, Fort Detrick, Fort Meade, NIST, and NOAA. And it invests in important projects within our state, including oyster restoration, dredging to ensure a thriving Port of Baltimore, and WMATA. That being said, while I support strong border security, I opposed the package that included Homeland Security funding because it failed to address one of the President&#8217;s most egregious abuses of power &#150; his actions to steal funding from Congressionally-approved projects to build his inefficient, unnecessary border wall and support his inhumane immigration policy. He has taken funding from projects at Joint Base Andrews, Fort Meade, and other military installations across our country and transferred those monies to the Department of Homeland Security. These losses will have harmful impacts on our military bases, communities, and national security.   Making the American Dream a Reality for More Americans We need to confront the growing wealth gap in this country and counter the Trump Tax Scam with real solutions. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced a Millionaires Surtax to help build a dynamic economy where everyone has a fair shot, instead of a dynastic economy based on existing wealth. Ensuring that millionaires do their part to help our country succeed by investing more in our kids&#8217; education and growing the middle class &#150; rather than concentrating wealth among an increasingly tiny group &#150; isn&#8217;t a partisan idea. It&#8217;s about making the American Dream more real for everyone. My bill calls upon those with the top 0.2% annual income (couples with over $2 million in annual income) to invest more in the success of our country and help open the doors to the American Dream for the other 99.8%. It&#8217;s simple to implement and hard for tax lawyers to game the system by exploiting loopholes. Another key advantage to this approach is that it would apply to both regular income like salaries and to investment income, including stocks. That&#8217;s because, unlike middle-class Americans, very wealthy households often get most of their income from investments off of their wealth rather than from their work. Polling shows that Americans across the political spectrum support it, and I&#8217;ll be working to get this done.   Tackling Challenges Abroad One of the most troubling parts of the impeachment inquiry has been the willingness of many Republican Members of Congress to grasp onto &#150; and spread &#150; &nbsp;the false narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in our 2016 elections. This falsehood is completely inaccurate and an attempt by Putin himself to spread misinformation. We know that Russia interfered in the 2016 election from reports from our own intelligence agencies &#150; the CIA and the FBI. Listening to some Republicans and the President trying to discredit that reality is deeply disturbing. That&#8217;s why I am very frustrated that Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has blocked my bipartisan legislation, the DETER Act, which is designed to prevent interference in our future elections. Since 2016, we have done nothing to let Putin know that future inference in our elections will be met with swift, certain, and very tough penalties on Russia and its economy. This is unacceptable. We should all be able to agree that foreign governments should not interfere in American elections. Earlier this fall, the Senate unanimously voted to include key elements of our bipartisan bill in the National Defense Authorization Act. But the Trump Administration and Mitch McConnell worked behind closed doors to remove these provisions. With the next national election less than a year away, I will continue to push my Republican colleagues to move forward on this urgent priority to protect the integrity of our elections and our democracy.&nbsp; Despite this, I&#8217;m proud to say that Congress has taken a stand when it comes to North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs, and the threat they pose to ourselves and our allies. This week, the Congress passed &#150; as part of the National Defense Authorization Act &#150; my bipartisan legislation to sanction North Korea, the BRINK Act. This bill will provide the needed teeth to enforce international economic sanctions against the North Korean regime. Specifically, the law will impose sanctions on banks and firms that do business with the North Korean regime and fully enforce the economic restrictions called for by the United Nations. The goal is to build the necessary pressure on North Korea to negotiate the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The President&#8217;s repeated photo ops with Kim Jong-un have not achieved our goals. On Wednesday, I was proud to stand alongside the parents of Otto Warmbier &#150; who was killed by this ruthless regime &#150; to announce the passage of our bill to hold the North Korean regime accountable.   Meeting with Marylanders When I&#8217;m not working in the Capitol, I am out meeting folks across our state. Over the last couple of months, I&#8217;ve had the chance to catch up with people everywhere from Hagerstown to Prince Frederick and Baltimore to Chestertown. In October, I also had the chance to visit our troops in Afghanistan, where I met with members of the Maryland National Guard. Whenever I&#8217;m meeting with Marylanders, I&#8217;m grateful for the opportunity to learn about the important things they&#8217;re accomplishing in our state and get feedback on how my team can help. Two of the local visits I&#8217;ve enjoyed recently were with students at the Community College of Baltimore County, Essex Campus and Cecil College. At both colleges, I sat down with students to hear directly from them about the issues they&#8217;re most interested in and concerned about. I discussed our efforts in the Senate to reduce the burden of student loans, increase access to affordable health care, and grow workforce training programs &#150; including through the introduction of my Long-Term Unemployment Elimination Act that utilizes community colleges to get more people ready for work. These visits were a great opportunity to hear from our next generation of leaders. I also recently held two Consumer Protection Forums with Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh &#150; one in Carroll County and another in Howard County &#150; where we discussed how Marylanders can better protect themselves from scams and fraudulent schemes. Following these forums, I&#8217;m proud to announce the Congress has passed new legislation &#150; the TRACED Act &#150; which will increase enforcement and penalties on robocalls. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I was glad Congress could work on a bipartisan basis to get it done before the end of the year. While next year will certainly present new challenges, I wish you a holiday season full of peace and joy!

It will be our last issue in the U.S. Senate before my retirement at the end of 2019. Every day since I was first sworn in to the U.S. Senate on Jan. 4, 2005, it has been a privilege to serve Georgia in this role. I&#8217;ve done my very best to make sure Georgians&#8217; best interests are reflected in my votes and policy work.  During these last several months since I announced my retirement, I&#8217;ve taken time to thank my staff, friends, supporters and family. Without them, we would not have reached the level of success we&#8217;ve achieved thus far, nor would it have been as gratifying. The relationships we have built have been so meaningful, and I will carry them with me always.  Traveling our beautiful state and working with Georgians from Rabun Gap to Tybee Light to represent commonsense, conservative values and deliver meaningful results has been a joy, regardless of the political climate or season. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the opportunity of a lifetime. In the Senate  At the time of this writing, the U.S. House passed two bills on Tuesday&nbsp;packaging together the 12 full-year appropriations bills to fund the government for fiscal year 2020, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measures later this week.  Several&nbsp;provisions I supported to help Georgians are included in the final measures:   Full funding for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for fiscal year 2020 to keep this number one economic development project for our state on track. The Hurricanes Florence and Michael and California Wildfire Tax Relief Act, to provide relief to victims of Hurricane Michael and other natural disasters from 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Preserving America&#8217;s Battlefields Act to help ensure our nation&#8217;s living memorials honoring those who fought for our freedoms are protected for current and future generations. The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, called the SECURE Act, to improve retirement preparations, encourage saving for retirement and help ensure hardworking Americans can plan in advance so they do not outlive their retirement savings. Funding for new resources to modernize public health data collection at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and across the country. Permanent repeal of Obamacare&#8217;s taxes on medical devices and health insurance, protecting consumers from the cost of these taxes and removing a burden on innovators and American manufacturers in the life sciences sector.  Improvements for Veterans  One of the areas I&#8217;m most proud of during my time in the U.S. Senate is our work on behalf of our nation&#8217;s proud veterans. During the last five years while I have been chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs, we have fundamentally changed the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to be more responsive to the veterans it serves. I am proud of how far we have come, and I hope the committee will continue this progress to ensure veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve. Since 2015, the Senate has passed nearly 60 pieces of legislation that originated in our committee to improve accountability at the VA, expand VA education benefits, modernize the process for veterans&#8217; appeals of benefit determinations, and overhaul the VA&#8217;s community care programs. You can read more about our work here. Commitment to Education  Our children are the message we send to the future, so whether it&#8217;s been in the Georgia general assembly, the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate or as chairman of the Georgia Board of Education, I&#8217;ve worked on education issues to help better the lives of future generations.      This week, we released the latest video in a series focusing on my career. I want to thank my colleagues who contributed to the video and everyone who has helped me better serve our young people through improved education policy. What&#8217;s On Tap?  In early January, Senator-designate Kelly Loeffler will be sworn in to the seat I have occupied in the U.S. Senate.&nbsp; This will be our final e-Newsletter. However, I look forward to remaining as active as possible in Georgia after my retirement from the U.S. Senate on Dec. 31.  Thank you again for this honor of a lifetime.

On December 7th, millions of Americans across the country paused to remember the attack on Pearl Harbor and the events that brought the United States fully into the Second World War. I spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate recognizing the 78th anniversary of this dark chapter of American history and the three remaining survivors of the USS Arizona. I&#8217;m thankful to the men and women who serve our country and fight for our nation each and every day &#150; people like Ken Potts, Lou Conter, and Donald Stratton, who continue to remind us each and every moment why this nation is worth fighting for.  Supporting Space Command and Service Members in Colorado  I hosted Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in Centennial for a discussion with members of Colorado&#8217;s defense community about the future of Space Command in Colorado and ensuring our service members have the support they need. Colorado&#8217;s service members exemplify the best of our nation, and I&#8217;m working with Chairman Inhofe to make sure they have the resources and support necessary to fulfill their missions.  Senate Passes My Legislation to Simplify the Student Loan Application Process The United States Senate recently passed bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) filing process for nearly 20 million students and their families.  According to the Colorado Department of Education, over 50 percent of Colorado high school graduates did not finish their FAFSA in the 2015-2016 academic year. Those students could have been eligible for almost $50 million more in federal support to further their education had they completed the form. The current system is unnecessarily burdensome at 108 questions long, and my bipartisan Faster Access to Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Act will allow students to answer at least 11 and as many as 22 questions with just one click.  No student should have to miss out on educational opportunities because completing their forms was more difficult than it needed to be, and I applaud the Senate for passing this bipartisan legislation to make the complex process easier for students and their parents.  Enhancing Opportunity Zones Opportunity Zones are making a positive impact and driving new investments in Colorado. I introduced the bipartisan IMPACT Act&nbsp;to provide new data on Opportunity Zones, so we can make them as effective as possible to encourage investment, spur growth, and extend opportunities for communities across all four corners of Colorado. As a fifth generation Coloradan who grew up on the Eastern Plains, I know how important it is to attract growth to local communities and particularly rural communities, and I&#8217;ll continue working to make Opportunity Zones as effective as possible.  Demanding an Investigation Into the Loan Forgiveness Process A recent report from National Public Radio (NPR) found that hundreds of thousands of Americans with qualifying disabilities have not received the student loan relief they are entitled to by law. I sent a letter with Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) and a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the U.S. Department of Education urging the department&#8217;s Acting Inspector General to investigate the federal student loan discharge process for Americans with total and permanent disabilities (TPD). I&#8217;m alarmed by this extremely low rate of loan discharges and the contrast between these findings and the information previously provided by the Education Department. It appears the department&#8217;s process for TPD loan discharges is failing to provide student loan relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, including veterans, who are entitled to this relief under law. Safeguarding Consumer Privacy   Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner's remarks.  In Colorado, we cherish our personal privacy, which is at the core of our Rocky Mountain values. At a hearing held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I spoke about my work to protect consumer data privacy. We discussed privacy as a fundamental human right, the use of facial recognition technology by the Chinese Communist Party, and my bipartisan Protecting Privacy in our Homes Act. I strongly support efforts to support a national, bipartisan privacy policy that respects Colorado&#8217;s values, America&#8217;s values, consumer choice, and the appropriate safeguarding of our private lives. Addressing Ransomware Threats  Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) and I, as bipartisan co-chairs of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, received a classified briefing from Chris Krebs, Director of the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, to discuss the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is costly, devastatingly high-impact, and in most cases, easily preventable with basic responsible cybersecurity practices. Ransomware&#8217;s continued prevalence should capture our nation&#8217;s attention, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus to address this important issue.  Concerns About China&#8217;s Corporate Social Credit System Senator Michael Bennet and I sent a bipartisan letter to the United States Trade Representative with 23 of our colleagues outlining our concerns with the Chinese government&#8217;s efforts to develop and deploy its Corporate Social Credit System (Corporate SCS). The Corporate SCS represents China formalizing a system to punish American companies and workers for speaking out against the Chinese government. In the letter, we ask Ambassador Lighthizer to prioritize research and analysis into the Corporate SCS and the implications that a system like this may pose for American workers, companies, and investors. Our American values are not for sale, and that&#8217;s why we should track China&#8217;s efforts to coerce American companies into complying with their flawed system.

On Friday, Chairman Nadler and the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted 23 YEA and 17 NAY on party lines &#8211; to send two articles of impeachment - abuse of power, and obstruction of Congress to the House floor next week.&nbsp; Sadly, this comes as no surprise, because Democrats have wanted to impeach President Trump since the day he was elected, more than three years. Since then, Democrats have manufactured an endless litany of &#8220;scandals&#8221; in the hopes of overturning the results of the 2016 election. &nbsp;  The exchange between President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine did not demonstrate impeachable conduct. The partisan Articles of Impeachment voted out of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday are very weak and at best utilize an ambiguous standard. Democrats&#8217; relentless and obsessive hatred of the President has completely crippled their ability to govern and to deliver bipartisan solutions for the American people.  Hamilton warned us of this day in the Federalist Papers, he worried as the constitution was written that one-day impeachment would be used as a political tool, in order to overturn the will of the American people. We cannot allow our political process to start weaponizing impeachment against political opponents.   Click Video     USMCA  More than a year ago, President Trump signed an agreement with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to revolutionize the way we do business with our top trading partners. Tuesday, the United States- Mexico- Canada trade Agreement was ready to be ratified.  The USMCA is a big win for Pennsylvania and the people of Lancaster and York counties. The USMCA will create new opportunities for Americans in every sector of our economy. Our farmers have been hurting for a longtime, especially our dairy farmers, this agreement will open new markets in Canada and Mexico that will help to maintain and expand their sales. The USMCA will improve and modernize trade for American Farmers, American Manufactures, and the American workforce in PA-11. This week, I had the opportunity to talk with Varney &amp; Co on Fox business, and The Greg Barton radio show about the USMCA and the President&#8217;s visit to Hershey Pennsylvania.&nbsp;  Click Video    Greg Barton Interview  Click Video     The National Defense Authorization Act  This week the House passed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization act (NDAA) for FY20, it included two of my amendments &#8211; The Defense Small Business Advancement Act which permanently reauthorizes the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s Mentor- Prot&#233;g&#233; program with some additional accountability measures, and The Warrior Wellness Act that requires the Department of Defense to submit a report that details the exact shortage of mental health providers at the DOD no later than 180 days after enactment.  NDAA Highlights  The fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes $738 billion in defense funding, provides a 3.1% military pay-raise, and rejects restrictions on the President&#8217;s authorities to secure our borders. This bill also:   Provides the resources to continue to rebuild readiness, advance modernization of the nuclear triad, develop emerging technologies, enhance missile defense, and confront our adversaries. &nbsp; Maintains long-standing prohibitions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay, constructing detention facilities in the U.S., and closing Guantanamo. Provides an additional $5.3 billion in emergency funding for military installations damaged by natural disasters. Establishes the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the military. Provides up to 12 weeks of Paid Parental Leave for the Defense Department, Intelligence Community, and across the federal government, a key administration priority.  &nbsp;For more details on the NDAA please read my press release here.   ROBOCALL BILL  On April 3rd, 2019, I joined with my colleagues and introduced a bill to deter robocalls in the U.S. called the TRACED Act, which passed the House with bipartisan support. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass) introduced the Senate companion bill (S. 151), which had 22 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the Senate. December 5th 2019, the TRACED Act was sent to President Trumps desk and he&#8217;s expected to sign this important legislation into law, to help cut down on the nuisance of robocalls.  Spam calling has gotten out of hand. Day after day, too many Americans receive countless phone calls from suspicious numbers. Not only are these calls a nuisance, they are dangerous since wrongdoers can prey on vulnerable people and commit crimes with their information. Both sides of the aisle have come together to agree robocalls are endlessly irritating, I urge the President to sign this commonsense measure and help put an end to this frustrating practice once and for all. For more information on the TRACED Act click here.   Raw Milk Bill  This week, I joined eighteen members of Congress to introduce a bipartisan bill to allow Interstate Traffic of Raw Milk. &nbsp; The Interstate Milk Freedom Act (H.R. 5410) prohibits federal interference with the interstate traffic of unpasteurized milk and milk products that are packaged for direct human consumption. &nbsp; It&#8217;s legal to drink raw milk in 50 states, and to sell raw milk in 28 states. Congress has never passed a ban on raw milk. Yet, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did so in capitulation to a lawsuit. &nbsp; Raw milk is a niche product highly valued by educated consumers who understand any risks associated with its consumption. This industry is vital economically for many small family farms in Lancaster and York counties, who survive and thrive by selling directly to the consumer. Farmers&nbsp;throughout Pennsylvania&#8217;s 11th District and the nation work tirelessly to ensure safe, nutritious dairy products are available to everyone. Small family farms have been consuming and distributing raw milk safely for hundreds of years. &nbsp;  This bill rightly gets the federal government out of the way and decriminalizes farmers and producers who choose to sell or take unpasteurized milk and other dairy products to willing customers throughout the nation.&nbsp;For more information on The Interstate Milk Freedom Act click here.   Examining the Education Department&#8217;s Implementation of Borrower Defense  This week, in the Committee on Education and Labor which I am a member of, we had Secretary DeVos appear before the Committee to discuss the Department of Education&#8217;s work to address borrowers&#8217; defense claims that have been filed with the Department. &nbsp; Committee Democrats decided instead of using the committee time to have a constructive dialog with the Secretary on the issue, instead they used taxpayers&#8217; time and money to insult and attack Secretary DeVos and Committee Republicans. Their comments were unnecessary and offensive.&nbsp; &nbsp; Here are my remarks:  Click Video     District Spotlight  Happy Birthday Pennsylvania!

Hershey With The President  This week I had the opportunity to travel with the President to Hershey Pennsylvania. Here are a few highlights:  I had the opportunity to meet and spend some time with Harold Billow- he is the last local survivor and is believed to be the last remaining survivor of the Malmedy Massacre that took place on Dec. 17, 1944 at the Baugnez Crossroads in Belgium.

I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to help lead the Senate subcommittee on African Affairs and serve in other capacities to advance U.S. national security interests through global leadership. I&#8217;m proud of what we have been able to achieve.&nbsp;    I was recently honored by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition with its Lifetime Achievement Award for my longstanding commitment to advocating for a strong U.S. foreign policy and strengthening America&#8217;s development and diplomacy tools worldwide. A video was released to accompany the award, and you can watch it by clicking .  Major Win for Georgia On Thursday, court-appointed Special Master Paul Kelly recommended that the U.S. Supreme Court dismiss Florida&#8217;s case against Georgia over water rights that has been under litigation for years. The Supreme Court must now decide whether or not to act on the case, or whether Kelly or another judge must review it again.  Georgia has consistently focused on conservation efforts to ensure that we are good stewards of our water resources. This ruling reaffirms the evidence-based argument presented to Special Master Kelly by the state&#8217;s attorneys, and we look forward to the U.S. Supreme Court issuing a decision that proves the merits of Georgia&#8217;s position in this case soon.  In the Senate During the last three years, the Senate has confirmed 50 circuit court judges appointed by President Donald Trump, more than any president&#8217;s first full term since 1980. In Georgia, the Senate has confirmed eight judges to our nation&#8217;s federal courts during that time.&nbsp;    Over-the-Counter Medication Improvements I am so glad to share that on Tuesday, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation I introduced and have worked on for a number of years to overhaul the way over-the-counter medications are regulated and brought to market. I reintroduced this legislation earlier this year because while modern medicine is constantly improving and adapting as research offers new information, the regulatory system is outdated, putting consumer health at risk and hindering innovation that could benefit all Americans.  The Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act, S.2740, will help ensure that Americans have effective, accessible health products in their medicine cabinets and on supermarket shelves. In addition, the legislation will ensure innovations can be made well into the future and that we are promoting competition to bring down costs for consumers. I hope the House will quickly follow suit in passing this measure.  In Other News  On Tuesday, I was glad to join Senate-designate Kelly Loeffler at the weekly Senate Republican Conference lunch as she continues planning to begin her work here fulltime in January. I have pledged to work closely with Kelly to ensure a smooth transition as I retire on Dec. 31.   I am also glad to report that the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Reauthorization Act of 2019 passed in committee this week! I introduced this bipartisan measure last week to help protect children by providing states with the support they need to combat child abuse and neglect.  What&#8217;s On Tap? As we approach the end of the year, I am still hard at work fighting for Georgia&#8217;s legislative priorities. Current government funding expires on Dec. 20, and it is essential that our government remains funded to avoid any interruption to critical services and benefits.

I committed to taking on the pharmaceutical industry and setting a new standard of protection for American workers, consumers and the environment. Yesterday, Democrats came to a new agreement on the United States Mexico Canada trade pact that brings about radical change to U.S. trade policy. I was one of the eight members of Congress that Speaker Pelosi appointed to work on this agreement and we have been working hard over the last six months. If you were to look at what the administration submitted to us and what the final agreement came out to, the differences couldn't be more stark. We were able to strip out protections for prescription drug companies, which is the first time that the pharmaceutical industry has lost a battle like this. We also secured a first-of-its-kind rapid-response labor enforcement mechanism and new resources for enforcement of environmental protections at the southern border. As a result, this is actually the first trade deal in nearly 20 years that has been endorsed by AFL-CIO. And there's more bad news for big pharma. This week the House is poised to pass H.R. 3, the Elijah Cummings Lowering Drug Prices Act, giving Medicare the power to negotiate directly with drug companies and stop them from ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the same drugs. I led the charge against the pharmaceutical industry and won. I'm going to keep fighting to lower drug prices for all Americans and ensure that our trade policies match our progressive values.

We are here to help.  &nbsp;  Mahalo,  &nbsp;  Brian Schatz  United States Senator                Schatz Legislation Expected to Become Law Several pieces of legislation authored by Senator Schatz are set to become law after being included in the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).&nbsp; The legislation was introduced as individual bills and incorporated into the bipartisan NDAA package.&nbsp; The four provisions are:  Providing Paid Parental Leave for Federal Workers  This bill provides two&nbsp;million federal workers with 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child after birth, adoption, or the initiation of foster care.&nbsp;  Although the current Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care of a new child, it does not provide any paid leave. Studies have shown that providing paid leave for federal employees would save the government at least $50 million annually in turnover and replacement costs. Federal agencies are already struggling to recruit and retain young talent. Just 6 percent of the federal workforce is under the age of 30, while roughly 40 percent of the workforce is eligible to retire within the next three years.  Improving the Emergency Alert System  The Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats (ALERT) Act, which was introduced by Senator Schatz following the false emergency alert that went out across Hawai&#8216;i in January 2018, will improve the emergency alert system and give the federal government the primary responsibility of alerting the public of a missile threat. State and local governments have been largely responsible for alerting the public of threats from natural disasters and severe weather. With various government agencies issuing alerts, the system has relied on an inconsistent patchwork of technologies and procedures established by each agency. The false alarm in Hawai&#8216;i highlighted some of the weaknesses in the state&#8217;s emergency alert system, which had a poorly designed user interface and did not have a sufficient verification system or computer redundancies to help prevent mistakes. The incident made clear the need for federal standards in the system and called into question the state&#8217;s responsibility to issue a missile alert.  Protecting Military Bases from Extreme Weather  The Requiring Every American Defense Installation to Nullify Environmental Stresses for Security (READINESS) Act protects military bases from extreme weather events by requiring them to prepare for potential disasters and other risks posed by severe changes in environmental conditions. The new law will require that all Department of Defense bases have military installation resilience plans that:   Include the current risks and threats to military resilience resulting from extreme weather events, change in sea level, flooding, and wildfires&#151;and describe the impact on critical infrastructure inside and outside the military base that are necessary to its mission; Include the future risks and threats to military resilience during the 50-year lifespan of the base resulting from extreme weather events and other environmental conditions; Describe the projects necessary to mitigate the identified risks to the military base&#151;including the costs and types of agreements with community stakeholders necessary to execute the military installation resilience plan; and Use projections from recognized governmental and scientific entities, such as the National Academies of Sciences, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S. Global Change Research Office, to inform future risk assessments.  Fighting Trafficking of Child Pornography  The End National Defense (END) Network Abuse Act will help the Pentagon stop the unacceptable use of the Defense Department&#8217;s (DoD) network to view, possess, trade, procure, and even produce child pornography. Across the internet, more than 45 million online images and videos of child sexual abuse material were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.&nbsp; In 2018, the DoD&#8217;s network ranked 19th out of 2,891 networks nationwide when it came to peer-to-peer file trading of child pornography. Coupled with these troubling statistics is a lack of training and law enforcement tools for the DoD to take on child sexual exploitation. The END Network Abuse Act would upgrade the training and technical capacity of military criminal investigative organizations to confront the misuse of the DoD&#8217;s computers, facilities, and equipment to access and trade child pornography. It would also require the DoD to enter into collaborative agreements with appropriate federal, state and local law enforcement entities, child protection organizations, trauma informed health care providers, and targeted social services.   Securing Federal Disaster Relief Funding The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that Hawai&#8216;i will receive $26 million in new federal disaster relief funding. The new Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding adds to the $71 million announced earlier this year, and will help state and local governments rebuild impacted communities, especially in low- and moderate-income areas, and provide resources to help businesses recover. U.S. Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked with federal agencies and state and county officials to ensure Hawai&#8216;i submitted a strong application to receive the maximum amount of funding. The new funding allocation was part of the $1.7 billion housing disaster recovery package Congress passed last year.    With the $26 million in housing and community development grants announced today, Hawai&#8216;i has now been allocated more than a half a billion dollars in federal disaster relief funding to help the state recover from the historic storms in April 2018, Hurricane Lane, and the eruption of Kilauea on Hawai&#8216;i Island including:   $15.3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in&nbsp;individual assistance to help people who have lost their home; $205 million from FEMA in public assistance to help local and state governments clean up and repair public infrastructure such as facilities, parks, and water lines; $93.1 million from the Department of Transportation to help rebuild roads and highways; $80 million from the Department of the Interior to help repair damages at the Hawai&#8216;i Volcanoes Observatory and the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge; $71 million from the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development for housing and community development; $47.2 million from the Small Business Administration in subsidized loans to help individuals and businesses pay for repairs not covered by insurance; $4 million from the Department of Labor in Disaster Unemployment&nbsp;Insurance to help those who lost their job temporarily or permanently because of a disaster and are not eligible for regular unemployment benefits; and $187,000 from the Economic Development Administration to provide technical assistance for economic development activities in disaster impacted areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    The Senate Committee on the Climate Crisis, chaired by Senator Schatz, also held a hearing on how we can help communities rebuild after severe weather.&nbsp; To watch the hearing, click here.   Protecting Our Personal Data Online Senator Schatz, the top Democrat on the Senate Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee, led a group of 16 senators in reintroducing legislation to protect people&#8217;s personal data online. The Data Care Act would require websites, apps, and other online providers to take responsible steps to safeguard personal information and stop the misuse of users&#8217; data.  Doctors, lawyers, and bankers are legally required to exercise special care to protect their clients and not misuse their information. While online companies also hold personal and sensitive information about the people they serve, they are not required to protect consumers&#8217; data. This leaves users in a vulnerable position: they are expected to understand the information they give to providers and how it is being used &#150; an unreasonable expectation for even the most tech-savvy consumer. By establishing an explicit duty for online providers, Americans can trust that their online data is protected and used in a responsible way.    Senator Schatz also questioned witnesses at a Commerce Committee hearing entitled \"Examining Legislative Proposals to Protect Consumer Data Privacy.\"&nbsp; To watch the full hearing, click here.

As Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats continue their partisan impeachment sham, they have now introduced&nbsp;Articles of Impeachment. Even though they don't have the evidence and have orchestrated an unfair process, they have put the goals of their far-left wing base ahead of their responsibility to serving the country. On another note, after a year of dragging her feet, Pelosi has agreed to President Trump's United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The House has also considered the Conference Report for the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act in order to fund our national defense and give our men and women in uniform the resources they deserve.  &nbsp;   United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement After the Democrat majority held off a floor vote for months while playing politics, Speaker Pelosi has finally agreed to President Trump's trade deal and will bring the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to the House floor for a vote. As a member of the committee that handles trade &#8211; the House Ways and Means Committee &#8211; it has been an honor to work with Ranking Member Kevin Brady and other Committee members to support the efforts of President Trump and the administration to renegotiate NAFTA. This is clearly a better deal for American businesses and workers.  This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation. By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive. After years of sluggish recovery, our economy is booming again and growing 50 percent faster than projected. America is once again the most competitive place in the world to do business and thanks to the hard work of President Trump, the USMCA will help continue that growth. I was proud to be the conservative voice in the room at the White House to emphasize the trade priorities of my neighbors in the Third District, and again in Ottawa with Ways and Means Committee members to voice the importance of this trade agreement. As Chief Deputy Whip, I will have the honor of working alongside Republican Whip Steve Scalise to deliver a big vote in support of President Trump&#8217;s trade deal.  &nbsp;   Photo of the Week   Meeting with Whip Scalise and the USMCA Whip team to chat about the upcoming vote. &nbsp;   Congressional Spring Internship Interested in spending a semester in Washington, D.C. interning on Capitol Hill?

Last week, I supported the TRACED Act to help protect vulnerable people from incessant robocalls. Specifically, the TRACED Act increases civil forfeiture penalties for those who are caught illegally spamming people with fraudulent and harmful calls. It creates a nationwide caller authentication system to drastically improve the accuracy of caller ID systems and help consumers block unlawful calls at no extra charge. Finally, the bill also seeks to harmonize coordinated efforts among federal and state agencies prosecuting robocallers. Illegal robocalls are insidious in nature and prey on seniors. More often than not, robocallers are looking to scare vulnerable people into giving up whatever savings they have, using tactics like fake threats of having their social security benefits canceled or the fake threat of jail time. These scammers also target other groups with dishonest and fraudulent claims, including disabled veterans or families caring for children with disabilities. They violate our privacy and are an unsolicited burden to many of my constituents. This legislation helps rein in these calls and punish those who disgustingly prey on vulnerable people. The inconvenience and burden of illegal robocalls is something too many of us have experienced. It is time to protect all Americans from these attacks and bolster our capability to block illegal robocalls.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_____________  I also had the opportunity to pen an opinion editorial in the Washington Examiner, responding to Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s comments that she is doubtful that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will be ready for a vote before the end of the year. In it, I highlighted the importance of the new e-commerce provisions, highlighting one of the ways in which the agreement modernizes our current trade laws.    When the original transcontinental agreement was signed in 1994, the concept of e-commerce (the tool that revolutionized direct-to-consumer business and opened the market to small and locally owned businesses) was still an idea of the future.  This agreement creates new provisions that delves into these areas that were never discussed in the original agreement, despite how important e-commerce has become to our economy, further underscoring just how outdated our current trade rules are.  It is past time to approve this agreement, creating 176,000 new jobs and spurring $68 billion in new economic growth and modern protections for small businesses hang in the balance.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_____________  This week, I had the opportunity to meet with some very special guests in Washington D.C., coming by my office or in the hallways of Congress. out and about the U.S. Capitol. I always love running into such special people in our nation&#8217;s capital.    I was &#8220;stormed with kindness&#8221; by military spouses this Giving Tuesday! I was humbled they would present me with a special sticker for my support and was privileged to present each of them my challenge coin as a token of my appreciation for them.  Our military families sacrifice so much while our brave service members keep us safe. I am not remiss to their daily, quiet struggles and sacrifices and I am so thankful for all they do. &nbsp;  Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of chatting with my good friend Vice President Mike Pence at the Capitol.&nbsp;It&#8217;s an honor to work with him and President Trump to rebuild the military, grow the economy, and stand strong for our fundamental values.  District Update Broadband access is an issue that is critical to MO-4. Simply put, too many residents of our district, our state, and our country lack access to high quality Internet service. In fact, Missouri ranks 41st in the nation for broadband coverage, with more than one-third of rural Missourians not having access to broadband Internet. This is unacceptable!  This is why I was pleased to see county and city officials in Boone County holding a Broadband Summit to discuss the problems and possible solutions. One of my staff members, Steve Walsh, was among the panelists at this event, sharing some of my ideas for addressing the issue. He was able to share information regarding my amendment to the Farm Bill that increased the baseline speed for broadband programs, ensuring we are investing federal dollars in technology for the future and my amendment expanding funding available for broadband by enabling federal loan guarantees.    Missouri Agriculture Director Chris Chinn addressed the Broadband Summit, explaining that internet service is poor in the rural area in which she resides. I was proud she was recently appointed to the Federal Communications Commission committee tasked with exploring ways to expand rural broadband and the implications of agriculture. This committee is the result of another amendment I successfully passed in the 2018 Farm Bill.&nbsp;  Dr. Chinn will represent Missouri and agriculture well on this important committee. I look forward to seeing their recommendations.  Additionally, I helped pass funding for the USDA investments of more than $1 billion into programs supporting access to rural broadband through the ReConnect grant program and encouraging local entities to apply.&nbsp; Rural Missourians should not be second-class citizens. The economies and livelihoods of rural communities depend as much on being connected as do those in urban areas.&nbsp;  Constituent Update If you&#8217;re a veteran who has been denied the benefits you believe you have earned, denial is not the end of the road. You have every right to appeal the rejection decision, and our office stands ready to assist you in any way. Feel free to contact Janna Worsham in the Columbia office at 573-442-9311. Janna will have you fill out a privacy form that allows her to ask questions on your behalf. She will then open a case to see whether your appeal will be successful.

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Visiting the U.S.-Mexico Border This week, I traveled to Rio Rico, Arizona to visit the U.S.-Mexico border for a tour led by U.S. Border Patrol and an Operations and Drug Threat briefing from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). During my visit, I witnessed first-hand the efforts of our law enforcement to interdict drugs and stop crime at our southern border, and the need for more resources to keep our nation safe.    I have long recognized our immigration system is broken, and I look forward to returning to work in Washington with first-hand knowledge of our border crisis. Thank you to all the law enforcement officers who work tirelessly to protect our borders. A special thanks to U.S. Border Patrol Acting Patrol Agent in Charge Agent Kevin Hecht and DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Apolonio &#8220;Polo&#8221; Ruiz for hosting me at the Arizona-Mexico border.    It is Time to Pass USMCA On Tuesday, I&nbsp;spoke&nbsp;on the Senate floor regarding the importance of passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada and Mexico are Kansas&#8217; top two export markets and this trade agreement would provide certainty for farmers and ranchers while protecting the supply chain for Kansas manufacturers. I was able to highlight my time at the Kansas Farm Bureau townhall last week where farmers, ranchers and agriculture leaders expressed the importance of trade and the need to pass USMCA. I also noted USMCA&#8217;s role in protecting the integrated North American supply chain critical to the many manufacturers &#150; aerospace, aviation, automobile, farm equipment and numerous others &#150; that call Kansas home. Twenty-five percent of the manufacturers in our state, mostly small- to medium-sized businesses, export to Canada and Mexico. USMCA was signed over a year ago, and it is time for the House to pass this important agreement.    Questioning Panel on Consumer Data PrivacyOn Wednesday, as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I&nbsp;participated&nbsp;in a hearing with a panel of industry stakeholders and advocates to discuss legislative proposals to protect consumer data privacy. We discussed a variety of legislative proposals put forward to address issues related to the privacy and security of consumers&#8217; personal information.&nbsp;As the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection with jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission, I have held hearings, briefings, and met with multiple subject matter experts and stakeholders in the interest of developing a federal privacy framework that will provide strong protections for consumers nationwide, including bolstering the FTC&#8217;s existing enforcement authorities and resources.&nbsp;I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on the committee towards enacting a bipartisan federal privacy bill that will offer Kansans and all Americans the privacy assurances they deserve.    Supporting the Senate Hunger Caucus Food Drive As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I helped host a Senate Holiday Food Drive over the past weeks. Senate offices in Washington, D.C. have collected food for needy families, which will be given to the Capital Area Food Bank at the conclusion of the drive this week. I am thankful for the food my office collected to help hungry families this Christmas season. Special thanks to my staff member Judd Gardner for his leadership on this year's drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the time of year to come together as a community and help those less fortunate than ourselves, and food drives are a great way to help those in need. In 2018, it&#8217;s estimated that more than 37 million people in the U.S. were food insecure, including 371 thousand Kansans. I appreciate the organizations in Kansas that are helping to end hunger in our state, including Harvesters Food Bank and the Kansas Food Bank, which feeds thousands of families across Kansas.    Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

I'm excited to say our agreement between the House and the Senate to end robocalls was passed by the House this week. I've been working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee on this legislation to finally end robocalls once and for all. It is estimated that there were nearly 48 billion robocalls in 2018 nationwide. This is an increase of more than 64 percent since 2016. Robocalls are more than just a nuisance. They can scam consumers and even block hospital phone lines. The Senate is expected to officially approve the agreement soon. I look forward to President Trump finally signing this critical legislation into law. Also this week, House Democrats continued their impeachment sham. Shockingly, Democrats brought liberal professors to Congress to give their opinions. However, you can't impeach the President of the United States based on opinions. You need facts, and the Democrats do not have a case for impeachment. Catch up on these issues and more in this week's Buddy's Briefing. Click here to watch Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXLI Monday, December 2, 2019: Im in Alma in Bacon County early this morning as I am hosting an H2A roundtable discussion designed to bring local farmers together with federal and state agencies that deal with the program. The H2A program is a federal program that allows employers to apply for guest workers from other countries to perform seasonal or temporary farm work for a maximum of ten months. Representatives from the four main agencies involved in this process, United States Citizens and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Labor (DOL), Homeland Security, and Department of State (DOS), join us at the roundtable via telephone. Those physically attending the meeting are representatives from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Georgia DOL. Rep. Carter hosts an H2A roundtable discussion Each agency briefly describes their role in the H2A process and offers suggestions as to best practices for the employers before answering questions of the employers. Afterwards, I fly to Atlanta where I join the Ripon Society on their Atlanta Main Street Policy Tour as we visit corporate sites in the city to learn more about the major companies in the area. Our first stop is IBM where we tour the X-Force Exchange, a cloud-based threat intelligence platform that allows the company to consume, share and act on threat intelligence through human and artificial intelligence (AI).

Tuesday, December 3, 2019: This morning we visit yet another great Georgia company, Delta Airlines, whose headquarters are at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL) and where we have a behind-the-scenes look at how the airport operates. ATL is the worlds busiest airline hub with over 7,000 airport customer service employees working above-wing, below-wing and in cargo. Georgia has been home to Delta for over 75 years and Delta has over 36,000 employees based in the state. Delta operates 76% of Georgia-based flights and served over 81 million passengers worldwide in 2018.  Reps. Carter and Bucshon visiting Delta After a great tour, I head back to Washington (via Delta, of course), and head straight to the Senate Chamber at the Capitol where I am present to hear a true Georgia icon, Senior Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA), give his farewell address. One of my political mentors, Sen. Isakson delivers an emotional plea for bi-partisanship that this true statesman has practiced and exemplified throughout his sterling career. Afterwards, I head to my office on the House side where I meet with my friend Mark Mirza who travels from Georgia to the Capitol on a regular basis to pray with members of the delegation.

Continue reading this brief update to learn more about my work on your behalf last week.  Stopping Robocalls  Robocalls have become more than just a nuisance. They are a tool for scammers to prey upon the most vulnerable in our society, the elderly and disabled. Illegal robocalls perpetuate fraud, threaten personal privacy, and undermine our telecommunications system. Last week, a bill I helped create to fight the plague of robocalls passed the House. I believe it will go a long way in giving the FCC the tools it needs to prosecute these scammers and shutdown illegal robocall operations. My hope is that my Senate colleagues will expedite the bill's passage and it will go to the President to become law very soon.  Advocating for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  The suicide crisis is a multi-faceted national crisis - not a Veteran-specific one - and it is going to take a government and society wide effort to solve it. Since only six of the 20 servicemembers and Veterans per day who are taking their lives are receiving healthcare services at VA, we must empower VA to work with community partners to reach those most in need. Sadly, during last week&#8217;s VA Committee Markup, Chairman Takano missed the opportunity to work in a bipartisan manner with our bill, the IMPROVE Act, which was originally designed as a bipartisan measure to help achieve this important goal. While I appreciate the Chairman&#8217;s intent and know that we have a common goal, by pushing a partisan substitute amendment he has made it much less likely that the IMPROVE Act will garner the bipartisan support it would need to pass the Senate. This is extremely disappointing and could have negative consequences for our nation&#8217;s heroes. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my comments during the hearing. Despite this setback, I remain hopeful that we can work together in the coming weeks to do the right thing for Veterans. To learn more about the IMPROVE Act, as originally introduced, click here. Additionally, last week my team had the opportunity to visit the construction site of the future VA Outpatient Clinic on Little Road in New Port Richey. During the visit, my team was able to talk with the fine folks who are working hard to make the dream of this new, expanded clinic a reality. According to the project foreman: the grading, cutting, and balancing of the earth is almost complete. Within the next few days, his crew will begin working on the building's foundation. It is exciting to see this important project finally come to fruition, as the new facility will allow more Veterans to receive quality care closer to home.   Helping Seniors  Last week, I reintroduced the Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act of 2019 (H.R. 5333). This legislation will help millions of seniors on Medicare by ensuring more timely access to the treatments they need. Additionally, there are more than 600 medical device companies in our state working to develop innovative and effective products. During a roundtable discussion in my district, I heard from many of these businesses about how these lengthy and unnecessary Medicare coverage delays create a significant barrier in bringing new products to market. This bill is about connecting patients with important devices and technologies more quickly. Additionally, it is about encouraging innovation rather than stifling it. Government has to get out of the way and streamline the payment process for effective new devices that can ultimately help improve and save lives.  Specifically, this bill will guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to cutting-edge medical innovation by streamlining the coverage determination process and improving the availability of breakthrough devices for patients. Currently, Medicare does not automatically cover the latest advances in medical technology, even when the products are approved through the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (FDA) breakthrough pathway process. Medicare&#8217;s coverage determination for FDA approved products can take up to three years, delaying vital treatments to millions of seniors. The Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act would require Medicare to temporarily cover all breakthrough products approved through the FDA&#8217;s breakthrough pathway for a three-year period, during which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must make a permanent coverage determination.&nbsp; Facilitating Financial Success  Despite slowing growth around the world, last week&#8217;s Jobs Report shows that the U.S. economy remains a bright spot, thanks to lower taxes and fewer burdensome regulations. Watch this&nbsp;video to learn more. &nbsp;  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following message from a constituent after her father&#8217;s passport was stolen while he was visiting Paris.  &#8220;Thank you, Kristen and Tucker of Representative Bilirakis&#8217;s office in Pinellas County. Dad is now able to come home! These ladies made sure a temporary passport was being processed before they left (LATE) on Thanksgiving break! You&#8217;re America&#8217;s finest and we could not have done it without you!&#8221; This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team enjoyed the YMCA Suncoast West Pasco Prayer Breakfast last week. It is wonderful to see so many leaders praying for our community.   I&#8217;m very excited that my team had the opportunity to begin an important conversation with the leaders of Dunedin Elementary School and Dunedin City Commissioner Deborah Kynes about a potential mental health pilot project that will provide additional services for at risk youth. It is my belief that early intervention can make a tremendous difference.   My team also enjoyed participating in last week's graduation ceremony from the transition preparation program at the Zephyrhills Correctional Institute. This voluntary program prepares inmates who are about to be released for successful reintegration into society. This program has proven effective in reducing recidivism.   My team was delighted to participate in the Zephyrhills Chamber of Commerce annual Christmas breakfast last week. The Saint Leo Chorus did an outstanding job performing for the group of community leaders.  My team was honored to participate in the Alliance for Substance Addiction Prevention (ASAP)'s annual brunch to celebrate the progress being made in Pasco County. Did you know that over the last year, Pasco moved from having the 5th highest drug overdose death rate in the state of Florida to the 10th? This is largely due to the fact that Pasco first responders are using Narcan more frequently. Narcan helps prevent death in cases of opioid overdose. Last year, Narcan was used 900 times by first responders in Pasco County. We still have work to do in terms of improving access to treatment, but it is important to recognize the collaborative effort of our community partners as they work to combat addiction.   Additionally, my team was pleased to participate in the Hillsborough County Medical Association's annual legislative advocacy luncheon to learn more about the issues impacting the medical community and the needs of patients.

Three Constitutional experts outlined how the President&#8217;s actions match what the framers sought to prevent &#8211; a king or despot who is above the law &#8211; by including the remedy of impeachment in our nation&#8217;s founding document. Speaker Pelosi also instructed&nbsp;House Committee Chairs to begin drafting articles of impeachment based on the overwhelming evidence of this crime and the threat it poses to the security of the 2020 elections and our national defense. As a member of the Intelligence and Oversight committees, I was proud of the comprehensive report prepared by the Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees and transmitted to the Judiciary Committee detailing the findings of our work over the past four months. As Congress drafts articles of impeachment to hold this President accountable, the American people can be confident that despite the President&#8217;s many efforts to obstruct us, we have nevertheless obtained indisputable facts that the President attempted to bribe an ally to produce dirt on a political opponent in exchange for taxpayer-funded security assistance. I urge all of you to read the report&#8217;s summary and decide for yourself if the President&#8217;s conduct is acceptable.&nbsp;This is a solemn time for our country, but we will not shirk our duty to uphold the law and defend our democracy and national security. Throughout this process and this week, my Democratic colleagues and I have continued to introduce, debate, and vote on legislation to protect voting rights, codify insider trading laws, support a two-state solution and end the scourge of robocalls. That&nbsp;includes the introduction of my bill to combat sexual harassment and discrimination in academia, which you can read more about here.  The coming week will be just as busy as the last, so make sure you don&#8217;t miss my next edition of the DC Dashboard.                   As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

According to recent studies, more than half of women who work in academia and between 20-50 percent of women students have experienced sexual harassment. Even more alarming, a 2014 study found that 25 percent of women surveyed had been sexually assaulted while conducting scientific fieldwork. Our universities are hotbeds of innovation and excellence, but too often they fail faculty, staff, and students by choosing to protect themselves or their superstar, grant-earning professors instead of survivors. We cannot accept a system that robs people of the opportunity to reach their full potential and deprives our country of their contributions. My bill would take a critical first step toward promoting accountability and transparency by requiring educational institutions to report findings of discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment, against a principal investigator to all federal agencies that awarded it competitive research and development grants in the past ten years and to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. It would also direct agencies to consider this information when making funding decisions and give them the explicit authority to condition grant awards on the replacement of a harasser.  Voted to Restore Federal Powers to Protect Voting Rights On Friday, the House passed H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, a key plank of the House Democrats&#8217; For the People legislative agenda. Voting rights are the bedrock of our democracy, but the right to vote has been under intense attack. The 14th and 15th Amendments empowered Congress to act to protect the right to vote, and in 1965 Congress and President Johnson took bold and decisive action to enforce the constitutional right to vote with the Voting Rights Act (VRA).  For decades this landmark civil rights law expanded and protected the right to vote for minority communities. But in 2013, the Supreme Court decided that because of the significant progress that had been made the law&#8217;s enforcement mechanism was no longer necessary and struck it out as unconstitutional. Since this decision, there has been a revival of rampant voter suppression engineered by partisan operatives seeking to unfairly tilt elections in their favor. It is now clear that the VRA's enforcement mechanism was essential, and H.R. 4 will restore that for contemporary conditions and add in additional protections for voting rights.  At Long Last, A Robocall Law! On Wednesday, the House passed a hopefully-final bill to combat the scourge of robocalls, the result of negotiations between the House and Senate that should land on the President&#8217;s desk soon and become law. This is a rare legislative accomplishment in these divisive times and as annoying and harassing as robocalls are, we can all agree that something has to be done about them. The final bill imposes technical requirements on telecoms companies to eliminate &#8220;spoofed&#8221; calls that mask the true source of the call with a fake number. It also includes a provision to extend robocall-blocking services on a cost-free basis to consumers&#8212;a variation on a key provision of the ROBOCOP Act that I introduced.  House Passed Resolution Supporting a Two-State Solution On Friday, the House voted to pass H. Res. 326, which affirms Congress&#8217; commitment to and the importance of a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I have long believed that only two states can protect Israeli security while respecting Palestinian rights. This resolution is timely and necessary given the Trump Administration&#8217;s backsliding&#8212;whether by legitimizing settlements or cutting aid to the Palestinian Authority&#8212;and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu&#8217;s proposal to annex parts of the West Bank. Please know that I will continue to fight against dangerous pro-annexation and pro-settlement activities and promote a peaceful two-state solution to the conflict by showing the world that President Trump doesn&#8217;t speak for Congress or the American people on this issue.  Voted to Codify Insider Trading Laws This week, I voted in favor of H.R. 2534, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, which passed the House and now goes to the Senate. It may come as a surprise to many that insider trading is not expressly prohibited by federal statute. Rather, courts and federal regulators have been developing the laws against insider trading based on overarching principles concerning the fiduciary duties that insiders have to a company and its shareholders, as well as the notion that one who steals company secrets shouldn&#8217;t unjustly enrich themselves by trading on those secrets.  The laws vary and recent court decisions have made violations difficult to prove, so congressional action is more important than ever. The House Financial Services Committee created this strong, unambiguous statutory provision to codify and clarify the standards against insider trading. It is now on the Senate to swiftly take up and approve this legislation and for the President to sign it into law.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Signed Holiday Cards to Servicemembers  We cannot forget or take for granted our brave servicemembers deployed here at home and around the world and all that they do to protect and defend our freedoms. I wish them and their loved ones the happiest of holidays.  Chaired Military Personnel Subcommittee Hearing on Military Health Care Reform On Thursday, I chaired a hearing for the House Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee that focused on the Department of Defense&#8217;s consolidation of the military health care systems into one Defense Health Agency. Representatives from the DOD and the services&#8217; Surgeons General testified to the difficulties and challenges of transitioning to a joint, unified system. Within the Subcommittee, members expressed bipartisan support and concern with the DOD&#8217;s lagging reform efforts and subsequent impacts on readiness. With looming cuts to medical personnel and an untested medical system on the horizon, know that I will continue with diligent oversight to ensure that our servicemembers and their families receive the comprehensive medical care that they need and deserve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Spoke on National Democratic Institute Panel on Engaging Male Allies in Gender Equality This week, I spoke at a National Democratic Institute (NDI) event about men as transformative allies in achieving gender equality, specifically within the context of post-conflict or crisis situations globally. The discussion was relevant as the U.S. works to implement the Women, Peace and Security Act, which recognized the strong relationship between women&#8217;s participation in security efforts and more stable and peaceful societies. Research has shown that women&#8217;s participation in resolution processes decreases the chances of peace agreements failing by a whopping 64 percent and increases the chances of peace agreements lasting for fifteen years by 35 percent. Research has also shown, and we know intuitively, that societies with more gender equality are more peaceful and prosperous. It&#8217;s important to engage men in these efforts, because gender equality is in all our best interests. We will not achieve the gender equality we seek until men recognize their responsibility to ensuring complete equality as well.    Meetings with Jackie Joined a Video Conference with Female Afghan Parliamentarians  My colleagues and I reaffirmed our commitment to Afghanistan&#8217;s women and helping make their inclusion in peace talks a reality. Afghan women must have a seat at the negotiating table. After all, research shows that peace deals are more likely to stick when women are involved in such discussions. I will continue to engage with our Afghan women counterparts to ensure they receive the necessary and support and respect that they deserve.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District Each week, hundreds of my constituents reach out to my San Mateo and Washington, D.C. offices to express their concerns and support for issues and get information about legislation and policies. Every constituent who writes in receives a personal response. Here are some issues raised this week:   &#8226; 74 constituents shared their support for H.R. 230, the Ban Toxic Pesticides Act of 2019. This bill, which I am an original cosponsor of, would ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and prohibit any future registration of the pesticide, which can cause nausea, dizziness, and even respiratory paralysis and death in humans.&nbsp; &#8226; 46 constituents reaffirmed their support for scientific integrity. We must take steps to protect federal research from politically-motivated attacks and I will continue to fight any attempts by President Trump to limit public access to information, especially scientific data.

The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants (), the AMIGOS Act (), which includes Portugal in the list of foreign states whose citizens are eligible for admission into the United States as E1 and E2 nonimmigrants if United States citizens are treated similarly by Portugal, a bill that provides that the amount of time that an elderly prisoner must serve before being eligible for placement in home detention is reduced by the amount of good time credits earned by the prisoner (), a resolution supporting the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and its Sixth Replenishment (), the End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act (), a resolution reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements to ensure a lasting peace in Northern Ireland (), a resolution disapproving the Russian Federation's inclusion in future Group of Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors and adheres to the standards of democratic societies (), the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act (), the TRACED Act (), which will combat the illegal robocall epidemic by improving deterrence and enforcement, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act (), a resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding United States efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution (), and the Voting Rights Advancement Act ().  It is not unusual to hear your phone ring and see an unfamiliar number come across the screen. Robocalls have become an aggravating and persistent problem in Arkansas and across the nation. These types of calls are irritating and, many times, the work of scammers looking to defraud or harass innocent families and businesses. I&#8217;m pleased to report that while impeachment has overwhelmingly consumed the House agenda, Congress was able to pass bipartisan legislation to combat this problem. The TRACED Act, which I am a cosponsor of, increases protections for consumers by requiring telephone carriers to verify calls and allows additional capabilities that allow consumers to block calls from scam artists. The bill also gives law enforcement and the FCC the resources needed to track and address robocall scammers. I&#8217;m pleased that this legislation has been passed by both the House and Senate, and I look forward to President Trump swiftly signing it into law. With less than 10 legislative days left on the calendar, bipartisan work that will actually help Americans, like the TRACED Act, should continue to be the priority. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen. While Democrats remain transfixed on removing a duly elected president &#8211; with Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing that she will proceed with filing articles of impeachment &#8211; the majority party continues to hurl us towards a potential government shutdown, is refusing to bring the USMCA to a vote, and has still failed to produce a budget. In this vein, I sent a letter with House Budget Committee Republicans to Chairman John Yarmuth (D-KY) to express disappointment with the Democrat majority&#8217;s focus on a partisan impeachment process that has resulted in failure to make progress on fiscal issues and other Budget Committee responsibilities.  This year has been a tremendous missed opportunity, and it saddens me to see the First Session of the 116th Congress close with no effort to address the dire budget outlook we face. Rather than pursuing zealous partisan investigations and impeachment, House Democrats could have worked to pass a budget resolution -&nbsp; the primary responsibility of this Committee - and advance bipartisan solutions to address our nation&#8217;s rising deficits and debt. We need to get back to the people&#8217;s work. Read the full letter . &nbsp;  MEETINGS  This week, I had the privilege of traveling to the Centers for&nbsp;Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. As you might remember, I recently brought Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the&nbsp;CDC, to the Third District. With this visit, we were able to build on the recent discussions we had in Arkansas to get both a local and national lens on various topics. The&nbsp;CDC&#8217;s mission is to protect America from health, safety, and security threats, both in the U.S and abroad. That means tracking disease challenges, developing public health initiatives, detecting and responding to health threats, supporting medical innovation, and educating the public. The department&#8217;s purview covers a range of things, including everything from the opioid epidemic and HIV challenges to Ebola and vaccines.  Our visit started with a discussion on the CDC&#8217;s mission and its future role in public health, including efforts for data modernization. Technology continues to change our capabilities, and things like data modernization will allow the department to respond faster and more effectively when there are outbreaks, like measles, mumps, or even the flu. We then sat down to talk about rural health in Arkansas and the CDC&#8217;s work with local health departments and the University of Arkansas. These partnerships enable them to closely work with community members to more effectively implement programs focused on creating a healthier Natural State. An example of one of these initiatives includes work with schools to help children make healthy decisions to reduce childhood obesity. Additionally, the CDC and the U of A work together to educate the Marshallese population on issues related to preventing and managing chronic diseases like diabetes.  The CDC also discussed their efforts to reduce drug overdoses from opioids and meth, and their work to prevent people from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place. Unfortunately, while many states are beginning to see their drug epidemic leveling off, Arkansas has actually seen an increase in overdose deaths. The CDC is working directly with Arkansas and has given the state some funding to help stem overdoses. The CDC is tracking opioid, meth, and fentanyl use and deaths and is committed to stopping these fatal overdoses. I then received a briefing on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and learned more about their joint efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) to stop and track the potential spread of this disease. Whether near or far, disease threats can't be overlooked. Past and present examples show how easily infectious diseases can spread across borders, land, and water. We also learned more about how the CDC tracks disease outbreaks from their Emergency Operations Center. These outbreaks are not just things like Ebola and polio, but include domestic issues like Hepatitis A and the flu. Global health security and making sure that deadly diseases are stopped before they spread is an important part of the CDC&#8217;s mission and one that was clearly shown during the visit. I want to extend a special thank you to the CDC, Director Redfield, and all the public health experts for their productive and important discussions on public health work in the Third District and across the U.S. and globe. The CDC is a critical part of our nation&#8217;s well-being and health security. I then headed to Washington for legislative business and meetings. I love having the opportunity to meet and learn about the amazing manufacturing companies that are located in AR-3. It was great to welcome Glatfelter&#8217;s leadership and employees to D.C. to receive an update on the facility. The company, which is located in Fort Smith, produces a range of household products, including things like wet wipes, coffee filters, and food packaging. I&#8217;m proud of our district&#8217;s strong&nbsp;manufacturing sector. My goal is to always keep this opportunity growing and to build our pipeline of skilled workers. The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors of Arkansas also stopped in to discuss the SECURE Act, legislation focused on helping hardworking families to achieve retirement security.  I wrapped up the week by meeting an incredible young woman from Farmington: Britney Thomas. Britney was nominated for a RareVoice Award for going above and beyond to impact policy change for the rare disease community. She has faced many health issues and has persevered no matter the circumstance. Her passion for helping others and advocating for those suffering from rare diseases is notable, and I know she will continue to be a force of change.  Wishing Arkansas&#8217;s Third District a great weekend!

It&#8217;s always wonderful to meet with Laura, sign cards, and talk about her commitment to making the holidays brighter for our service men and women. Laura, keep up the great work &#8211; you make New Hampshire proud! Combating Illegal Robocalls  All Americans know what it&#8217;s like to receive countless robocalls &#8211; often multiple times a day. I was glad to vote in favor of bipartisan legislation &#8211; the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act &#8211; this week to help put the American consumer back in control and reduce the frequency of these incessant, disruptive calls. I&#8217;m pleased the House and Senate came together in a bipartisan way to pass this commonsense and much-needed bill, and I urge the President to swiftly sign it into law. Standing Up for Critical Nutrition Assistance   The Trump Administration&#8217;s announcement that it will end nutrition assistance for approximately 700,000 Americans demonstrates a clear lack of care and concern for people who are struggling to put food on the table. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress rejected these cuts to the SNAP program last year. The Administration&#8217;s rule recklessly casts people from the program without considering what economic, geographic, health, and other factors may contribute to their needing food assistance. I hope that the President will re-think this unnecessary and cruel decision. Getting PFAS Chemicals Out of Cosmetics   It was great to join my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues on Wednesday to hear from administration officials, cosmetic industry professionals, and environmental experts to explore how we can empower the Food and Drug Administration to ensure all cosmetic and personal care products are safe.   Despite our progress in New Hampshire to get PFAS chemicals out of our backyards, PFAS is present in many cosmetic and personal care products. From makeup to shampoo, Americans deserve products free from these harmful chemicals. I look forward to the work ahead to protect communities in the Granite State and across the nation from PFAS.       Speaking out against PFAS chemicals in cosmetics. Watch here.    Ensuring New Hampshire Workers are Treated Fairly  While it&#8217;s encouraging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has heeded my request to return to the bargaining table and have a fair and open discussion with American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union representatives, the EPA should have come to this decision sooner. These union representatives are following in the footsteps of previous generations of union members who fought tirelessly for basic fairness and justice on the job, and they deserve a fair negotiation process.  I&#8217;ll be monitoring this situation in the hopes that an acceptable contract will be agreed upon in a timely manner. I will continue to stand up for the hard-working men and women in New Hampshire and I&#8217;ll keep working to ensure that workers nationwide are treated fairly and with respect. Building a Clean Economy   The Granite State is home to some of our nation&#8217;s most pristine, breathtaking lands, and we must act to protect them for future generations. I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing the 100% Clean Economy Act &#8211; a critical step to combat climate change, improve public health, and strengthen our economy with green jobs. The time to act on climate is now. I look forward to my continued work to protect all that makes New Hampshire such a special place to call home.  A Somber but Necessary Step   This week, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House will begin to draft articles of impeachment. I believe this is a somber but necessary moment for our democracy and to protect our national security. We are taking this one step at a time, and when the House Judiciary Committee advances articles of impeachment, I will evaluate each on its individual merits and content.  The House Intelligence Committee&#8217;s report on the impeachment inquiry uncovered substantial and uncontested evidence that President Trump abused the power of the presidency to solicit foreign interference in our election for his own political gain. Every American should have an opportunity to assess the facts and draw conclusions from the evidence. I encourage you to examine the evidence and reach out to my office with your thoughts.  Giving Back to the Community        At the Friendly Kitchen    It was wonderful to join my husband Brad, members of my staff and local volunteers to serve lunch at The Friendly Kitchen in Concord on Monday- thank you Chef Carl and Val for hosting us! Giving back to others is what the holiday season is all about.   Honoring Bill Luti &#8211; a Granite State Role Model   Like so many Granite Staters, I am looking back fondly on the life of Bill Luti, who passed away last week at the age of 98. Bill coached cross country and track for decades at Concord High School and inspired countless young people to challenge themselves and live up to their potential. He was also a role model for young women, having started Concord High&#8217;s girls&#8217; track and field program in the 1970s, when girls&#8217; participation in sports was not taken as seriously as it is today. My thoughts are with Bill&#8217;s family and friends at this time &#8211; his kind and generous spirit will be long remembered.   Here for You&nbsp;  I encourage you to continue reaching out to me with any questions, concerns or ideas you have &#8211; I love hearing from Granite Staters! You can contact my Concord office at 603-226-1002 or my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206. Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our great state &#8211; I hope you enjoy your weekend!

We intend to move the Lowering Drug Costs Now Act that will allow Medicare to negotiate to lower the costs of prescriptions drugs and carry lower prices over to private insurance, update the Voting Rights Act, finish appropriations bills and consider Articles of Impeachment along with other important items before Christmas. Speaker Pelosi and I started the week leading a delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 to demonstrate that, despite Presidents Trumps announced withdraw from the international Paris Climate Accord, the United States will remain committed to climate action. I am crafting a climate action plan to help transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy to benefit our health, create good-paying jobs and tackle the rising costs of climate change. The time is now America must lead  and in the words of that great Floridian Tom Petty show the world that the U.S. wont back down! Yesterday the Congress passed the bipartisan TRACED Act that will help eliminate robocalls that are not just annoying but are undermining our entire phone system and consumer safety. Last year, our Tampa neighbors suffered through an estimated 450 million robocalls and the scams are becoming more sophisticated every day. The Act requires carriers to offer call-authentication technology to everyone at no additional charge; requires opt-in or opt-out robocall blocking be offered at no additional charge; gives the FCC the ability to step up enforcement actions against unlawful robocalls with a longer statute of limitations and increased fines; pushes DOJ to bring more criminal prosecutions against criminal robocallers. Moffitt Cancer Center helped highlight the problem of robocalls within hospitals and I am pleased that the Act protects patients, doctors and hospitals from unlawful robocalls too. The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and for more than 50 years the Voting Rights Act (VRA) was there to protect everyones access to this basic tenet. Many marched, bled and even died to establish these protections. [KC Selma photo] The U.S. Supreme Courts 2013 decision Shelby v. Holder gutted important protections to the right to vote. Voter suppression campaigns, voter roll purges and insidious barriers to the voting booth, including elimination of preclearance requirements in Florida swept the country. Now the House will restore important, modern protections to the right to vote this week with passage of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act. CDC, NIH and FDA urged everyone over age six to get your flu shot today during my Energy and Commerce Committee hearing entitled \"Flu Season: U.S. Public Health Preparedness and Response. Its shaping up to be a busy flu season here in Tampa, and local hospitals are already seeing multiple strains of influenza in children and adults. Be sure to protect yourself and your family, as I stressed in the hearing. The House also will vote on H.R. 2534 the Insider Trading Prohibition Act to make it easier for the government to prosecute cases against company insiders and outsiders who receive confidential tips. This legislation is a meaningful step towards protecting the hard-earned savings of Americans and cleaning up corruption across the country by holding bad actors accountable. During the holiday season, dont forget to shop small in local businesses that make Tampa so special. Be mindful of families that need a helping hand and the organizations that make that possible like Feeding Tampa Bay that provides groceries to over 600,000 food insecure Floridians. My recent visit was a reminder of the importance of protecting federal food assistance for the most vulnerable among us. While the Trump administration announced the elimination of food assistance to millions of American families this week, I am proud that our community will work together to ensure that children and families dont go hungry.

Scenes from Maine  \"Stuff the Bus\" for Preble Street 2019  We had a great turnout to the \"Stuff the Bus\" event for Preble Street in Portland over Thanksgiving week! A reminder that this season isn&#8217;t just about giving thanks for what you have; it&#8217;s about sharing our blessings with others.     Honoring our Service Members on Veterans Day 2019 This Veterans Day, it was my privilege to honor all the men and women who answered the call to serve in defense of our nation. I traveled across Maine to thank the Maine veterans who sacrificed to ensure our freedoms &#151; they truly represent the best of America. Here are some snapshots of the day:   Great way to begin the day: the Martin&#8217;s Point Veterans Day Breakfast, where I joined Portland community members and healthcare providers to honor the service of Maine veterans, their caregivers, and their families.   The Fisher House on the Togus VA Medical Center campus&nbsp; provides a home for veterans and their families while they seek treatment and recover. Healing can be a long process, and it&#8217;s vital to have your support network close by.  Open Enrollment Event in Portland   On the opening day of the Open Enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), I joined healthcare providers and advocates to urge Maine people to sign up for health insurance for 2020. As you read this, there are less than two weeks left to sign up&nbsp;&#150; there's really no time to waste &#150; get your coverage today! With Less Than Two Weeks Left to Sign-Up, Register for Healthcare Today! Senator King's column appeared in the Times Record&nbsp;and the Mount Desert Islander.  As winter approaches, Maine people are busy preparing for low temperatures, high snowfalls, and a holiday season that seems to grow a little longer each year. With so much to do (and shorter days making it even harder to get it all done), I know how easy it is for something important to slip through the cracks &#150; which is why I&#8217;m writing today to remind you that the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s (ACA) Open Enrollment period is open for approximately 2 more weeks, ending on December 15th. You can sign up by visiting .  In the event of an unexpected illness or injury, insurance can save you from medical or financial ruin. With such a short window to secure critical coverage, there&#8217;s no time to put this off. December 15th will be here before you know it.

I am honored and humbled to represent you in Washington. My family and I wish all of you a Happy Thanksgiving full of family and friends.    This Thanksgiving, I am also thankful for my colleagues&#8217; commitment to fighting the opioid epidemic. Last week, I was happy to join a roundtable hosted by the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force to discuss how we can protect our communities from this public health crisis. It was a great discussion all around! We&#8217;ve accomplished so much since January--and this is just the beginning. Together, we can stop this epidemic once and for all.   I am thankful to be a member of the Education and Labor Committee, which supports Members every day in our efforts to make critical reforms to America&#8217;s schools and workforce. During last week&#8217;s hearing, I had the opportunity to question the Department of Labor about why funds are being taken away from apprenticeships, which are America&#8217;s most successful workforce training program.      OPEN ENROLLMENT  Open Enrollment started on November 1st, and you have until December 15th to sign up for health insurance.

This Congress, however, has been unlike any other I have served. Over the last two months, Congress has been consumed by impeachment.  In some respects, this investigation seems to be politics as usual, as House Democrats have filed articles of impeachment every single year President Trump has been in office. In fact, the October vote on impeachment was the first in American history to take place without a single vote of bipartisan support. Unfortunately, these last few weeks have brought about new methods and standards which will forever impact the way a mechanism like impeachment can be used against a sitting head of state.  The proceedings are in fact historic, but for all the wrong reasons. What&#8217;s more, every moment spent on impeachment is an opportunity lost to address the many issues facing thousands of Minnesotans and millions of Americans.&nbsp;  An unratified United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which will level the playing field for dairy farmers and communities like the ones in Stearns County &#150; waits on Speaker Pelosi's desk as she calculates the House&#8217;s next move against the President. Minnesotans continue to make frequent visits to Canada for affordable medication because Congress cannot dedicate the time it should to address the rising cost of prescription drugs. And hundreds of Minnesota jobs and thousands of dollars in medical research and development remain at risk if the Medical Device Tax and the Health Insurance Tax go into effect at the end of the year.&nbsp;Not to mention a bill to fund the federal government before December 21st&#133; Efforts to undermine a duly elected president are not only detrimental to the fabric of our nation, they take away from Congress&#8217; ability to support the growth and opportunity of every American.  As impeachment drags into yet another month, I remain committed to finding real solutions to some of our nation&#8217;s most pressing issues. I have introduced ten bills and co-sponsored over a hundred more, tackling issues&nbsp;like mental health, sexual assault, mortgage access, medical innovation and transportation.  I'll continue to do the work you've entrusted me with, but I rely on your input, I have hosted over a dozen town halls this year&nbsp;to try to take your priorities to Washington. My next&nbsp;town hall meeting is scheduled for Monday, December 2nd at 7 PM at the Delano City Hall. I hope to see many of you there to build on our productive discussions.&nbsp; If you have any questions, concerns or comments in the meantime, please feel free to call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2331 or my District Office at 763-241-6848.

Even though there has been extensive innovation in health care and improvements in technology, recent reports have shown an increase in the number of women that are dying due to pregnancy complications.&nbsp;The bills we advanced would further address maternal mortality and improve the health outcomes of expectant and new mothers by strengthening America&#8217;s maternal health care workforce and enhancing coverage for pregnant and postpartum women in Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The bills would also help improve rural access to maternal health services, something critical for our district.  The bills, which passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, are now headed to the full House of Representatives. I will continue to work hard on this issue, and I look forward to moving these bills through the House and eventually to the President&#8217;s desk.  Working to Protect Communities from Nuclear Waste  The Energy and Commerce Committee also approved legislation that would finally fulfill the federal commitment to have a safe and permanent nuclear waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2019 would ensure that nuclear waste is stored in Yucca Mountain, which both current law and science designate as the safest place for nuclear waste. Congress first designated Yucca Mountain as the key storage facility in 1978 after scientists found it could safely store nuclear waste for one million years.  Currently, instead of Yucca Mountain, nuclear waste is temporarily housed in facilities located in 121 different communities across the country, one being near the Columbia River at Hanford in Washington. Nuclear energy provides a critical source of affordable, safe, reliable, and emission-free power for our country, and it&#8217;s important that we have a safe storage space for nuclear waste. The bill is now headed to the full House of Representatives.&nbsp;In the last Congress, I helped lead the effort to gain bipartisan House passage of this measure.&nbsp;While we got 340 votes in the House, the Senate ran out of time to take it up. Hopefully, in this Congress, we can finally get the job done and can ensure our communities are protected from nuclear waste.  Protecting Oregon Tourism&nbsp;  Oregon&#8217;s Second District is blessed with many great wonders like Crater Lake, the Painted Hills, Ashland&#8217;s Shakespeare Festival, and&nbsp;the Wallowa Mountains, to name a few. Tourism brings a great source of revenue to every part of our district&nbsp;-- you know there aren&#8217;t a lot of places where you can ski in the morning, windsurf in the afternoon, and end your day with farm-to-table food and local craft beer, kombucha, or wine! Brand USA has helped Travel Oregon get the word out about the many wonders Oregon has to offer.&nbsp;Last week, I helped advance legislation that continues this important, national program which operates at NO COST to the taxpayers. This bill will help entice foreign visitors to Oregon and across the United States, which will boost local economies and provide more jobs. The bill is now headed to the full House of Representatives along with more than a dozen others measures that will help improve Oregon and our country.&nbsp;The other bills help defend against cyber-attacks, expand rural broadband, and provide greater consumer protection. We made a lot of progress last week in the Energy and Commerce Committee and I look forward to continuing that bipartisan work to help improve the lives of Oregonians and Americans.  Commemorating Veterans Day in Central Oregon  I sure enjoyed celebrating Veterans Day in Central Oregon. On the eve of Veterans Day, I was honored to join Central Oregon Marines in celebrating the Marine Corps 244th Birthday at their Marine Corps Ball. I delivered the keynote speech and&nbsp;had the chance to meet with many U.S. Marines and their families.&nbsp;I also spoke with the incredibly inspiring Redmond Marine Corps JROTC.   Greg Walden presents a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Redmond Marine Corps JROTC. On Veterans Day, I enjoyed coffee and conversation with veterans in Bend. Our veterans are truly inspiring and have given so much to this grateful nation. It is important that we give back to them, which is why one of my top priorities in Congress is ensuring that our veterans receive the services and support they deserve. The East Oregonian published my op-ed that details the importance of standing up for our nation&#8217;s veterans and what Congress can do to help. You can read my op-ed here.   Greg Walden enjoying coffee and conversation with veterans in Bend. I also spent time with central Oregon veterans in October. I had the chance to meet with the Redmond Band of Brothers and the Central Oregon Submarine Group. Additionally, I held a roundtable discussion with a wide range of local leaders in La Pine. We discussed all sorts of important topics including forest management, cougar and wolf management and their impacts on the deer and elk populations, and the opioid epidemic and its impact on the local community.  Greg Walden Talks Opioid Epidemic in Southern Oregon  In October, I delivered congratulatory remarks at the Josephine County Drug Court Graduation. At the graduation, I listened to stories from the young men and women who were part of the 69th Josephine County Drug Court graduating class. It was a great reminder that while we are making progress combating the opioid epidemic, more work remains.   Greg Walden delivers congratulatory remarks at the Josephine County Drug Court Graduation. While in southern Oregon, I held a roundtable discussion with La Clinica and Rogue Community Health officials about what more needs to be done to combat the substance use epidemic. The roundtable discussion was another opportunity for me to hear from those on the front lines of the crisis. During the roundtable, we also discussed community health center (CHC) funding and the need to ensure that CHCs are fully funded. CHCs serve more than 240,000 Oregonians in our district. In Washington, D.C., I&#8217;m helping to lead the effort to provide five years of full funding for our community health centers.&nbsp;   Rep. Greg Walden Attends Drug Court Graduation in Josephine County  On Friday, eight more people graduated from the Josephine County drug court, bringing the total number of grads to 416. This drug court started in 1996 and NewsWatch12's Cassidy Delamarter is digging into the impact it's had on the community.  Friday's graduates saved tax payers more than $277,000 dollars by choosing drug court instead of incarceration. The program is voluntary and lasts between 12 and 18 months. The goal is to provide high-risk drug offenders with substance abuse treatment and the support they need to recover. Treatment includes counseling, education and the development of a personal support system. Charges can be dismissed upon successful graduation.  Click here to read more from KDRV.  Bringing $15.5 Million Grant for the City of Medford  Earlier this month the Department of Transportation (DOT) awarded the City of Medford a grant for $15.5 million to help expand the roadway along Foothill Road and North Phoenix Road in east Medford. This grant is great news for southern Oregon and will allow for better flow of traffic and safer conditions for those traveling along Foothill Road, while simultaneously providing jobs and fueling the economy. I worked closely with local officials and made the case directly to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.&nbsp;I&#8217;m very appreciative of her and the Trump Administration&#8217;s support for improving transportation infrastructure in our part of Oregon.   Rep. Walden announces $15.5 million grant for Foothill Road expansion    Representative Greg Walden announced a $15.5 million federal grant for a construction project in Medford.  The city is actively working on a project to address a number of transportation issues. One of those projects is widening Foothill Road and North Phoenix Road by adding additional lanes.

Commemorating the One-Year Anniversary of the&nbsp;SUPPORT Act Becoming Law  Last month we commemorated the one-year anniversary of President Trump signing my bill, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, into law. The legislation, which became law on October 24, 2018, provided the most significant Congressional effort to combat the drug epidemic. Today, we are seeing fewer people die from overdose deaths and more people receiving medical care for their substance use disorder.&#8239;Thanks to this bill, local caregivers and organizations are getting new funds to help provide assistance to those in need all across Oregon and the nation. To commemorate the one-year anniversary, I attended a roundtable discussion on further efforts needed to combat the opioid epidemic. The discussion was hosted by First Lady Melania Trump and attended by many other key officials including the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. I also wrote an op-ed in the Bend Bulletin that highlighted the progress made by the SUPPORT Act and discussed what work remains to be done. You can read my op-ed here.   Ways My Office Can Help&nbsp;  We recently helped a constituent get her DACA application approved. Her son was sick in the hospital and in need of an organ transplant. She is her son&#8217;s only caregiver and needed quick approval to remain in Oregon to take care of him. Our office ensured she was approved in time to stay in Oregon.

Though there is a great deal of noise filling the halls of the Capitol at present, I refuse to be distracted by partisan games. I remain focused on issues that matter most to my constituents, such as: helping our nation&#8217;s heroes, ensuring seniors have access to quality healthcare options, strengthening national security, facilitating financial prosperity and providing individual constituent service. Continue reading this brief update to learn more about my work on your behalf last week.  Advocating for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  The suicide crisis is a multi-faceted national crisis - not a Veteran-specific one - and it is going to take a government and society wide effort to solve it. Since only six of the 20 servicemembers and Veterans per day who are taking their lives are receiving healthcare services at VA, we must empower VA to work through community partners to reach those most in need.   The IMPROVE Act will prevent Veteran suicide by expanding the reach of VA&#8217;s suicide prevention programs and increasing coordination among community resources that serve a wide variety of Veteran needs. This approach has been helpful in reducing homelessness in the Veteran community, and I believe it will be successful in reducing these staggering suicide statistics.&nbsp; In last week&#8217;s VA Committee&#8217;s Legislative hearing we discussed the IMPROVE Act in greater detail. I&#8217;m a proud cosponsor of this legislation, which will leverage community organizations to help in this fight. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my exchange with Secretary Wilkie. &nbsp;  While we took an important step in advancing legislation to help ensure Veterans don't fall through the cracks last week, Veterans in need of immediate care do not need to wait for this bill to pass. If you or a Veteran you know needs assistance, please reach out. You are not alone. Help is available.   Additionally, this&nbsp;article explains that the VA is finally starting to take the matter of sick Veterans who have been exposed to burn pit toxins more seriously. However, much more can be done to help these Veterans in need. Learning from our mistakes in the past, we must get these heroes the care and benefits they deserve. I have filed bipartisan legislation that will do just that, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight.&nbsp; Helping Seniors  I was glad to review the&nbsp;results from the Pinellas Community Foundation and the Area Agency on Aging's study regarding the needs of seniors in our community. The survey&#8217;s findings are consistent with what I regularly hear from my constituents: access to affordable prescription drugs, dental and healthcare services remain a primary concern. I will continue to work on bipartisan solutions to these issues, and look forward to being a part of the working group of state and local stakeholders seeking to meet these needs.&nbsp; Also, open Enrollment for Medicare ends December 7th. Did you know that a record 24.4 million Americans &#150; 40% of the total Medicare population &#150; are expected to choose a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan during this open enrollment period? The percentage of local MA participants is even higher. I will continue to fight to ensure all seniors have access to healthcare choices, because 94% of MA participants report being satisfied with their current plan. If you or a loved one need help deciding which option is right for you, you may want to contact SHINE at 1-800-96-ELDER. SHINE is a non-profit organization funded by the FL Department of Elder Affairs which provides individual and group counseling about the healthcare options available to seniors.   Protecting National Security  Last week, I filed bipartisan legislation to prohibit future deployment of U.S. strategic assets in Turkey. Unfortunately, under the control of President Erdogan, Turkey has proven that it can no longer be trusted as a reliable ally of the United States. Deploying strategic assets to Turkey no longer makes sense. Click here to learn more.&nbsp; Facilitating Financial Success  Improved consumer confidence is an important indicator of economic strength.&nbsp; New&nbsp;reports show that the majority of Americans believe the economy is doing well and that we are on the right track. I want to make sure that we continue to implement pro-growth policies that benefit all Americans.&nbsp;  Another important component of our continued financial prosperity involves boosting tourism. Last week, my BRAND USA reauthorization bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Brand USA has a proven track record of increasing international tourism to the United States without using any tax dollars. Since tourism is such an important part of our state&#8217;s economy, I want to be sure that this successful program continues. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and help get the bill across the finish line.   Raising Awareness  November is Diabetes Awareness Month. According to the CDC, at least 30 million children and adults in the United States have diabetes. If left untreated, this chronic condition can cause significant medical complications and increases in healthcare costs. Learn more today about how you can recognize the signs and prevent diabetes.   Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following thank you note from a constituent who owns a business in my Congressional district but lives in another country. He had called my office to seek assistance obtaining a visa.  &#8220;One is never sure on the outcome and the duration of these activities until you get the passport back; and we just received both passports back with a 5 year multiple entry visa. I truly wanted to thank Congressman Gus Bilirakis for his effort and support in this, I am sure the outcome would have been different without his strong push/recommendation.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team enjoyed the Grand Opening of Monticciolo Dentistry in Land O' Lakes last week. Welcome to Central Pasco!   My team was honored to participate in last week's Topping Out Ceremony at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH). During this ceremony, the last steel beam was placed on the bed tower project. This marks the culmination of my decade long battle to secure state-of-the-art, private rooms for Veterans in Pasco and Hillsborough county who receive their care at this hospital. In total, the 245,000 square feet of new construction and 5,000 square feet of renovated space will add 96 medical surgical single patient rooms and 40 intensive care unit beds. Given that JAHVH was first constructed in 1971, Veterans have often communicated their desire to receive treatment in a facility that was better equipped to manage the changes that have occurred in the delivery of medicine in the past 50 years, such as greater privacy. It has been a long and arduous process to get to this point, but I would not quit, and the results are going to be worth the effort. Our Veterans deserve the dignity that these private facilities will offer. I have always said that they should have access to the highest quality care in the very best facilities, and today we are one step closer to making that a reality.   My team was also able to participate in the Grand Opening of the Thermo Fisher Scientific Rapid DNA Center of Excellence at the FIU National Forensic Science Technology Center in Pinellas County. For crime labs, law enforcement, and first responders seeking technology, training, and expertise in advanced DNA analysis, the new Center of Excellence is a resource with state-of-the-art testing and training laboratories. It will develop validation guidelines, training modules, and support materials for stakeholders.     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update. I'd like to wish each of you and your families a very Happy Thanksgiving.&nbsp; I hope you are able to relax and enjoy quality time with your loved ones.&nbsp; Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Q&amp;A: Protecting Young Athletes from Abuse Q. What recent federal law was enacted to protect young athletes from abuse? Q. Why did you introduce additional legislation called the SAFESPORT Act?   Quick Links After hearing consistent feedback from Iowans about the insufficient supply of liquid propane gas in the state Senator Ernst and I sent a letter&nbsp;urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to consider ways to prioritize pipeline shipments of propane to Iowa. I&#8217;ve heard from farmers, propane marketers, co-ops and manufacturers in Iowa about how the lack of access to propane is affecting operations and threatening their livelihoods.&nbsp;This week, in response to our letter and calls from several other lawmakers, including Governor Reynolds, FERC announced that it will begin a process to address this shortage.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll continue to work with my colleagues and coordinate with state officials to keep a close watch as this process moves forward.  November is National Adoption Month. This is a time to reflect on what's working in the foster care system and what more needs to be done. In 2018, the average length of stay in foster care increased to over 19 months. Less than half of the kids who exited foster care were reunited with their parents. All children deserve a permanent home, and caring, consistent adults to nurture and guide them. As long as I serve in Congress, I will continue to work toward this goal. Watch my floor speech here.  I&nbsp;introduced bipartisan legislation to crack down on synthetic variations of performance enhancing drugs illegally marketed as dietary supplements. These&nbsp;synthetic drugs, known as SARMs, are designed to mimic controlled substances like steroids and have not been approved by the&nbsp;Food and Drug Administration for human use.&nbsp;The SARMs Control Act of 2019&nbsp;extends the Drug Enforcement Administration&#8217;s (DEA) authority to regulate anabolic steroids to include SARMs. Consumers deserve to know any risks associated with these substances, and the correct scheduling coupled with further DEA oversight will ensure that.

You can find links to the witnesses&#8217; opening statements and video from the hearings below:  Tuesday, November 19th   9:00 a.m. ET &#150; Witnesses: Ms. Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor for Europe and Russia, Office of the Vice President (Opening Statement); Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, Director for European Affairs, National Security Council (Opening Statement)   2:30 p.m. ET &#150; Witnesses: Ambassador Kurt Volker, former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine (Opening Statement); Mr. Timothy Morrison, Special Assistant and Senior Director for Europe and Russia, National Security Council (Opening Statement)  Wednesday, November 20th   9:00 a.m. ET &#150; Witness: Ambassador Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union (Opening Statement)   2:30 p.m. ET &#150; Witnesses: Ms. Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs, Department of Defense (Opening Statement); Mr. David Hale, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Department of State (did not deliver a prepared opening statement)  Thursday, November 21st   9:00 a.m. ET &#150; Witnesses: Dr. Fiona Hill, former Senior Director for Europe and Russia, National Security Council (Opening Statement); Mr. David A. Holmes, Political Counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine (Opening Statement)  Energy and Commerce Committee Passed 18 Bills   The full Energy and Commerce Committee passed 18 bills. Three of the bills originated in my Health Subcommittee and they address two critically important health challenges: the high maternal mortality rate in the U.S., which is the most dangerous place to give birth in the developed world. More than 700 American women die and 50,000 women are severely injured due to complications related to childbirth every year. The second health crisis is the use of e-cigarette vaping among young people. This is threatening to ensnare an entire generation of young Americans to nicotine addiction. The three bills my Subcommittee and the full Committee passed:  The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act which extends tobacco marketing, sale, and flavor restrictions and fees to e-cigarettes, and also makes the landmark change of raising the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21 years.   The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act which funds and authorizes data-driven approaches to inform health care professionals about the best practices and protocols to manage a mother&#8217;s care in an emergency and improves the quality of care that rural moms receive. The CDC estimates that as much as 60% of the deaths from childbirth could be prevented. Black women in the U.S. face even greater dangers because they are three times more likely to die from childbirth than white women.   The Helping Medicaid Offer Maternity Services (MOMS) Act gives states the option to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage from two months to one year. Today, new mothers are thrown off Medicaid two months postpartum.  The Committee also passed key consumer protections from my TRUE Fees Act and my amendment to protect consumer data privacy. Under my TRUE Fees provisions, cable and satellite TV providers will be required to disclose an all-in price to consumers, including fees and taxes, before consumers sign up for a service. It will help cut down on cable companies unfairly swindling billions of dollars from customers by charging hidden fees.  My amendment to the Broadband DATA Act ensures that any personal data collected by FCC contractors is protected. The FCC is currently building a map detailing broadband accessibility in the United States. Under my amendment, FCC contractors working on the project are prohibited from selling the data they collect that belongs to the American people. The Committee also passed the SAFER Pipelines Act, which updates federal standards for natural gas pipelines to ensure they&#8217;re safe and secure. The bill builds on the progress we&#8217;ve made in the nine years since a PG&amp;E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people. I&#8217;m pleased the bill includes language I authored with Congresswoman Jackie Speier to allow cities and private citizens to sue the federal agency that regulates pipelines if it fails to enforce these safety standards.  I look forward to the legislation being passed by the full House. You can learn more about the legislation and watch my opening statement from the markup here. Voted YES on a Continuing Resolution to Fund the Government   The House passed a month-long resolution on Tuesday to fund the government until December 20th. The resolution holds current funding levels in place and was passed to provide Congressional leadership more time to negotiate long-term funding. I&#8217;m committed to keeping the government open and passing a responsible funding plan that ensures a thorough Census and a 3.1% pay raise for our men and women in uniform.  Voted YES on The Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act of 2019  More than 20,000 youth in the United States age out of foster care each year. The Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act creates a pathway for kids aging out of the foster care system to transition successfully into independent living. The bill improves upon existing law by better aligning federal housing assistance resources to reach foster kids aging out of foster care.  Voted YES on The North American Wetlands Conservation Extension Act  Congress passed the North American Wetlands Conservation Act in 1989 to provide federal funding for projects that conserve North America&#8217;s waterfowl, fish, and wildlife resources. The Bay has benefited from this program by protecting the wildlife and wetlands in our District. Congress passed an extension to continue the funding of this vital program until 2024.  Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  Resolution Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Internet  As Co-Chairs of the Congressional Internet Caucus, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) and I introduced a resolution to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Internet and commemorate the first digital data transmission on the ARPANET from UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute. For the past 50 years the Internet has continually revolutionized how Americans live, learn, work, and connect with one another. American ingenuity led to the Internet and the federal government played a key role in its development. I&#8217;m especially proud of the pivotal role that the Stanford Research Institute in our District played in the Internet&#8217;s foundation, receiving the first digital data transmission on the ARPANET, a pioneering predecessor to the modern Internet. The resolution honors the contributions of researchers, universities, government agencies, nonprofits, and private companies in the development of the Internet. To read the resolution, click here, and to learn more about the Congressional Internet Caucus, click here.  Coastal Resilience Research and Education Act  I co-sponsored a bipartisan bill with Rep. Jimmy Panetta to allow the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish National Centers of Excellence at coastal universities and colleges. The designation of Centers of Excellence will be awarded to schools that exhibit national leadership in research and education focused on climate and coastal adaptation and mitigation. The legislation also formalizes collaboration and partnerships between Centers of Excellence and federal agencies, ensuring science-based research, information, and policy recommendations are effectively shared with the federal government.  Weekly Highlights   This week Stanford student-athletes came to Washington, D.C. It was a special privilege to welcome the Men&#8217;s Golf Team, the Men&#8217;s Gymnastic Team, the Women&#8217;s Volleyball Team, and the Women&#8217;s Water Polo Team&#151;all collegiate national championship teams&#151;and congratulate them on their extraordinary achievements.  Turn Cancer Upside Down Award    It was an honor to receive the Turn Cancer Upside Down Award from the Scott Hamilton Cancer Alliance for Research Education and Survivorship (CARES) Foundation for my work to increase funding and research towards cancer treatment. Thank you to everyone at CARES for this honor and for your advocacy on behalf of patients and their families.  In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. So far this year, over 110,000 constituents have contacted me, and this month, 6,542 constituents have weighed in. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments. This week, 2,618 constituents contacted our office, including:   128 constituents wrote to me in support of the&nbsp;TRUE Fees Act   81 constituents wrote to me in support of legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs   68 constituents wrote to me in opposition of the President sending troops to Syria  Anna&#8217;s Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from.&nbsp;  San Jose Mercury News Op-Ed (11/19/2019) &#150; &#8220;Gettysburg Address&#8217; stirring call still relevant, 156 years later&#8221;  On the 156th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, Professor Hasan Zillur Rahim contrasts President Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s words with those of our current President.

This bill, named after Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter who were killed at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, would help local school districts access federal school safety resources by creating a federal clearinghouse of best practices and federal assistance. As administrators, students, parents, and local law enforcement collaborate to make schools across our country safer, it is important that they have easy access to the most accurate and up-to-date information on how best to do so. The Luke and Alex School Safety Act would centralize the latest school safety research, best practices, and grant opportunities, and make them accessible to every school district across America.

I&#8217;m pleased to report they are doing great! I am so proud of everything they have accomplished, and I thank them for being excellent representatives of our Northeast Florida community. I also had the opportunity to congratulate Episcopal School graduate Chandler Washburn and the entire Navy Mixed Crew Team on their recent King&#8217;s Cup Championship!

With more crimes involving digital technology, many law enforcement agencies lack the tools they need to collect digital evidence. That's why I&#8217;m proud to join my friend and fellow former law enforcement officer, Rep. Val Demings, to introduce the bipartisan&nbsp;Technology in Criminal Justice Act of 2019, which will make sure that law enforcement officers have the capability and resources they need to collect, store, and analyze the evidence of today and the future.

Since taking office, he's been working every day to address real issues that help families across the nation, like supporting our military and veterans, lowering the cost of healthcare, securing the border, and&nbsp;reigning-in excessive government spending.&nbsp;  See more on what Senator Scott has been up to on Spectrum News 13's \"Day in the Life\" special below.

Mike Gallagher and colleagues introduced the House companion to Senator Rick Scott&#8217;s bipartisan&nbsp;American Security Drone Act of 2019&nbsp;in the House of Representatives. The American Security Drone Act prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We have to get serious about the national security threat we face from Communist China, who is STEALING our technology and intellectual property. Yet, the U.S. Government continues to buy critical technology, like drones, from Chinese companies backed by their Communist government. We cannot allow this, and Congress should immediately pass the American Security Drone Act.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from&nbsp;Representative Gallagher&#8217;s office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s Support of President Xi Puts Profits Over Human Rights&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after Michael Bloomberg ignored Senator Scott&#8217;s request to change the location of the New Economy Forum, which was&nbsp;set to take place in Communist China this week.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;President Xi continues to violate human rights and go back on every commitment he has made to the United States. How can someone who is running for President think it is acceptable to host a large scale event in Communist China? As Michael Bloomberg makes his case to the American people, he will have to answer for his support of a Communist government and his decision to put profits over human rights.&#8221; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Chris Van Hollen Urge NASEM to Study Role of NIH in Drug Development and Patient Access  Senators Rick Scott and Chris Van Hollen wrote a letter to the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) asking them to&nbsp;issue a report on its recent workshop examining&nbsp;the role of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the development of new drug treatments and&nbsp;its&nbsp;impact on patients. The Senators have introduced the&nbsp;We PAID Act, which would ensure that the prices of drugs developed using federally funded research are set at reasonable levels.

Rick Scott Statement on U.S. Senate Confirmation of Robert Luck  Senator Rick Scott released the statement below following the U.S. Senate&#8217;s confirmation of Robert J. Luck, of Florida, to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud the Senate voted to confirm Justice Robert Luck to serve on the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Luck is a native Floridian who has dedicated himself to a career in public service. As Governor, I had the distinct pleasure to appoint Justice Luck to the bench twice &#150; first to the Miami-Dade circuit court in 2013, and later to Florida&#8217;s Third District Court of Appeal in 2017. I&#8217;m confident Justice Luck will continue to serve our state and nation well, and I am honored to support his confirmation to the federal bench.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Passage of Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act  Senator Rick Scott spoke on the floor in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which will give the United States more authority to re-evaluate Beijing&#8217;s influence on Hong Kong. Senator Scott is a proud co-sponsor of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and won&#8217;t stop fighting until America&#8217;s economic and political future &#151; and the freedom of nations across the globe &#151; is secure from the threat of Chinese influence.

Rick Scott Statement on U.S. Senate Confirmation of Barbara Lagoa  Senator Rick Scott released the statement below following the U.S. Senate&#8217;s confirmation of Barbara Lagoa, of Florida, to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad the Senate voted today to confirm Justice Barbara Lagoa to serve on the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Lagoa has a long history of honorably serving our state. She was appointed to Florida&#8217;s Third District Court of Appeal in 2006, and to the Florida Supreme Court last year, as the first Cuban American woman to serve on that court. I look forward to Justice Lagoa&#8217;s continued service to the people of Florida and am confident she will honorably and faithfully serve the Eleventh Circuit for many years to come.&#8221;  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Tom Cotton and Colleagues Request Suspension of Licenses Allowing U.S. Exports to Huawei  Senators Rick Scott, Tom Cotton and colleagues sent a letter to the President expressing deep concern that the U.S. Department of Commerce has begun issuing export licenses to U.S. firms looking to resume business with Huawei Technologies, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China. In the letter, the Senators requested that the President take immediate action to suspend these approvals to protect national security.&nbsp; Read more, including the full letter, from Senator Tom Cotton&#8217;s office HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott&#8217;s Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act Introduced in the House  This week, Congressman Dave Joyce introduced the companion bill to Senator Rick Scott&#8217;s Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act in the House of Representatives. The&nbsp;Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act&nbsp;will create&nbsp;a consumer-friendly database of prescription drug prices, which will empower American families to make informed healthcare choices.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason patients shouldn&#8217;t know exactly what their prescription drugs cost before they get to the pharmacy. The&nbsp;Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act&nbsp;gives patients the information they need to make informed decisions for themselves and their families. Even in the hyper-partisan, dysfunctional world of Washington, D.C., creating more transparency in the healthcare system is something we must get done now to help families across our nation.&#8221;&nbsp;  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to President Trump: Protect American Taxpayers&#8217; Retirement Funds from Communist China  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio sent a letter to President Trump asking him to replace members of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) after their reckless decision to shift billions of dollars from the Thrift Savings Plan retirement fund to an index fund that includes Chinese companies. Senators Scott and Rubio introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, which would prevent the FRTIB from steering federal retirement savings to Communist China.

I also pointed to significant legislative accomplishments made by the House that are stalled in the Senate; voted to send a bill decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level to the House floor; introduced a bill addressing exorbitant aviation fees; called attention to the deadline for signing up for Affordable Care Act health insurance; announced grants to Memphis International Airport and to two Memphis financial institutions; shared information about federal resources available for childcare assistance; offered U.S. Capitol Historical calendars for 2020; and offered a health tip about avoiding catching a cold.

Applauding&nbsp;Decision to Dispense&nbsp;Surplus&nbsp;TANF Funds&nbsp; Highlighting Accomplishments of the &#8220;For the People&#8221; Agenda&nbsp; Advancing Bill Decriminalizing Marijuana&nbsp; Introducing FAIR Fees Act&nbsp; Calling Attention to Open Enrollment for Affordable Care Act Health Coverage&nbsp;&nbsp; Announcing $6 Million Grant to Memphis International Airport&nbsp; Announcing Grants to Memphis Community Development Financial Institutions&nbsp; Offering 2020 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars&nbsp;&nbsp; Weekly Health Tip&nbsp; Quote of the Week&nbsp;&nbsp;   Applauding State Decision to Dispense&nbsp;Surplus&nbsp;TANF Funds&nbsp;  &nbsp;On Tuesday, I learned that the Tennessee Department of Human Services plans to use $390 million of $732 million in Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) funding withheld for a &#8220;rainy day.&#8221; Earlier this month I wrote a letter to Governor Bill Lee demanding answers as to why this money had not been used. I had been seeking explanations from Governor Bill Lee, with whom I met last week, about the situation and believe Tuesday&#8217;s decision was a small step in the right direction. I remain disappointed that the state&nbsp;will continue to&nbsp;hold a significant amount of this money in reserve, and reminded Governor Lee that every day is a rainy day for those struggling to make ends meet. See my release and my letter to Governor Lee here.&nbsp; Highlighting Accomplishments of the &#8220;For the People&#8221; Agenda&nbsp;  Recently,&nbsp;I have heard conservative politicians and pundits falsely claim that the impeachment inquiry has prevented the House from passing legislation. Nothing could be further from the truth. The House has passed nearly 400 bills this year. Over 300 of those -- including 275 bipartisan bills -- are stuck in the Senate where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to call them up for a vote. This includes the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and bills to protect people with pre-existing conditions and to lower prescription drug costs. As we are so often reminded these days: the truth matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Advancing Bill Decriminalizing Marijuana&nbsp;    On Wednesday, as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I voted to advance the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to the House floor. The bill would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, permit those with non-violent marijuana convictions to have their records expunged and&nbsp;fund restorative justice programs in&nbsp;communities of color disproportionately affected by&nbsp;the&nbsp;misguided &#8220;War on Drugs.&#8221; See my release here.&nbsp;Reforming our marijuana laws has been one of my policy priorities for decades and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the MORE Act.&nbsp; Introducing FAIR Fees Act&nbsp;  Many of my constituents tell me they are regularly frustrated to learn of exorbitant baggage, cancellation and changing&nbsp;reservation fees tacked on to their airfare for basic aviation services. That&#8217;s why I joined my colleagues, Congressman Jesus &#8220;Chuy&#8221; Garcia of Illinois and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, in introducing the Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous (FAIR) Fees Act, which would&nbsp; assure that the fees charged are proportional to the cost of the services provided and protect consumers from abusive pricing practices. See my release here.&nbsp; Calling Attention to Open Enrollment for Affordable Care Act Health Coverage&nbsp;&nbsp;  Open Enrollment for 2020 Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance coverage began on November 1 and ends December 15, which is closer than you might think. The Trump Administration reduced the open enrollment period by six weeks after taking office and is keeping that limited window of opportunity again this year. I have scheduled a &#8220;Congress On Your Corner&#8221; today between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. at the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar Avenue, so that my District Office staff and an ACA navigator can help with the process, as well as with questions about other federal agencies and programs. I have also sent letters,&nbsp;emails and newsletter notifications&nbsp;to my constituents to remind you of the deadline.&nbsp; Meeting with Federal Aviation Administration Officials&nbsp;    On Thursday,&nbsp;I had what I hope was a productive meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration Administration&#8217;s Deputy Administrator, Daniel Elwell, and Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation Chairman Rick Larsen of Washington state,&nbsp;to talk about the lethargic pace at which my Seat Egress in Air Travel (SEAT) Act is being implemented. I serve on the Aviation Subcommittee and made clear to Elwell that the flying public wants to know about how the SEAT Act provisions that became law a year ago are being used to assess the safety of seat sizes and the distances between seats on commercial airliners. I reminded Elwell that his agency regulates the airline industry, not the other way around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Announcing $6 Million Grant to Memphis International Airport&nbsp;   Earlier today, I announced a $6 million grant to Memphis International Airport for a consolidated de-icing facility.&nbsp;The&nbsp;first phase of construction is currently under way, and&nbsp;the next phase of the project, consisting of 12 de-icing pads and related facilities, is expected to begin early next year and&nbsp;to&nbsp;be completed&nbsp;in 2022. This is a significant investment in the airport and will not only make travel through Memphis more efficient but will also provide good jobs. See my release here.&nbsp; Announcing Grants to Memphis Community Development Financial Institutions&nbsp;  On Wednesday, I announced that two Memphis community development financial institutions will be receiving grants from the U.S. Treasury Department totaling $500,000. Tri-State Bank of Memphis will receive $275,000 and River City Capital Investment Corporation will receive $225,000. See my release here.&nbsp; Federal&nbsp;Resources&nbsp;Available for Childcare Assistance&nbsp;    As your Congressman,&nbsp;one of my top priorities is to ensure that Memphians who work tirelessly to provide a strong foundation for their children have the support they need to be successful.&nbsp;Regardless of whether you are a working parent or a student yourself, it is important to know that the state of Tennessee has resources available for child care assistance.&nbsp; Eligible parents and guardians may receive support for child care services through Tennessee&#8217;s Smart Steps Child Care Payment Assistance Program.&nbsp; Visit here to see if you are eligible.&nbsp; Offering 2020 U.S. Historical Society Calendars&nbsp;&nbsp;    My office will have a limited number of 2020 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a calendar, please complete&nbsp; on my website. Due to the rules of the House, I am only able to mail calendars to residents of Tennessee&#8217;s Ninth District.

And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children&#8217;s future. And we are all mortal.&#8221; &#150; The June 10, 1963 American University Commencement Address by President John F.

I&#8217;d like to thank all of the teachers, parents, and support professionals, who are making a difference in the lives of our students each and every day.&nbsp;  One of my top priorities in Congress is education. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I&#8217;m fighting so that all students have access to a quality education. Just a few weeks ago, the Committee passed the College Affordability Act. This critical legislation includes my Higher Education Mental Health Act, which addresses the growing mental health crisis on our college campuses. I also recently joined a bipartisan roundtable run by the Education and Labor Committee to discuss how we can best support registered apprenticeships--America&#8217;s most successful workforce training program.    I believe that, in order to make our education system even better, we have to go straight to the source: our students. Just last week, I met with Walter Johnson High School&#8217;s Youth &amp; Government Club to get students&#8217; perspectives on some of the most pressing issues or country is facing today. It was great hearing their feedback and bright ideas about how to make change. This weekend, I also had the pleasure of attending BroadFutures&#8217; 6th Annual Fall Gala, where I was honored with the Champion Award. It is incredibly important that we create diverse, inclusive workspaces and I will continue to do so in my office.    At last week&#8217;s Freshmen Working Group on Addiction meeting, we gathered lawmakers and experts to discuss how we can best support our veterans with substance use disorder. I came away with a lot of great ideas, including ways we can make the VA more accessible to our veterans. We need to keep having these conversations to help raise awareness and end the stigma of substance use disorder.   I am committed to fostering economic growth in our country and ensuring that all Americans make livable wages. That&#8217;s why last week, I questioned Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell on the stagnating wages for American workers. The bottom line is clear: our workers deserve better.   OPEN ENROLLMENT  Open Enrollment started on November 1st, and we have until December 15th to sign up for health insurance. Plans are available at affordable rates, and many folks are eligible for tax credits that can help offset the cost of premiums. If you&#8217;re not covered yet, now is the time. If you are, make sure all your friends and family get the coverage they need. Americans deserve access to quality, affordable health care.&nbsp;     GET COVERED      COVER PHOTO CONTEST  Just like my email updates, I use social media to update you on what&#8217;s going on in Washington and Maryland. But my Facebook and Twitter cover photos could use an update. That&#8217;s why I need your help. If you have great photos of Maryland&#8217;s Sixth District, I hope you will join the Social Media Photo Contest. Your picture could be our new cover photo!     LEARN MORE    Contest participants must be residents of Maryland&#8217;s Sixth Congressional District. You have until Thursday, December 5th, at 5 PM EST to enter. After submitting your photos, my staff and I will select the finalists. I look forward to seeing your great photos!

(IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS AND THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION ACT OF 2019 Hello Friends, As I'm sure you are aware, this is a week, unfortunately, that will be written about in American history books for generations to come. This week, the United States House of Representatives opened public hearings as we uphold the solemn responsibility of investigating whether the President of the United States abused the powers enumerated unto the him by the constitution, and whether or not those offense rise to the level of impeachment. The misconduct alleged--that the President bribed and extorted a foreign government into interfering in our presidential election--is of the utmost seriousness for any democracy, and I can assure you I am watching the testimony with the thoughtful deliberation that such a moment deserves. I'm hopeful that, as a United States citizen with a say in this outcome, you will give these hearings the attention they deserve and will voice your opinion following the conclusion of testimony from all witnesses, many of which are nonpartisan career public servants. While I know the impeachment hearings have been a focus of the media, the work of Congress on behalf of the American people has not stopped. I'm proud to let you know that a bill I introduced, the Stop Debt Collection Abuse Act of 2019, was passed unanimously out of the Financial Services Committee this week. This legislation would protect American consumers from predatory debt collection practices by closing federal loopholes and bolstering protections for consumers. As it currently stands, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) makes it illegal for debt collectors to use abusive, unfair, or deceptive practices when collecting debts from consumers. Unfortunately for American consumers, a major exception in the FDCPA are debt collectors hired by state or federal government entities. One man in Kansas ended up in jail three times because he was unable to pay the growing debt from an unpaid speeding ticket. People in my home state of Missouri have been thrown in jail because they were not able to pay for traffic violations and other minor offenses. I don't believe the federal government should be held to a different standard when it comes to preying on consumers, and this legislation will close that loophole, ensuring Americans and their credit are better protected. The bill's unanimous passage out of committee is a significant step in the legislative process, and a rare sight in such politically divided times. I'm hopeful the Stop Debt Collection Abuse Act will be taken up for a vote on the House floor in the coming weeks, and that it will be able to garner the same kind of bipartisan support from the whole House. Until it does, I will continue my fight to protect Americans from predatory debt collectors.

I was&nbsp;skeptical at the&nbsp;time and&nbsp;was,&nbsp;unfortunately,&nbsp;proven right when&nbsp;neither promise was kept. So when Anderson, now CEO of Amtrak, came before the Transportation and Infrastructure&nbsp;Committee Wednesday, I told him frankly that I doubted his commitment to customer service and disagreed with his decision to do away with Amtrak&#8217;s traditional dining service.

This week the American people had the opportunity to listen to Mr. George P. Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy; Ambassador William B. Taylor, the acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine; and Ambassador Yovanovitch. You can read the opening statements of Mr. Kent (here), Ambassador Taylor (here), and Ambassador Yovanovitch (here) and watch footage of the hearings here. I&#8217;ve also organized a timeline of the impeachment investigation on my website. As the House proceeds with its investigation to uncover the truth, I continue to uphold my duty to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Health Subcommittee Markup on Maternal Mortality, the Youth Tobacco Epidemic, and Drug Pricing  The Health Subcommittee I chair passed four bills to address public health crises, namely the high maternal mortality rate and the youth tobacco epidemic. Each year, 700 American women die and 50,000 women are severely injured due to complications related to childbirth. And e-cigarette vaping among young people is threatening to ensnare an entire generation of young Americans in nicotine addiction. The four bills my Subcommittee marked up and passed:   The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act extends restrictions on tobacco marketing, sale, flavors, and fees to e-cigarettes. It also makes a landmark change by raising the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21 years.   The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act funds and authorizes data-driven approaches to inform health care professionals about the best practices and protocols to manage a mother&#8217;s care in an emergency, and improves the quality of care that rural moms receive. 700 American women die due to complications related to childbirth every year, but the CDC estimates as much as 60% of these deaths could be prevented. If you&#8217;re a black woman in the U.S., it is even more dangerous to give birth. Black women are three times more likely to die from childbirth than white women. This legislation will ensure every mom is given the care she deserves.   The Helping Medicaid Offer Maternity Services (MOMS) Act gives states the option to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage from two months to one year, protecting mothers in America who lack health insurance during the critical postpartum period.   The STOP GAMES Act clarifies the FDA&#8217;s authority to restrict pharmaceutical companies from using bad-faith, anticompetitive tactics to prevent cheaper generic drugs from coming to the market.  I look forward to the legislation advancing to the full Committee and then passing the House. You can watch my opening statement here.&nbsp; Passed the TRUE Fees Act out of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee  The Communications and Technology Subcommittee passed my legislation, the Truth-In-Billing, Remedies, and User Empowerment over Fees (&#8216;TRUE Fees&#8217;) Act, which requires phone, cable, and internet providers to include all fees and charges in the prices they advertise for services. Consumer Reports estimates cable companies pocket an estimated $28 billion dollars a year by advertising one price to customers, but adding other charges to their bills. On average, they generate close to $450 per year per customer from company-imposed fees, excluding federal, state, and local taxes. My bill requires phone, cable, and internet providers to include fees, charges, and surcharges in the prices they advertise for service; allows customers to end their contract without early termination fees if their provider increases prices; and prevents hikes on equipment fees unless providers improve equipment. I&#8217;m happy for consumers that the TRUE Fees Act was passed by the Subcommittee and that the bill will now move to the full Committee and the full House.  Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Online Privacy Act  On November 5, 2019, Rep. Zoe Lofgren and I introduced the Online Privacy Act. It is bold and comprehensive legislation to secure the privacy of every American. Today, the American people are left vulnerable as our private information is stolen, abused, breached, and grossly mishandled. Companies track and sell our most private data, such as our geolocation and the contents of our messages, and they face little or no consequences when they misuse our information.  Our legislation empowers Americans to control their own data and holds companies accountable.   Creating User Rights &#150; The bill grants every American the right to access, correct, or delete their data. It also creates new rights, like the right to impermanence, which lets users decide how long companies can keep their data.   Placing Clear Obligations on Companies &#150; The bill minimizes the amount of data companies collect, process, disclose, and maintain, and bars companies from using data in discriminatory ways. Additionally, companies must receive consent from users in plain, simple language.   Establishing a Digital Privacy Agency (DPA) &#150; The bill establishes an independent agency led by a Director that&#8217;s appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. The DPA will enforce privacy protections and investigate abuses.   Strengthening Enforcement &#150; The bill empowers state attorneys general to enforce violations of the bill and allows individuals to appoint nonprofits to represent them in private class action lawsuits.  Together with Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, I have worked for months to write comprehensive legislation, which is 132 pages long and has 58 sections. We consulted with over 100 stakeholders, including privacy advocates, public interest groups, academics, companies, and startups. We received nearly 600 pages of written feedback from these stakeholders which helped shape the bill as introduced. Our bill received strong support from public interest organizations and privacy experts. You can read their endorsements here.  Five Bills to Address Excessive Airplane Noise   My Bay Area colleagues and I introduced five bills to mitigate the scourge of airplane noise that has had serious impacts on our community. The legislation provides new methods to mitigate airport noise, prioritize health impacts of noise, and improve community engagement. The five bills are:   Restore Everyone&#8217;s Sleep Tonight (REST) Act: Allows airports to voluntarily impose a curfew, under specified circumstances, at any time between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.   All Participating in Process Reaching Informed Solutions for Everyone (APPRISE) Act: Ensures that community knowledge and input is represented in the FAA flight procedure design process. An aviation roundtable technical representative will be allowed to fully participate in the FAA procedure design process for procedures affecting their communities.   Fairness in Airspace Includes Residents (F-AIR) Act: Amends the FAA&#8217;s prioritization of U.S. airspace use. Safety in managing U.S. airspace would remain the first priority. Secondary priorities would put noise and health impacts to residents and other environmental concerns on an equal basis with efficiency.   Responsive Employees Support Productive Educated Congressional Talk (RESPECT) Act: Requires FAA staff to answer questions submitted in writing by Members of Congress relating to flight procedures or other data affecting their district within 90 days and requires FAA staff to appear at a meeting or town hall with a Member of Congress with 30 days&#8217; notice.   Notify Officials to Inform Fully and Impel Educated Decisions (NOTIFIED) Act: If the FAA proposes a new or modified flight path, it would be required to notify City Councils, Boards of Supervisors, Members of Congress, and Aviation Roundtables within 5 miles of the flight path in question.  Letters Anna Wrote and Cosigned  Letter to DC Chief of Police and the State Department on Turkish President&#8217;s Visit  I joined 40 Members of Congress in sending two letters to ensure the safety of Americans demonstrating against Turkish President Recep Erdogan&#8217;s visit to the nation&#8217;s capital. The letters were sent to the U.S. State Department and the Metro Police Department of the District of Columbia requesting each entity protect Americans&#8217; rights to assemble and speak out against Erdogan, as well as ensure their safety while doing so. In a previous visit by the Turkish President, his security detail attacked American protesters. This behavior is unacceptable, and the police and State Department must ensure the security and well-being of Americans who choose to protest the Erdogan regime&#8217;s record on human rights. You can read the letters here.&nbsp;  Weekly Highlights  Telephone Town Halls  This week I held two evening Tele-Town Hall Meetings with constituents from communities in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties. Approximately 1,600 constituents participated in each meeting and they asked wide-ranging questions on climate change, impeachment, immigration, health care, secure elections, and more. Constituents consistently tell me how valuable they think these meetings are, and they are for me as well. My thanks to the over 3,200 people who participated in the calls. I will continue to make these calls on a consistent basis so my constituents can speak to me directly and have me answer their questions. To listen to previous Telephone Town Halls, click here.  Meeting with Members of the Armenian Parliament    I met with five Members of the Armenian Parliament in Washington, D.C. this week. It was a privilege to discuss with them the importance of the U.S.-Armenian relationship and the recent passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution.  Innovating for Impact Award   It was an honor to receive the Innovating for Impact &#8220;Congressional Champion&#8221; Award from the Global Health Technologies Coalition.&nbsp; My legislation, the Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness Act, and creating the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) was recognized for advancing products that protect U.S. health security interests and, by extension, bolster global health security.  In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. So far this year, over 101,700 constituents have contacted me, and this month, 7,197 constituents have weighed in so far. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments. This week, 1,364 constituents contacted our office, including:   166 constituents wrote to me in support of impeachment   129 constituents wrote to me in support of H.R. 3, the&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act   102 constituents wrote to me in support of the Better Energy Storage Act  Anna&#8217;s Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from.&nbsp;  San Jose Mercury News Column (11/8/2019) &#150; &#8220;Magid: It&#8217;s about time we had more control over our data&#8221;  Larry Magid wrote about the legislation Rep.

LEGISLATION 47TH DISTRICT ABOUT ALAN CONTACT ALAN &nbsp;                In This Edition  I was proud to support the passage in the House this week of nine pieces of legislation to help our veterans.  Public televised hearings as part of the House impeachment inquiry began this week. I joined with my colleagues this week in passing a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank that helps so many American businesses access customers abroad. The Supreme Court this week heard oral arguments in a case that will likely decide the future of the DACA program and the DREAMers it protects.  This week, I spoke at a Congressional forum on the unprecedented increase in the detention and deportation of Southeast Asian Americans under the Trump Administration. I was in the district for Veterans Day where I was proud to meet with and honor veterans of the Vietnam War.  In the Inbox this edition, I feature my response to constituents concerned about possible mining near the Grand Canyon.  If you ever wondered what the relationship between C-SPAN and Congress is, Congress U this edition might have your answer.  Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to look at last week&#8217;s poll results, and make sure you take this week&#8217;s poll in the right-hand column.

I voted for the Deborah Sampson Act &#150; an historic and comprehensive package of bills to improve the lives of more than 2 million women veterans by addressing a wide range of health issues ranging from health care access to delivery of treatment.  Here is a full list of the nine pieces of legislation the House passed this week:  , Protect the GI Bill Act , Reducing High Risk to Veterans and Veterans Services Act, VA Tele-Hearing Modernization Act, VA Overpayment Accountability Act, Protecting Families of Fallen Servicemembers ActH.R. 4162, GI Bill Planning Act of 2019, VA Design-Build Construction Enhancement Act of 2019 , Fallen Warrior Battlefield Cross Memorial ActH.R. 3224, Deborah Sampson Act Public Impeachment Hearings Begin  Independent, credible and non-partisan witnesses this week laid out a shocking pattern of behavior by President Trump and his administration. The rough summary of the call which the White House made public shows the president soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election from Ukraine President Zelensky. The solicitation itself is a crime, but the president&#8217;s abuse of power is bigger than a phone call.  Witness after witness continues to testify that there was an all-out effort by the president and his associates to extort Ukraine and smear Vice President Biden. It is the duty of the House to detail the evidence and if merited, hold the president accountable. Reauthorizing The Ex-Im Bank To Help Businesses In The District  I was proud to vote this week to pass , legislation which reauthorizes our Export-Import Bank for ten years. Over the past five years, the bank has financed $80 million in exports from 10 businesses in the 47th congressional district alone&#151;including nine small businesses.  This financing helps businesses compete in a highly competitive and uncertain global marketplace. I&#8217;m glad the House acted to reauthorize this crucial agency and hope the Senate will act swiftly to make sure that businesses across the country can continue to rely on this financing. Protecting DREAMers  There are 12,000 DREAMers eligible under DACA in the 47th district, and more than 700,000 nationwide. They are as American as any of us. Brought here as children, they have built lives, contribute to our communities and make our country stronger.  The Supreme Court this week heard oral arguments in a case that will decide, when the ruling comes down next year, whether the president has the ability to shut down the program.  DREAMers deserve long-term security. Earlier this year, I was proud to vote for H.R.6, the American Dream and Promise Act, to provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of our friends and neighbors covered under the DACA program.  We cannot abandon them. Hearing On Asian Pacific American Immigration Issues  This week, I spoke at a Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) forum led by my friend and colleague Congresswoman Judy Chu (CA-27). The forum featured witness testimony on the unprecedented increase in the detention and deportation of Southeast Asian Americans under the Trump Administration. Many of the impacted individuals came to the United States as refugees fleeing violence from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and have lived in the U.S. for decades. Just as an example, under the Trump Administration, deportations of Cambodian Americans between 2017 and 2018 have increased 279 percent. The increase in Vietnamese Americans being deported over the same period have risen nearly 180 percent.  The 47th district has the largest Cambodian American population in the country, and also one of the largest Vietnamese American communities. Immigration is an issue that deeply impacts many residents of the 47th district.  The Trump Administration has little regard for the consequences its cruel and indiscriminate deportation policy has on families and communities. Many of these individuals do not know of a home other than the United States.  This is a human rights issue that requires a humane and compassionate solution&#151;a solution I will continue to fight for. We cannot simply cast aside members of our communities and deport them to a place they do not know. This is clearly wrong and not what we stand for as a nation.      A Veterans Day Message  I was deeply touched to spend Veterans Day with my colleague, Congressman Lou Correa, honoring and meeting with veterans of the Vietnam War in our community &#151; many of whom have not received the recognition and gratitude they deserve. Every man and women who has put on a uniform in service of our country has put their lives on the line to defend our nation and the Constitution it is built on. Our immense debt to those who serve does not end when they take off that uniform.  Our responsibility to those who serve is, if anything, amplified once they finish their service. It is our duty to pay our debt to our veterans in full.&nbsp;  Veterans Day is part of that payment. We put aside this day every year to collectively pause and show our deepest appreciation to everyone who has served. Because it is from that service that we are guaranteed the rights and freedoms we enjoy every day of the year.  We can never repay our veterans in kind. But we can do our very best to honor our debt to them by advocating for them, fighting for them, and supporting them--not just today, but every day of the year.       Hundreds of constituents contact my office every week to express their concerns, support, or other views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents on the topic of possible uranium mining being allowed in close proximity to the Grand Canyon. Below is my response to those messages: &#8220;As you know, in early 2018 President Trump directed then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to prioritize the extraction of critical minerals and the Trump Administration is currently revising an Obama-era rule prohibiting the mining of uranium on public lands adjacent to the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; I share your concerns, and I oppose any action to open the Grand Canyon for uranium mining. As the Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee&#8217;s Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, which oversees mining on federal lands, I work with my colleagues to ensure that energy production is developed in a safe and environmentally conscious manner.&nbsp; You will be happy to hear that I am an original cosponsor of H.R.1373, which would permanently ban uranium mining in the Grand Canyon. I was proud to vote for this legislation when it passed the House in October of 2019. Not only does the Grand Canyon attract many visitors for both educational and recreational uses, but it also serves as a natural wildlife habitat.&nbsp; Further, this area acts as a source of groundwater for the Havasupai Tribe and is essential for their survival.&nbsp; In America, no one should have to worry whether or not their water is safe to consume.&nbsp; I support efforts to ensure that every American has access to clean drinking water and will continue my work in Congress to make sure that our nation&#8217;s infrastructure is properly maintained and funded. I stand by my long record of achievement in the California State Legislature and I am proud of my 95% lifetime score from the California League of Conservation Voters.&nbsp; Rest assured that I will continue to advocate for strong and active protection of the Grand Canyon and other national treasures.&#8221;  If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.

The cable channel first began broadcasting live, unedited footage of House proceedings in 1975 and live, unedited footage of Senate proceedings on C-SPAN2 starting in 1986. Established as a private, nonprofit organization, C-SPAN is funded by a $0.06 per subscriber fee paid by cable providers. C-SPAN operates without advertisements and operates independently--neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of the content of its programming. Access to the C-SPAN cable channels is free, as is access to the C-SPAN website where all three channels can be viewed.  The cameras on the House and Senate floors (and many hearing rooms) that C-SPAN pulls feeds from are actually owned and maintained by the respective legislative bodies, not C-SPAN. A 2013 study found that approximately 47 million Americans, or 24% of adult cable viewers, watch C-SPAN weekly.

A year ago this month, I was elected to serve you in Congress. I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but the position comes with lots of new names. Some of those new names are &#151; you guessed it &#151; not so nice. But there is one I can&#8217;t help but relish: &#8220;The Cable Guy.&#8221;  Some Washington lobbyist shouted it out to me in the halls shortly after I introduced my first bill, the &#8220;Transparency for Cable Consumers Act&#8221; (H.R. 1555). My bill would provide much-needed oversight of cable and internet providers, like Charter Spectrum.    Under the bill, if a cable or internet company is fined by a state Public Service Commission &#151; like New York fined Spectrum at my urging &#151; the company would be required to do a lot of things it really doesn&#8217;t want to do, but should.  So how much House support has my common sense bill to hold a powerful corporation just a bit more accountable to customers garnered?  You guessed again &#151; very little.  In fact, there is one &#151; just one &#151; fellow member of the House supporting my plan to hold Spectrum&#8217;s feet to the fire. And my bill now sits in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Right where Spectrum &#151; and some of their favorite members of Congress &#151; want it.  This is unacceptable. And I am going to fight.    Why?  Well, Spectrum just raised our rates again, adding insult to injury. And let me tell you something, they are laughing all the way to the bank. Quite literally.  Wall Street shares of Charter Communications climbed about 14 percent higher last month thanks, in part, to a &#8220;boost from higher prices.&#8221;  According to industry reports, third quarter earnings revealed an increase in customers by about 300,000, a rapid add of broadband subscribers and a loss of cable viewers. Company CEO Tom Rutledge celebrated the revenue strategy as &#8220;working.&#8221;  Of course you make money when you raise our rates again and again, Tom.  Look, it&#8217;s no secret. Spectrum Charter hates me. But what&#8217;s more offending, really, is that they think I&#8217;ll be quiet.  So I am all but shouting-out my plan to hold Spectrum accountable in upcoming federal budget negotiations, where I will work to insert language Spectrum will have to fight like a dog to remove.    What does the &#8220;language&#8221; do and why should Spectrum be worried?  Well, it demands that no later than 180 days after passage of the federal budget the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must submit to Congress a report that does three things:  1) Details actions to protect consumers from predatory actions by cable and internet companies, which includes debt collection methods.  2) Asks the FCC itself to propose appropriate regulatory consequences for cable or internet companies fined by a state public service commission, like Spectrum was.  3) Establishes a working group to investigate the rising rates we all continue to see in this industry.  Moreover, I would like to see the Federal Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) be a part of this working group because we&#8217;ll need their cooperation to fully promote and enforce new rules or actions, especially as it concerns predatory actions.  For example, constituents have reported to me Spectrum&#8217;s ties to a debt collection company called Credit Management, LP. Spectrum allegedly uses the Plano, Texas, company &#151; whose leadership team is tethered to the cable industry -- to collect debts often unrelated to standard non-payment, and instead tied to Spectrum &#8220;equipment.&#8221; I urge anyone being harassed by Credit Management, LP, on behalf of Spectrum, to call my office.  But the duping doesn&#8217;t stop there, and it extends beyond New York.  Investigative reporters in Portland, Maine, just detailed how a quiet change in Spectrum policy means &#8220;in some cases, you&#8217;ll keep paying, even if you cancel.&#8221;  I am looking into this situation, as well. But the point is that our local misgivings with Spectrum are a federal problem.    Look, there is a lot of agreement when it comes to demanding the government get out of the way, but when it comes to mega companies, their millionaire and billionaire CEOs, and the collective undermining of the American consumer, the feds need to deploy cops on the beat.  The legislative branch, of which I am included, is one partner in the fight but we need the administration to empower its agencies and regulators to come down hard on Spectrum when they take advantage of us. Right now, I do not see it happening.  Instead, I see industry smiling ear-to-ear while it courts &#151; and &#8220;pays&#8221; &#151; members of Congress to do its bidding.  Well, let me be the first to reiterate: this &#8220;cable guy&#8221; will not quit until Spectrum blinks, and takes its hand out of your pocket.

Today, the first public hearings took place as Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats continue their attempts to undo the 2016 Presidential election through a sham impeachment inquiry. While impeachment has consumed all of Congress's focus, there are still serious issues that the American people need addressed.&nbsp;Rather than passing the USMCA, working across the aisle to lower the cost of prescription drugs, securing the border, funding the government, or focusing on national security threats in the Intel Committee, Democrats are showing the country that partisan attacks and undermining the President is truly their top priority.  &nbsp;   Telephone Town Hall I'm excited to announce I will be hosting my next telephone town hall on November 19th starting at 6:30PM.

I sought answers from Boeing executives on the lack of oversight and accountability that caused the 737 MAX tragedies and met with representatives of United Steelworkers.&nbsp;Recently, I&#8217;ve also introduced job training legislation with Senator Menendez and testified at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the conflict in Syria.   Legislation Meetings Boeing Foreign Affairs   Legislation  I joined with Senator Menendez (D-NJ) to introduce our bicameral legislation, the Better Education and Skills Training (BEST) for America&#8217;s Workforce Act. H.R. 4848 seeks to increase employment opportunities in New Jersey by uniting the strength of our local businesses with our community colleges. This bill would create a $1 billion tax-credit program that institutions could use to create job-training partnerships with businesses, placing students or trainees into our community&#8217;s present employment gaps. Additionally, local businesses would be eligible to receive $4,000 in tax credits for the tuition costs of training and hiring long-term unemployed workers, specifically covering required certifications or training credentials. &nbsp; Grants would be awarded on a competitive basis with opportunities that create long-term job and income security receiving preferential consideration. The BEST for America&#8217;s Workforce Act is currently under review by the House Committee on Education &amp; Labor and the House Committee on Ways &amp; Means.  On Thursday, I voted in favor of H.Res.660, introduced by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), to formalize the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. H.Res.660 establishes the essential procedures and rules that will govern the next stage of the ongoing investigation into alleged actions by the President. It is imperative to our democracy that no American is above the law and any abuses of power in our government should be swiftly remediated. H.Res.660 passed by a vote of 232-196. Last&nbsp;Wednesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed my bipartisan resolution H.Res.546, which disapproves of Russia&#8217;s inclusion in future Group of Seven (G7) summits until it respects the sovereignty of its neighboring countries and adheres to the standards of democratic societies. Russia was expelled in 2014 as a direct result of its aggressive actions in Ukraine. In August 2019, the President announced his intention to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to the 2020 summit even though Russia has become even more aggressive towards Ukraine and has undermined democratic institutions around the world, including here in the United States. International democratic standards cannot be compromised. I thank my colleagues for their support and call for a vote on H.Res.546 on the House floor.  During the same markup, the House Foreign Affairs Committee also passed my bipartisan resolution with Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), H.Res.649, which recognizes the 50th anniversary of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF). Founded by Congress in 1969, the IAF is an independent government agency that channels development assistance directly to marginalized and underserved communities in the Western Hemisphere. Providing over 5,000 community-led grants, the IAF has been an indispensable resource for small-scale entrepreneurship and the economic development in the region for the past five decades.  Meetings&nbsp;  Members of United Steelworkers met with me&nbsp;last Wednesday to discuss current issues in labor rights. We discussed my co-sponsorship of H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019, introduced by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), which strengthens protections for collective bargaining. I emphasized my support for the hard working men and women of the steel industry and my commitment to fair employment for all Americans.  Boeing  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee convened&nbsp;last Wednesday to receive answers from Boeing on the recent 737 MAX disasters. As a member of the committee, I asked President and CEO of the Boeing Company, Dennis Muilenburg, directly about his decision to ignore dramatic warnings from his own employees about the safety of these aircraft. With the families of the victims in the chamber, it cannot be overstated the duty our travel industry has to uphold the highest safety standards for consumers.  In one email, a senior manager desperately cautioned his supervisors, &#8220;schedule pressure is creating a culture where employees are either deliberately or unconsciously circumventing established processes.&#8221; And yet his warnings went ignored. Profits cannot be valued over human lives and Boeing must take every measure possible to establish safety and accountability moving forward.  Foreign Affairs   On Wednesday, October 23, 2019, I spoke about my concern over the alignment of our President with presidents Putin and Erdogan and its effects on America&#8217;s foreign policy.   On October 23rd, I spoke at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the conflict in Syria and expressed my concern over what I believe is America&#8217;s diminishing place in global politics. I believe when the President works too closely with leaders like Putin and Erdogan, it hurts America&#8217;s credibility as a reliable partner and damages our global influence. My colleagues and I questioned Administration officials on the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Northern Syria. I will continue to speak out and pressure the Administration to make democracy, human rights, and the rule of the law the essential pillars of our foreign policy.  Later that day, I chaired a Western Hemisphere Subcommittee hearing on the Administration&#8217;s FY2020 budget request and U.S. policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean. I expressed my deep concerns about what I view as the Administration&#8217;s efforts to eliminate the right to seek asylum for those fleeing Central America and its cuts to our foreign assistance programs in the region. I also pressed administration officials on the impact of our assistance to Mexico under the Merida Initiative, our strategy for promoting a democratic transition in Venezuela, and the status of the State Department&#8217;s efforts to secure repayment of $57 million in Peruvian land bonds owed to pensioners in New Jersey. This hearing should have taken place at the beginning of the 116th Congress, but the former Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Kim Breier, has not appeared to testify. I am glad we were finally able to hold the hearing and I will continue advocating for U.S. engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean.  Last week, I met with Alfonso Silva, the Ambassador from Chile, to discuss the recent reports of excessive violence against peaceful protestors. I expressed to him my concern for the people of Chile and emphasized my support for efforts to bolster democracy. My colleagues and I on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee will continue to monitor the situation. The following day, I met with Julio Borges and Carlos Vecchio, representatives of the interim government of Venezuela President Juan Guaid&#243;, along with members of Venezuela&#8217;s National Assembly. The world cannot lose sight of the crisis in Venezuela and must remain vigilant until human rights and the rule of law are restored. Over 4.5 million Venezuelans have been forced to leave their homes as the Maduro regime continues to plunder resources. We cannot look away from this humanitarian crisis.&nbsp;  Thank you for reading the Washington Review.&nbsp;Hearing from my constituents enables me to be a better representative of the 8th District.

Previous estimates had put the cost of Medicare for All at $32 trillion over ten years. But a recent study by the left-leaning Urban Institute pegs the tab at $34 trillion. An additional $2 trillion is no small sum. That money represents half the current federal budget, three times what our country spends on our military, and more than the value of all of the goods and services produced in Canada every year. The revised $34 trillion total is another reminder of how unsustainable Medicare for All would be. The bill&#8217;s sponsor, Senator Bernie Sanders, has openly acknowledged that only massive middle-class tax increases could pay for what it would require. Costs are not the only concern. The policy would take away Americans&#8217; health-care choices, increase wait times, and limit the potential for future medical innovations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act &#150; also known as Obamacare &#150; has already shown what can happen when the government&#8217;s role in health care grows. Prices skyrocketed and people could not keep the plans or doctors they liked. Americans are right to wonder why it would be wise to double down on the mistakes of the past.&nbsp; Insurance Provided at Work Would End  Proponents of Medicare for All should stop repeating outlandish promises. They should come to the table and engage productively. That is the only way to find a solution that would give more Americans the care they want at the time they need it from the doctors they trust. Proposals should not throw out what works about America&#8217;s health-care system, including what works about Medicare. More than 600,000 Mississippians over the age of 65 rely on Medicare. Medicare for All would immediately take away options like Medicare Advantage, and it would eventually empty the U.S. Treasury. With no money left to spend, Medicare for All would become Medicare for none. Medicare for All would also make most of the existing private insurance market illegal, taking away coverage from more than 180 million people. A new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 76 percent of participants like the coverage they get on the job. That type of insurance would end if Medicare for All became the law of the land. The Way Forward  Americans deserve a say in their health-care choices, which are some of the most personal decisions that anyone can make. Given the proper tools and regulatory framework, our citizens are more than capable of picking the best plans to fit their needs. President Donald Trump has made empowering consumers, lowering costs, and keeping protections for people with preexisting conditions top priorities. His administration has given small businesses the option to join together in associations to negotiate lower prices. It has also granted waivers from some of the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s burdensome mandates on insurance exchanges so that states can customize coverage options for their residents&#8217; health needs. Congress is taking action as well. The Republican Senate recently voted to keep these waivers in place.&nbsp; I cosponsored legislation to protect existing association health plans and expand their benefits to more than 400,000 uninsured Americans. I also recently introduced the bipartisan CONNECT for Health Act of 2019, which would grow access to telehealth services in rural parts of our country like the Mississippi Delta. Republicans on Capitol Hill are ready to work with our Democratic colleagues on health care. But Medicare for All is a dangerous distraction. It would prevent positive reforms and could cause devastating results.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Other news this week:  &nbsp;  Wicker Statement on House Impeachment Vote  Wicker Hyde-Smith Lead Effort to Expand Telehealth Services  Wicker Votes to Maintain State Waivers for Obamacare Mandates  Wicker Statement on Death of ISIS Leader     &nbsp;    Follow me on Facebook for daily updates  Follow me on Instagram&nbsp;for behind the scenes photos&nbsp;  Follow me on Twitter for my most recent statements   Unsubscribe to future eNewsletters here.

Senate Passes My CJS Appropriations Bill This week, the Senate passed my FY2020 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act with overwhelming support. This bill funds the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and many other agencies. Specifically, this legislation invests in federal law enforcement agencies, state and local law enforcement grants, space exploration, scientific research, economic development programs, trade enforcement, ocean observations, and weather forecasting. This CJS bill is fiscally responsible and prioritizes important federal programs that support economic development, law enforcement, and scientific innovation. I&#8217;m especially pleased that this bill accelerates the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon and cements America&#8217;s leadership in space exploration. I am proud to have worked closely with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to produce a good government, bipartisan bill that enables numerous agencies within our jurisdiction to accomplish their missions, keep communities safe, and address the needs of our nation.&#8221; Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch my remarks on this bill.&nbsp;  &nbsp;USDA Selects New Headquarters Location in Kansas City This week, USDA announced that 805 Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Kansas City has been selected as the new site for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). I&#8217;ve long advocated that USDA&#8217;s ERS and NIFA relocate to the Kansas City metropolitan area knowing that regardless of what side of the border these facilities would land, it would be a positive development for the regional economy and so many institutions across Kansas and Missouri. I applaud the many entities across Kansas City who have worked to bring these agencies closer to the producers they serve. In addition, I&#8217;m committed to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan, bicameral way to secure the resources necessary for USDA to complete this move and to welcome their employees to Kansas City. Questioning Boeing CEO on the 737 MAX and the Future of Aviation Safety On Tuesday, during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I had the opportunity to question Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg on important issues regarding the now-grounded Boeing 737 MAX airplane. It is critical we find out what went wrong and investigate current policies and protocols to ensure similar tragedies don&#8217;t happen again. As the aviation industry is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, I&#8217;m committed to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure safety in the aviation industry is always the top priority. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch our discussion.&nbsp;    Announcing NIST Grant to Pittsburg State University On&nbsp;Wednesday, I was pleased to announce a grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Kansas Technology Center at Pittsburg State University. This award will help establish a recyclable plastics modeling and testing laboratory, and will allow PSU to continue leading the region and the country in polymers and plastics research.&nbsp;In order to compete in a global economy and to protect our country from adversaries, it&#8217;s important our businesses and manufacturers remain on the cutting edge. As the chief appropriator for the U.S. Department of Commerce and NIST, I&#8217;ll continue working with PSU officials to grow their expertise in this important field.

The Sports Fans Coalition is a national non-profit advocacy group devoted to protecting the rights of the fan wherever public policy impacts the games we love. With new technological advances coming seemingly every day, we must ensure our fans are being treated fairly. My&nbsp;BOTS Act, which was signed into law in 2016, would do just that. The&nbsp;BOTS Act&nbsp;prohibits ticket scalpers from using automated purchasing technology to quickly buy large amounts of event tickets before the average fan has an opportunity to make a purchase, ultimately decreasing consumer choice and driving up prices. In addition, we discussed my work with Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to protect Olympic and amateur athletes from abuse. I appreciate their thoughtful and productive conversation on how we can all work together &#150; regardless of position or responsibility &#150; to end the abuse of athletes.&nbsp;I will continue to work with the Sports Fans Coalition and my Senate colleagues to protect fans from those that wish to take advantage of their passion.    Discussing Infrastructure and Transportation with Civic Council of Greater KC On Monday, I had the opportunity to meet with the KC Civic Council &#150; a nonprofit organization composed of some of the largest, private employers in the Kansas City area. During the meeting, we discussed critical issues to the KC area including infrastructure, workforce and trade issues. The meeting gave us a chance to discuss my Startup Act legislation which encourages job creation, innovation and advances economic development. This legislation will encourage growth in the KC area by developing policies that help recruit and retain highly-skilled students and innovators, and enable entrepreneurs to transform their ideas into companies. The legislation is supported by a diverse group of industry in the KC area, and I look forward to continuing to push for its final passage.&nbsp;    Junction City Welcome Home Ceremony  On Saturday, I was honored to join our 1st Infantry Division soldiers and their families at Junction City's Welcome Home Celebration. During the celebration, it was announced that Junction City was awarded as one of this year&#8217;s Great American Defense Communities. And this celebration was evidence of why Junction City is known as one of the best Army hometowns in the country. Welcome home to Fort Riley soldiers who have been deployed across the globe over 2019, and a big thank you to the All American Beef Battalion for serving our active duty soldiers at the event.    Hosting a Ness County Townhall Meeting On Friday, I was in Ransom to host a Ness County Listening Tour Stop. During this stop, we discussed a number of issues including veterans&#8217; access to healthcare and implementation of the&nbsp;VA MISSION Act, agriculture and the importance of passing USMCA, our work to make certain rural America can thrive, the ongoing impeachment proceedings, challenges in rural healthcare delivery and border security. Thanks to all those who took time to visit with me on Friday, and thank you to Herb Schwartzkopf and the Ransom VFW for hosting my visit to the community.    Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C.

Shockingly, with this vote, they've made their unfair, backroom inquiry even worse. This resolution gives House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff more power, limits member involvement even more, and again fails to give the President of the United States the due process he deserves. The most egregious part of this vote, though, is that it will continue to waste the American people's time. The Senate has already said that impeachment is dead on arrival. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are preventing the House from doing real work to continue this witch hunt that is not going anywhere. House Democrats have issued more subpoenas this Congress than bills signed into law under their leadership. It's clear that their priority is overturning the 2016 election, not working to improve the lives of Americans. We have all seen the transcript. We have all seen the whistleblower report. There is nothing there. This must end now. BUDDY'S BRIEFING This week on Buddy's Briefing, we discuss the raid that killed the leader of ISIS, my legislation that was approved this week to increase transparency in the prescription drug supply chain and the Democrat's impeachment resolution.

As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, our office has received a number of calls regarding the shortage. After reviewing the situation with the FDA and being assured the shortage has been rectified, I head to the House Chamber for what turns out to be one of the most momentous vote series in recent history. For only the fourth time in our nations history, the Democrats pass a resolution that officially calls for an impeachment inquiry of President Donald J. Trump. House Republicans discuss the impeachment vote After this sham process is passed with bipartisan opposition- all Republicans and two Democrats voted against the resolution - I join many of my Republican colleagues in the Rayburn room for a press conference to address this extremely disappointing development before heading to the airport for my return trip home. Once I land in Savannah, I have on camera interviews with WJCL-TV and WSAV-TV in Savannah to discuss the impeachment vote.

The House Leadership has spent the past 35 days selectively leaking information to the press from their private investigation in order to cause a media frenzy and sway public opinion. Now under pressure, they are coming to the table with a resolution to move forward with the promise of some transparency, despite the fact that the resolution does not require the proceedings to be open and transparent. The resolution also does not allow the President to be represented in the proceedings in a meaningful way, which was the case for Presidents Nixon and Clinton. This measure is a political stunt, rather than a legitimate attempt to conduct a fair and transparent process. And I will not participate in it.  Of specific concern, the impeachment process outlined in the resolution is bifurcated, with one committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), conducting its proceedings in the shadows while another committee, Judiciary, votes on articles it has not investigated.   This resolution states that the President and his Counsel are afforded protections throughout Judiciary Committee Proceedings, but not during the ongoing HPSCI investigation. The resolution does not require Chairman Schiff to release all materials acquired by HPSCI during its investigation to the Judiciary Committee. This means the President and his Counsel will be unable to review all the evidence submitted, question all witnesses, or object to certain evidence. The President and the Judiciary Committee will only be able to consider evidence that the Chairman of the HPSCI decides to transmit. This creates the possibility that only evidence that condemns the President will be transmitted, with exculpatory evidence being forced aside. No defendant in any proceeding should be treated this way. While the procedures adopted by the Rules Committee on behalf of the Judiciary Committee include similar protections for the President as were adopted during the impeachment proceedings for Presidents Nixon and Clinton, those same protections do not extend to the entire impeachment investigation as they have in the past. Finally, the procedures, unlike those adopted in the Clinton and Nixon impeachments, allow Chairman Nadler to unilaterally eliminate any of the protections afforded to the President if he perceives the President to be uncooperative with the investigation. Republicans offered 17 amendments in the Rules Committee prior to the vote, but they were ALL rejected.  Despite this impeachment-related circus, my sense is that the American public expects more from its leaders than the inflammatory discourse that has dominated the headlines in recent months, and I remain committed to working on the real issues that affect the day to day lives of my constituents. I am proud that we were able to make some progress on items last week which will actually help solve problems facing our country. Continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts on your behalf.  Learning from You  Tomorrow (Monday, November 4, 2019) night at 6:00 p.m., I will be hosting a tele-town hall. This forum allows a maximum number of constituents to participate. On average, several thousand constituents join in each tele-town hall for the entire hour-long exchange. This is just one of the multiple ways that I communicate with my constituents on a regular basis. I look forward to the opportunity to provide a brief update of what I have been working on in Washington and answer your questions. The system will be randomly dialing constituents; however, if you want to ensure your participation, you can call in directly at 1-888-480-3641.  Defeating Evil and Keeping Americans Safe  Last weekend&#8217;s successful operation leading to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the culmination of years of dedicated and coordinated effort to root out terrorism. Al-Baghdadi and the cowards around him are responsible for horrific and depraved violence, including the deaths of Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller. There is no place on earth for these cowards to hide, as we remain steadfast in our resolve to decimate ISIS and other terrorist organizations. May God continue to bless the men and women in our Armed Forces who are on the front lines in the War Against Terror. Their continued service and sacrifice help to keep our nation safe!  As co-Chairman of the Humane Bond Caucus, I have had the privilege to advocate on behalf of our military hero dogs. This hero dog is credited with helping our Special Forces unit in its successful mission to hunt down the ISIS terror leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. These well-trained animals are an incredible asset to our military, and we must always ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.   Another part of keeping America safe is holding our supposed allies accountable. Sadly, we have seen over the last several years, under Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s leadership, that Turkey has not consistently met this standard. Last week, the House took bold action in defense of our nation by passing measures regarding Turkey&#8217;s nefarious role in destabilizing the Middle East. The Protect Against Conflict by Turkey (PACT) Act, which I co-sponsored, enacts sanctions against Turkey for its egregious conduct. Turkey&#8217;s actions in Syria have caused numerous civilian deaths, worsened the existing humanitarian crisis, and further destabilized the region. This is not the behavior that we expect from a so-called American ally. In fact, the only entities which stand to benefit from Turkey&#8217;s actions are known bad actors on the international stage who do not have America&#8217;s best interests at heart, such as Vladimir Putin, Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Islamic extremists. We must hold Turkey accountable for its flagrant disregard for U.S. interests, and send a strong message to the international community that we are serious when it comes to defending our national security. Click&nbsp;here to watch me speak about this important matter on the House Floor.&nbsp;  Preventing Suicide  Last week I&nbsp;filed bipartisan legislation with Congressman Engel to help combat the recent spike in the national suicide rate. Since 2001, the suicide rate in the United States has risen by a shocking 31%, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death in the nation, with an estimated 47,000 lives lost each year. To curb this growing problem, the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act will fund grants to assist emergency departments in developing protocols for identifying, assessing and treating individuals at risk for suicide.  This proactive approach is vital because emergency departments are often the first, and sadly too often the only, point of contact within the healthcare system for those most at risk for suicide, such as those with severe mental health conditions or substance use disorders. A 2016 study found that 11% of all emergency department patients exhibited suicidal ideation. However, only 3% of those patients were diagnosed by current screening tools. Additionally, statistics show that up to 70% of patients who leave the emergency department after a suicide attempt never attend their first outpatient follow-up appointment.  These staggering statistics make it clear that we need improved methods for identifying and assessing the suicide risks of emergency department patients. As part of my long-term commitment to fixing our broken mental health care system, I want to be sure that we enhance the procedures surrounding the discharge of patients who have attempted suicide or exhibit suicidal ideation to maximize the likelihood that they obtain appropriate follow-up care. Our bill is the first step in making that happen.   Helping Seniors  Last week, I was proud to vote in favor of the Dignity in Aging Act which improves and reauthorizes the Older Americans Act (OAA). OAA has helped provide social and nutrition services to seniors for more than 50 years. In addition to well-known programs like Meals on Wheels, the OAA helps more than 41 million Americans maintain independence, prevent costly hospitalizations and live longer, healthier lives.   Additionally, Medicare Open Enrollment began November 1. In the state of Florida, SHINE provides counseling about the options available to seniors. SHINE is a non-profit organization funded by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs. Call 1800-96-ELDER if you (or a senior in your life) need additional help determining which options will best meet your needs. You can also watch this brief&nbsp;video from the Department of Health and Human Services to learn about changes for the upcoming year.&nbsp; Advocating for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  I am once again partnering with local dentists and Pasco Hernando State College to provide free dental care to Veterans in our community this Friday, November 8, 2019. A limited number of appointments are available to Veterans in need for cleanings, fillings and extractions. Please contact my office at 727-232-2921 if you need these services.   Last week, I was proud to vote in favor of the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act of 2019, which passed the House. This bill sets up a Veteran Treatment Court program at the Department of Justice, providing grants and assistance to state &amp; local entities for Veteran treatment courts. Our community already has a robust treatment court that works with a significant number of Veterans in need of help. I&#8217;ve seen how well the program works and believe it should be expanded throughout the nation in order to assist our heroes.   In last week&#8217;s VA Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee&#8217;s hearing we&nbsp;examined the implementation of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act and the VA&#8217;s decision to delay processing the benefits until the new year. While I appreciate the VA&#8217;s commitment to get the job done the right way, I remain concerned by the potential for further processing delays &#150; these Veterans have waited long enough.  Last week&#8217;s VA Committee mark-up hearing was also frustrating. We usually place the needs of Veterans above partisan politics; however, the Chairman deviated from that tradition. I was saddened that the Chairman refused to allow debate and amendments to strengthen legislation that would support Veterans at-risk of suicide, remove barriers to mental health care for Veterans, and protect Veterans&#8217; children from child predators. These amendments are supported by Veterans Service Organizations and were offered by Members of Congress who are themselves Veterans. In the future, I hope my colleagues will return to our time-honored tradition of leaving politics at the door when it comes to doing the right thing for Veterans.  Improving Healthcare  Each year I hold a Nurses&#8217; roundtable event to get feedback from those on the front lines of our healthcare system about how Congress can improve the quality of care patients receive. This year, local nurses asked that I help push for the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act. I became a co-sponsor of this important initiative and I am proud to share that it passed the House last week. This important bill will reauthorize federal nursing workforce development grant programs for another five years. Programs include traineeships, loan repayment, and scholarships for nurses to attain advance practice status and become nursing faculty. Continued investment in these programs is necessary to ensure the U.S. has an adequate supply of nurses. Nurses are a critical component of our healthcare system, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to expedite passage of this essential legislation.   I am also proud that another bill I co-sponsored passed the House last week. The Payment Commission Data Act of 2019 will help remove a bureaucratic impediment that currently keeps Congress from receiving the best possible information needed for decision-making on issues related to Medicare and Medicaid. There are existing non-partisan Commissions responsible for making recommendations to Congress about Medicare and Medicaid programs. Currently, these Commissions do not have access to drug pricing data, which limits their ability to analyze and provide information on related topics to Congress, such as issues related to prescription drug costs. Our bill fixes this problem.  Additionally, last week the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced the launch of a website to help connect Americans looking for substance abuse treatment with approximately 13,000 treatment locations across the nation. This is one important step as we seek to improve access to care. Visit&nbsp; to learn more.  Preparing Future Leaders   A special thanks to the members of my Service Academy Nominating Committee. These men and women have proudly served our nation in the military, and are now volunteering their time to interview local candidates who would like to attend a Military Service Academy. Each year I receive dozens of applications from highly qualified young men and women who are seeking my nomination to an Academy. The Nominating Committee has the unenviable job of selecting the best and brightest among a group of elite students. I am confident that they will do an excellent job, and I look forward to meeting the future leaders they select.    Promoting Tourism  Last week, I was able to take a lead role in the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee&#8217;s Legislative Hearing on the Reauthorization of Brand USA. This critical program has a proven track record of success in bringing international tourists to the U.S. without using tax dollars. Its reauthorization is vital.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;here to listen to my remarks.&nbsp; Remaining Competitive   In last week&#8217;s Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing we discussed the fact that China and South Korea are gaining a competitive edge with respect to 5G deployment and the Internet of Things. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my exchange on this topic. It is important that the United States continues to be in a position of strength by quickly reallocating spectrum to the companies on the front lines of emerging technology and innovation.&nbsp;  Setting the Record Straight  I am proud that the United States set the historic record&nbsp;straight by officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide last week. Turkey has for too long denied the historic fact that 1.5 million Armenians and other ethnic and religious minorities were killed by the Ottoman Empire, and the United States will no longer let this historic inaccuracy stand.&nbsp;  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent in Wesley Chapel. Though his issue was not involving a federal agency, my team was able to reach out to the Florida Insurance Commissioner on his behalf to request consideration of their families situation.  &#8220;I am happy to update that our claim against the Insurance company has been resolved. They are reinstating the original policy that was cancelled and there will be no Pre-Existing Condition prior to my wife&#8217;s heart attack. The premiums paid for the replacement policy have been applied retroactively to the original policy. That was always the only thing we wanted, out of fairness. The agent who &#8220;bait-n-switched&#8221; her to another policy 10 days before her heart attack, has been terminated from doing business with the company. Thank you for your efforts.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  Last week, my team met with the leadership of the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#8217;s Office to check on the progress of the new Veteran&#8217;s Pod in the local jail. I am pleased to continue my collaboration with Sheriff Chronister on this project and was glad to see Veteran-created art being hung on the walls of the new pod. I believe that with the great work of the mental health professionals from USF and the Sheriff&#8217;s willingness to work outside the box, we will see meaningful change in the lives of these Veterans.   My team also met with the leadership staff for the regional VA to hear a status report on the implementation of key policy initiatives and program improvements. I will continue to work closely with the VA, both in Washington and at home, to ensure our Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.   My team was fortunate to participate in a Hospitality and Tourism Roundtable discussion in Wesley Chapel last week. As co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Travel and Tourism, I know that tourism is such an important part of our local, state and national economy. It was great to see these leaders sharing ideas about how they can work together to boost tourism throughout Tampa Bay.   Additionally, My team was pleased to attend the Grand Opening Of the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators (NCCCO) with other members of the Greater Palm Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce. NCCCO is a nonprofit organization formed in 1995 with a mission to develop performance standards for safe crane operation to assist all segments of general industry and construction.

The death of this depraved individual is a huge win for America and all the civilized world, and it sends a clear message to those that would use terrorism to pursue their evil ends that they cannot escape the long and mighty arm of the United States military. I thank our President for his decisive leadership in ordering this raid and our special operatives for their courage and bravery in undertaking this extremely dangerous operation.  Tricking the American People From Day 1 of Donald Trump's presidency, House Democrats have tried dressing up their impeachment inquisition as a legitimate inquiry instead of what it really is: a purely political ploy aimed at discrediting and destroying our duly-elected President. That&#8217;s why it is only fitting on Halloween, Democrats tried to put a costume of credibility to disguise their political witch hunt of Donald J. Trump and distract from their radical, socialist policies &#150; which should scare all Americans.  House Democrats&#8217; relentless pursuit of this impeachment scam is hurting our ability to get things done on behalf of the American people like passing USMCA and passing legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. In fact, this Congress, Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have had bills signed into law. It&#8217;s past time for Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s political theater to exit stage left so we can get back to doing our jobs, debating the real issues, and solving real problems.  Bringing the Prescription Drug Pricing Process Out of the Darkness All Americans are rightly concerned about the ever-rising costs of prescription drugs. One of the reasons why drug costs have spiraled out of control is because discounts negotiated by the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)&#150; the middle-men in the drug supply chain &#150; are shrouded in secrecy. Americans are left in the dark about the rebates these PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers, and while we have no idea where the rebate value is going, we know where it&#8217;s not going &#150; to our seniors at the point of sale.  To that end, I&#8217;m proud this week the House passed bipartisan legislation I led that provides more transparency in an otherwise opaque process that will help ensure rebates go towards reducing the cost of drugs for seniors. This legislation also includes the text of my bill, the Shop Rx Act, which requires drug plans for seniors to offer real-time information regarding the various options of drugs and their associated costs. By providing seniors with access to the readily available, relevant information they need in order to be real consumers in the healthcare market, we will empower them with the knowledge to choose the options that best fit their needs and their budget. And because consumers will have more information, they will have more choices and insurers will have to actually compete for their business, which will ultimately bring down the cost of drugs- something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on.

Ushering in American Energy Dominance At the heart of America&#8217;s economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy. American energy independence is undoubtedly a matter of national security, but it's also a question of life &amp; death for our rural communities. In West Texas, energy producers are as crucial to our communities as our educators, healthcare providers, &amp; ag producers. Click here to watch my remarks opposing HR 2181, Democrat-led legislation that would ban future mineral development in an area outside the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which would put a choke-hold on energy production by our New Mexico neighbors and members of the Navajo Nation tribe.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs We continue to see more great news come out about our economy, which was once again confirmed with the latest jobs report. October&#8217;s numbers showed the economy added 128,000 jobs last month, exceeding economists&#8217; expectations. This is just goes to show that President Trump and Republicans&#8217; pro-growth policies have brought greater freedom in the marketplace are helping Americans keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets where it belongs. Now it&#8217;s time to keep our foot on the pedal by passing USMCA and ushering in the 176,000 new jobs that this better, fairer trade deal will deliver.  Hometown Hero Earlier this week, Lubbock Police Department Officer Thomas Thompson, a finalist for the Police Officer of the Year Award, was honored by President Trump at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in Chicago. Officer Thompson is part of a long line of defenders of our democracy as guardians of the public safety and the Rule of Law, and we are all grateful to his bravery and service to keeping the Lubbock community secure and our families safe.

Q&amp;A:&nbsp;LIHEAP Q. What is LIHEAP? Q. Who is eligible to apply?   Quick Links Americans depend on access to safe, quality agricultural products every day. That's why I joined my colleagues in introducing legislation that will&nbsp;address the shortage of agricultural inspectors along our border.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Protecting America&#8217;s Food &amp; Agriculture Act of 2019&nbsp;would authorize U.S. Customs and Border Protection to hire additional inspectors, support staff and canine teams to fully staff our airports, seaports and land ports of entry. Enhanced inspectors along our border will help prevent the spread of diseases like African swine fever which has devastated the pork industry in China. Safety is our top priority and additional agricultural inspectors will work to protect both farmers and consumers  The cost of prescription drugs is too high, plain and simple.&nbsp;There are a lot of factors, but it boils down to the fact that the process of getting a drug from its manufacturer to the patient is too complex, opaque and expensive. To address this ever-growing problem,&nbsp;I authored the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act (PDPRA).&nbsp;Passed by the&nbsp;Senate Finance Committee&nbsp;in July, PDPRA increases transparency and holds drug manufacturers more accountable to taxpayers. It will also save patients and taxpayers money. Read more in my joint op-ed with Senator Braun of Indiana here.  I recently joined my colleagues in introducing a bill to address law enforcement suicides.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act&nbsp;requires the FBI to collect voluntary, anonymous data on police suicides and attempted suicides from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Collecting this data will help inform policy solutions so that law enforcement suicides can be prevented.&nbsp;Members of our law enforcement community are on the front lines of dangerous and highly stressful situations every day. The serious nature of their work can put them at a greater risk of developing issues related to their mental health. It&#8217;s important that we recognize this and reduce the associated stigma. They put&nbsp;our safety first, and it&#8217;s time we return the favor.  President Trump announced Teresa Lynn Davison of Cedar Rapids to be appointed as a&nbsp;member of the Public-Private Partnership Advisory Council to End Human Trafficking. Davison&nbsp;is an asset to our community and to the country. As the founder of the non-profit Chains Interrupted, she has provided countless resources and training to individuals who directly interact and work with survivors of human trafficking every day. Her varied professional roles afford her a unique and much-needed perspective to the council. As Senate president pro tem, I&#8217;m proud to recommend a highly-qualified Iowan for the job. I appreciate the continued work by the Administration to address the issue of human trafficking. Post of the Week   Throughout October we have recognized breast cancer awareness month.

H.R.3055 incorporates the Senate&#8217;s fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and environment and science-related federal agencies.  While our government funding measures have taken too long to pass the Senate due to partisan obstruction, I&#8217;m glad to see this measure move through to support critical government funding for our farmers, national parks, transportation and other areas that make a difference in Americans&#8217; lives. You can read more about Georgia benefits in the legislation here.  However, we have much left to accomplish. Key Georgia priorities including our military bases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project need the assurance of full-year funding. I hope that leaders in the House and Senate will quickly resolve their differences so we can move forward with bipartisan appropriations bills, consistent with the terms they agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act this summer.  Rooting Out Terrorism On Sunday, President Trump announced the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the top leader of the radical Islamic terror group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), following a raid on his compound carried out by U.S. special operations forces in Syria. I applaud the heroic actions by our U.S. special operations forces and intelligence services to root out and eliminate the top leader of the oppressive Islamic State terrorist group. While the threat posed by ISIS and other transnational terrorist organizations in the Middle East continues to persist, we must remain committed to sustained American leadership, in conjunction with our allies and partners, in the fight against terrorism in this very unstable region of the world.  Advancing Bipartisan Health Priorities On Thursday, two bipartisan public health measures that Democratic Senator Bob Casey and I introduced, the Over-the-Counter Drug Safety, Innovation and Reform Act and the Scarlett&#8217;s Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act, passed out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.  The Over-the-Counter Drug Safety, Innovation and Reform Act would streamline and modernize the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (FDA) process regulating how over-the-counter medications are brought to market and monitored for safety and effectiveness. It would also speed up the current years-long approval process for new over-the-counter medications. The Scarlett&#8217;s Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act would strengthen existing efforts to improve prevention of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death and Sudden Unexpected Death in Childhood. Currently, there are no nationwide standards for investigating and collecting data following an infant or child death.  Senator Casey and I have been working for a long time on overhauling our woefully outdated over-the-counter drug approval process to help innovative products get to the pharmacy shelf and to give consumers the most up-to-date safety information on these medications. I have also been honored to work with Senator Casey on ensuring we are employing every resource available to combat infant mortality and protect our youngest and most precious lives. I&#8217;m so glad to see each of these bills pass in committee, and Senator Casey and I will continue working with our colleagues to move them through the Senate.  In Other News  This week, members of my staff participated in a ceremony with several veterans of the Korean War at a Peace Medal Ceremony in Cobb County. More than 165 Georgia veterans of the Korean War were honored in a ceremony that paid tribute to their loyal and brave service during the war and related peacekeeping operations.   Also this week, former Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina sadly passed away after succumbing to complications of the tick-borne Powassan virus.&nbsp;My older sister died at a very young age from the fatal results of a tick bite. I was proud to both cosponsor a resolution to honor Senator Hagan&#8217;s service in the U.S. Senate, and to support the&nbsp;Kay Hagan Tick Act, which we passed Thursday in the Senate health committee to improve research, prevention, diagnostics and treatment.   Monday, Nov. 4, is the 40th anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis, when 66 United States diplomats, military personnel, and civilians were taken hostage from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. I&#8217;ve introduced a resolution commemorating their service to our nation, emphasizing the depth and nature of their sacrifices and suffering and supporting the designation of Nov. 4, 2019, as a national day of remembrance for these victims.  What&#8217;s on Tap? When I return to Washington D.C. we will continue working on government funding measures. On Wednesday, Nov. 6, the Senate Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs will hold a hearing on pending nominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

Most recently, this Congress, I&nbsp; serve on the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. On top of my committee-specific duties related to foreign policy, for the past eight years, my colleague, Congresswoman Susan Davis, and I have led an all-female Congressional&nbsp;Mother&#8217;s Day trip to Afghanistan. During these trips, we have been given the opportunity to meet with our servicemen and women who are away from their families on Mother&#8217;s Day. I believe it is so incredibly important for members of Congress to see firsthand how our policy decisions impact the lives of Americans at home and abroad. I have been able to use what I&#8217;ve learned during these trips to make more informed decisions about military spending and defense policy.   I recently addressed a group at the United States Institute of Peace, and I told them that it is my belief that a peace deal &#150; a true, lasting peace in Afghanistan &#150; will not be reached until all facets of the Afghan community have a seat at the negotiating table. This means Afghan society must continue to see an increased number of women serving in all societal roles &#150; in the military, police force, as educators, and more. The country simply cannot truly move forward until all its citizens have a bettered quality of life, and I will remain engaged in this fight. You can watch my remarks from the event in full here, and read more in my weekly column here.  LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON    Last&nbsp;week,&nbsp;I&nbsp;had the opportunity to meet with Alabamians&nbsp;in Washington. I met with representatives from Hyundai, the Alabama Education Retirees Association, and the Coastal Alabama Partnership.&nbsp;    I appreciated learning more about their initiatives and legislative priorities, as well as the impact their organizations have on the second congressional district.&nbsp;    STAYING ALERT AGAINST FRAUDULENT SCAMS&nbsp;  Every day, we consume information in a variety of ways from our cell phone screens to our computers. With having several types of options available, the amount of content can be overwhelming and easily inundate even the most avid consumer. The ability to understand if information is fraudulent or real is becoming ever more difficult to immediately recognize. This month is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month and there are so many fraudulent scams that we all must stay alert against. I invite everyone to utilize the tools from the Better Business Bureau at&nbsp;&nbsp;to review questionable product advertisements and websites. Additionally, if you do unfortunately fall victim to an online scam, you can easily report that information here as well. Everyone should practice the same amount, if not more, awareness online for products and companies as you would if you walked into a store to buy a product. There have been safeguards implemented on social media platforms and unsolicited phone calls have decreased over the years, but the ability to protect your identity and defend yourself from getting scammed continues to get more difficult as corrupt individuals adapt to the consumer. At the end of the day, you ultimately are in control by what ads you click on, websites to visit, or phone calls to call-back. Asking questions and always double-checking the legitimacy of any new online interaction or entity is the best practice to follow. Read more in my weekly column here.&nbsp;  BEN E. KEITH FOODS&nbsp;EXPANSION IN COFFEE COUNTY  Earlier this month, Ben E. Keith Foods&nbsp;officially broke ground on a new $100 million distribution center in New Brockton, creating 80 jobs. I&#8217;m grateful and proud they've chosen to invest in Alabama's Second District, and I am looking forward to their continued growth and success. THE WEEK AHEAD  The House plans to take action again regarding Turkey's aggression in Syria. Additionally, we are watching for potential action in the Senate this week as they move toward funding the government.&nbsp;Remember that you can follow along with the latest on my Facebook page and Twitter feed.&nbsp;  It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
