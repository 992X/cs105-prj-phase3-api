As I said on the House floor, I am an equal to every one of my male colleagues in Congress until I walk out the door and down the steps of the Capitol. Then I am relegated to second-class status because women are not recognized in the Constitution as fully equal to men under the law. Thursday&#8217;s vote on H.J.Res.79, my resolution to facilitate ratification of the ERA, was a vote for equality, the American dream, and that more perfect union. I am proud of House Democrats, and five of our Republican colleagues,&nbsp;who&nbsp;joined me in championing&nbsp;the fight for women&#8217;s rights and greater equality. House Democrats also continued our work to protect our environment and natural spaces with a sweeping wilderness protection bill, and we voted to establish the first museum in the United States dedicated to the celebration and recognition of women&#8217;s history. We also turned the spotlight on threats to our nation with the&nbsp;Military Personnel Committee hearing that I chaired and that focused on the rise of white supremacy in our military, the House Armed Services Committee hearing on the malign actions of foreign adversaries including Russia and China, and my work to expose and eradicate the corrosive effects of sexual assault on our brave servicemembers &#8211; which threatens unit cohesion and military readiness. I was proud to introduce a resolution with Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA)&nbsp;to establish an international anti-corruption court&nbsp;to address the impact that corruption has on&nbsp;human rights worldwide and the challenge of holding kleptocrats accountable for their crimes, and much more as you will read below. I am looking forward&nbsp;to being home in the 14th District this coming week. Then it&#8217;s back to Washington, DC the week of February 24th, and a return of Jackie&#8217;s DC Dashboard, so be sure to keep an eye out for the next update.                   As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

By 1982, 35 states out of the required 38 states voted to ratify the amendment. In the past three years, grassroots campaigns have successfully secured the final ratification votes in Nevada, Illinois, and most recently, Virginia. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel recently put out a legal opinion that the current ERA push is dead and that Congress lacks the authority to revive it. The Archivist, who is responsible for certifying amendments to the Constitution once ratified by three-fourths of the states, has decided to follow DOJ&#8217;s guidance even though Article V makes clear the Executive has no role in the Constitutional amendment process. Our vote to eliminate the arbitrary deadline brings us closer to placing this important guarantee of women&#8217;s equality in our founding document. It is now up to the Senate to follow suit and vote on companion legislation by Senators Murkowski and Cardin, and the Archivist to move forward with certifying the ERA.  Voted for Sweeping Wilderness Bill This week, the House took a major step toward protecting our public lands by voting to designate almost 1.4 million acres of land as wilderness and adding 1,000 river miles to the National Wild and Scenic River Systems. H.R. 2546, the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act, would preserve natural spaces in California, Colorado, and Washington for generations to come by protecting them from logging, mining, drilling, and new construction. It would also improve recreational access for underserved communities, safeguard ancestral homelands and tribal access, and boost local economies. Despite the bipartisan House vote, the Senate Majority Mitch McConnell is likely to relegate this critically-needed bill to his legislative graveyard. President Trump has also threatened to veto this legislation if it reaches his desk. But this fight is far from over. Our public lands are our most important natural heritage and an important tool in the fight against climate change. House Democrats will continue to push for wilderness and environmental protections as Americans across the continue to demand action this election year. Voted to Create a Smithsonian Women&#8217;s History Museum On Tuesday, House Democrats passed H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women&#8217;s History Museum Act. This bipartisan legislation would establish a Smithsonian museum dedicated to women&#8217;s history on the National Mall. Currently, we do not have a comprehensive museum in America documenting women&#8217;s history. Without it, women&#8217;s contributions to the nation are too often forgotten and could be lost as distant and forgotten memories. The stories of women in this country are too integral to our history to push aside. I was proud to vote for this historic legislation and urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass it so that we can get to work building this museum!    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Chaired MILPERS Hearing on White Supremacists in the Military  There are several warning signs that these efforts have found success. Recent high-profile examples include a Marine attending the 2017 Charlottesville rally, a Coast Guard officer arrested with a cache of weapons, and a West Point graduate espousing hate on social media. It seems that the military is not only not taking this threat seriously enough, it also lacks the tools it needs and has failed to dedicate sufficient resources to fighting this threat. At the hearing, we discussed necessary improvements to the accessions process, how we investigate and punish white supremacist activity in the forces, and how we report and track these individuals after they have been expelled from the military. I look forward to an update from military leadership soon on the progress that they will make in focusing on this issue with the seriousness and commitment that it demands. You can watch the hearing here.  House Armed Services Committee Hearing on Threats Posed by Russia and China This week, I attended the House Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department&#8217;s role in our national efforts to address the threats and challenges posed by Russia and China&#8212;two formidable countries that do not share our values. The DoD is focused on ensuring that the United States is ready to compete with those countries militarily, but at the hearing we discussed the importance of addressing less traditional acts of aggression, such as propaganda operations, cyber-attacks, and predatory economic practices. Countering these threats will require a comprehensive strategy across our government, executed in partnership with our allies.  Spoke on a Panel about Military Sexual Assault&nbsp; On Wednesday night, I attended Heroine, a one-woman show about a female soldier performed at the beautiful Kennedy Center. The play, which is based on a real story, describes a woman&#8217;s struggle with addiction, depression, and suicide after being raped by soldiers in her unit. I was deeply impressed by how the performance conveyed the horror of military sexual assault and lasting pains with which survivors must wrestle. After the play, I sat on a panel with military justice experts to discuss our ongoing efforts to address this issue. As the Chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, I have made eradicating military sexual violence a top priority because our military cannot succeed while battling this scourge within its ranks.&nbsp;    Meetings with Jackie Meeting with Local Veterans Affairs Department Union On Wednesday, I met with leaders of AFGE Local 2110, the union that represents workers at our local VA hospital and clinic. We discussed our ongoing efforts to improve VA locality pay to offset the high cost of living in our area and help the VA recruit and retain staff. The VA representatives also shared the way that the Trump Administration&#8217;s anti-union actions have constrained their ability to operate. I remain committed to helping AFGE as it fights for its members to receive a living wage and fair representation.  Met with Northern California Special Olympics Delegation  Met with the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District On Wednesday I met with representatives of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District (GGBHTD) to discuss opportunities for supporting San Francisco&#8217;s infrastructure needs. The District shared their plans for upcoming federal grant opportunities, and I look forward to lending my support to their work. We discussed the District&#8217;s concerns around the lack of federal funding to California for critical infrastructure needs, such as seismic retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge and expansion of the ferry boat system. I share many of their concerns, especially given President Trump&#8217;s vindictive attitude toward California.  The GGBHTD also provided updates on important projects and policies such as drone restrictions over the bridge, construction of the suicide net, and new safety measures for the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is an icon of the Bay Area as well as a vital piece of infrastructure for the region. I remain committed to supporting GGBHT and the needs of all Bay Area residents.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District  Here are some issues raised this week:   99 constituents expressed support for H.R. 230, the Ban Toxic Pesticides Act of 2019. I am a cosponsor of this crucial piece of legislation that would ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and prohibit any future registration of the pesticide. Please know that I will always fight to protect public health and safety, and ensure that our water, produce, and environment is safe from toxic chemicals. 87 constituents expressed concern with fracking.&nbsp; Like you, I am deeply concerned about the effect of fracking on water sources. I take regulation of hydraulic fracturing seriously and will fight to protect the health and safety of all Americans. I am also deeply committed to supporting clean technology innovation, including solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, advanced biofuels, and other renewable energy sources 27 constituents expressed support for our public lands. Our landscapes and national parks are treasures that must be preserved for future generations. I am proud to have been named a \"Friend of the National Parks,\" and I am committed to conserving our natural heritage.

Morgan Griffith","address":"Griffith.News@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-14","subject":"No Road Back for the ERA","body":"No Road Back for the ERA There are few things from 1972 that you could just pick up and dust off for use today. Clothes would be out of fashion if they even fit, cars would need plenty of maintenance and care to be driven, and disco music had not even made its way onto the music charts. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) passed Congress in that year! It proposes a solution to a problem that existed prior to 1972 and was being resolved with good legislation at the federal and state levels. For an amendment to pass, the United States Constitution requires the approval of two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, followed by ratification in three-fourths of the states. It is not supposed to be an easy process, and only 27 amendments have been added since the Constitutions adoption. The ERA included a seven-year deadline for ratification. By the time it arrived in 1979, 31 states had ratified the ERA. Four others had ratified it but rescinded their ratifications by the deadline. By no measure had the required 38 states ratified the ERA. Congress then passed an extension to 1982, although the extension only passed by a simple majority rather than the two-thirds vote required for constitutional amendments, rendering the extension legally very suspect. A federal district court in Idaho found the extension invalid in 1981. In any event, no more states ratified the ERA by the 1982 deadline. The Supreme Court that year declared a lawsuit about the extension moot because the amendment had failed. The House of Representatives in 1983 tried to pass a new Equal Rights Amendment, another concession that the ratification process begun in 1972 was dead, but that new ERA did not attain the required two-thirds vote. You dont have to go back almost four decades to find Supreme Court justices who think the ERA is dead. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ERA supporter, said on February 10, 2020, Id like it to start over, noting the controversy with states adopting it late and others rescinding it before ratification. Nevertheless, supporters of the ERA are plowing ahead. Virginias new Democrat majority in the General Assembly spent valuable legislative time on ratification, and the Democrat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution by simple majority to remove the deadline. ERA proponents cite the 27th Amendment, which prohibited congressional pay raises from taking effect before an election of representatives had intervened. This amendment was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights in 1789 and only ratified in 1992, but unlike the ERA, it never had a deadline. Other amendments, such as the Eighteenth Amendment imposing Prohibition, did include a deadline but were ratified in time. In light of these facts, the recent activity regarding the ERA is little more than a sideshow. But what of Justice Ginsburgs suggestion that supporters of the amendment start over? The country is in a different place than it was in 1972, when the ERA passed Congress. It is certainly in a different place than it was in 1943, when the text was first introduced, or 1923, when the original ERA was proposed. I am sympathetic to those who advocated the amendment prior to 1972. In the 1960s, my mother sought a loan for our house on Broad Street in Salem. The house I grew up in was at risk of being lost. At the time, she was ineligible because she was a divorced woman. A divorced man earning the same would have had no problem. That was wrong. Fortunately, a sympathetic loan officer checked the box that she was widowed, thus making her eligible. By the 1970s, when she applied for a loan for a house on Main Street, that legal barrier had been eliminated by good legislation without the need for a constitutional amendment. In just a few years, the situation had changed and my mother was treated more fairly. ERA supporters overlook our ability to make progress, whether by specific legal changes, cultural shifts, or other means apart from the drastic step of amending the Constitution. Any injustices that exist today should be remedied by legislation. The ERA is a blunt instrument. Its very broadness could lead to applications that are far from promoting equality. For instance, some states that have included ERAs in their constitutions have been forced to support abortion. Courts could very well force the same outcome at the federal level. Legally, the ERA has been long dead, and it should not be resurrected. If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.

Every time I step on the House floor, I&#8217;m focused on legislation that will help our district - whether that&#8217;s lowering out of pocket health care costs or making sure every student gets a quality education. No matter what is happening in Washington, I won&#8217;t lose sight of the issues we face back home.&nbsp; I was especially lucky to introduce Kathy Zeman to the House Agriculture Committee earlier this week. Kathy farms in Rice County and she came to Washington to testify in support of the Local Agricultural Markets Program which promotes farmers&#8217; markets around the country.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Expanding Higher Ed Opportunities  On Tuesday, I spoke with Minnesota State about how we can expand higher ed opportunities for our students. If education isn&#8217;t affordable, it&#8217;s not accessible.   &nbsp;     Improving Rural Health CareRight now, there are insufficient health care resources in our rural communities. Wednesday, I met with folks from the Minnesota Department of Health to talk about the unique healthcare challenges facing rural patients and providers.       Advocating for Minnesota River Funding&nbsp;This week, I sat down with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and the Waterways Council to discuss the importance of the Minnesota River Dredging project in keeping the river fully operational. The river transports about 4 million tons annually, worth more than $362 Million in economic value.   &nbsp;     Pushing for Ratification of the ERA:&nbsp;Equal rights for women should not have a deadline. In fact, it&#8217;s long past time. That&#8217;s why I voted to remove the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment on Thursday.  Protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social SecurityThe President&#8217;s budget proposes cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I&#8217;ll never stand for that. Watch my video about these cuts here.&nbsp;  Supporting the Special OlympicsThis week was Special Olympics Hill Day! It was great meeting with our Minnesota delegation about empowering folks with different abilities.       Meeting Rescue PuppiesThursday, I stopped by the ASPCA Paws for Love pet adoption event to give out some belly rubs.   &nbsp;     Funding Recreational TrailsThis week, I introduced the Recreational Trails Full Funding Act of 2020 with Rep. Welch to make sure folks have quality trails to enjoy Minnesota&#8217;s four seasons for hiking, cross country skiing and taking their ATV&#8217;s out. Not only will this bill invest in these opportunities right now, but it also makes sure future generations of Minnesotans and visitors can experience the beauty of the Minnesota River Valley and our well-traveled trails from Zumbrota to Cottage Grove.&nbsp;  Upcoming Event:Excited to announce my February town hall!

It was a very eventful week and I'm excited to tell you about what we accomplished. Here are some highlights:   I was the Grand Marshall for the Ninth Annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade I toured the Indian River Lagoon to see living shorelines and learn more about preserving our environment I attended the signing of the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act by President Trump at the White House I spoke on the House floor in recognition of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and her contributions to our community and country  CELEBRATING OUR RACING HISTORY: This weekend I had the honor of serving as the Grand Marshall of this year&#8217;s Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade! Since the 1920s, Daytona Beach has been the home of&nbsp;NASCAR, with drivers setting records racing down our beach to the famous North Turn and A1A. This race is an important part of our community&#8217;s history and it&#8217;s always one of my favorite events every year!    Serving as Grand Marshall at the 9th annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade  CONSERVING OUR SHORELINE:&nbsp;Our beautiful and natural shorelines can co-exist with development when done correctly. Living shorelines and mangroves are important for our communities because they are the best natural barriers against storm surges. Estuaries and mangroves are also important to commercial fisherman. Around 80 percent of them rely on estuaries and mangroves for spawning.&nbsp;I enjoyed touring our local living shorelines to learn more about how conservancies bring free market, volunteering and community based solutions to our community. It's important we maintain our living shorelines to help keep Florida resilient.&nbsp;    Views of our Indian River Lagoon living shoreline  SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS: This week, I went to the White House to see President Trump sign another bill supporting our veterans into law &#8212; and this time, it was a bill I co-sponsored! The&nbsp;Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act&nbsp;supports our veterans, helping them find opportunities for jobs in STEM fields when they return to civilian life. I was glad&nbsp;to work on this bill with two fellow Florida congressmen, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Neal Dunn, and I was proud to be there as the President signed it into law!    President Trump signing the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act into law RECOGNIZING SERVANT LEADERSHIP: I can't think of anyone better to highlight great servant leadership in our community and our country this Black History Month than our district's very own Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. Bethune founded and was President of the all African-American girls school in Daytona Beach, which later became&nbsp;Bethune&#8211;Cookman University.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Homeland Security for Children Act (), the DHS Acquisition Reform Act of 2019 (), the providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2546) to designate certain lands in the State of Colorado as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes; providing for consideration of the joint resolution () removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment; and for other purposes. (), the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act (), the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act (), and the removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment (). Budget season has officially begun. Earlier this week, I received the President&#8217;s budget request for Fiscal Year 2021. While Congress holds the Article I powers of the Constitution, or the &#8220;power of the purse,&#8221; the President&#8217;s budget outlines his vision for the nation.&nbsp;The release of the President&#8217;s budget request historically kicks off the congressional budget process in both the House and the Senate. It serves as a starting point for lawmakers to make spending decisions and analyze the economic outlook for the coming year. The framework of the budget process can be divided up into :   President submits the budget to Congress House and Senate mark up and pass budget House and Senate conference the budget resolution Consideration and passage of Appropriations bills Consideration of reconciliation/authorization Start of new Fiscal Year (October 1st)   I applaud President Trump for putting forward a budget proposal. That&#8217;s more than we can say for the People&#8217;s House, where, for the second straight year, the Democrat majority has failed to produce a budget. That&#8217;s not leadership.  This is interesting to me because, on the House Budget Committee majority&#8217;s website, there is a section titled &#8220;Responsibility.&#8221; The first sentence in this section reads, &#8220;The Committee&#8217;s chief responsibility is to draft an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that provides a congressional framework for spending and revenue levels, the federal surplus or deficit, and public debt.&#8221;  In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done. Yet, here in the House, in the greatest country in the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget. Simply put, a failure to budget is a failure to govern.  We must start doing our job to put our country on a sustainable, responsible fiscal path. This is our duty to the American people, not promoting budget-busting policies, including Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, that will leave future generations saddled with the consequences of House Democrats&#8217; eagerness to spend with no way to pay. It&#8217;s time for Democrats to stop punting one of our most basic responsibilities in Congress. I&#8217;m ready for them to join us at the table to do the difficult work.  While we can&#8217;t analyze the Democrats&#8217; budget &#8211; because they won&#8217;t put one forth &#8211; the House Budget Committee did hold a hearing on the President&#8217;s FY 2021 budget proposal with&nbsp;OMB&nbsp;Acting Director Russell Vought. As we discussed, the proposal seeks to balance our fiscal constraints with the need to fund the priorities of the country, including national defense. The President&#8217;s budget includes deficit reduction measures, specifically $4.6 trillion between 2021-2030. This is a strong start, but more work remains to be done to put our country on a solid fiscal path. Moving forward, it is imperative that we work together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to advance a budget that funds our nation&#8217;s important priorities while acknowledging our very real fiscal challenges. You can read my full opening remarks .  MEETINGS  In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! It was a pleasure to meet with Keturah Finch and Tanner Arnwine of Bentonville to talk about neurofibromatosis&nbsp;(NF), a genetic, tumor-generating disorder. We discussed research through the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) and the National Institutes of Health, as well as its value to civilians, warfighters, and veterans suffering from&nbsp;NF. Novel research has led to a new era of medical breakthroughs for a variety of illnesses, but there is still much more work to be done across many fields. We must continue to make smart investments that build our pipeline of science, research, and medical discovery. The next morning, I invited my Republican House Budget Committee colleagues to join me at the Office of Budget and Management to hear more about the President&#8217;s recently released budget proposal, as well as fiscal priorities of the White House. As I mentioned earlier, I appreciate the Administration for drafting a budget. Congress should be doing the same thing, but House Democrats have refused to put forth a proposal yet again. In the real world, everyday Americans and Arkansans are held accountable for their income, expenses, and savings. Main Street job creators and business leaders are held accountable for demonstrating fiscal restraint, for making tough choices, and for setting priorities. Congress should not be any different. But in the House, Democrats are refusing to put forth the very document that tells us what we need to know about how much we&#8217;re spending, what we&#8217;re raising in revenue, and the impact of our deficits and debt on our economy and the nation. The American people deserve better.  Representatives from NorthWest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) were in Washington, and I had the opportunity to hear some important school and curriculum updates. We talked about enhancing Career and Technical Education (CTE), the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act &#8211; which I voted for &#8211; and the National Science Foundation&#8217;s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. NWACC just received an ATE grant for a project that will create a Technical Certificate in Integrated Design to help expand the skilled technical workforce, especially in construction fields and engineering design. NWACC is helping prepare our students for the jobs of today and the future, and I appreciate their dedication to providing quality education and opportunities in the Third District. I thank Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson, Dr. Ricky Tompkins, Jim Hall, Rachel Harris, and DeAnne Witherspoon for their time and work!  I then met with the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police. I always appreciate meeting with our law enforcement officers and hearing more about their work to protect and serve our communities. We discussed many issues, including The Protect and Serve Act (HR 1325). I&#8217;m a cosponsor of this legislation, which creates new federal penalties for individuals who deliberately attack or attempt to cause significant bodily injury to any law enforcement officer. This bill aims to deter attacks against police officers who have increasingly been targeted and face higher levels of hostility because of the uniform they wear. I&#8217;m extremely thankful for the work of the men and women who wear the badge each day!  My next meeting was with the Enlisted Association of the Arkansas National Guard. It was wonderful to sit down with Arkansas National Guard members from Fort Smith and other parts of the state to talk about their work, duties, and programs that support their efforts. We also had a productive discussion on the National Guard&#8217;s role going forward in the Space and Cyber domains. The Arkansas Air National Guard has both Space and Cyber missions. As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas Army&nbsp;National Guard, I salute their service and thank them for their commitment to the Natural State and our nation! I then welcomed Dr. John Lorsch, Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, to my office to speak about the Institutional Development Award (IDea) program and its impact on Arkansas. Our conversations focused on the NIH&#8217;s research and biomedical investments within the Natural State.  I wrapped up the day at the National Guard Association, where I joined National Guard members from across the country to talk about defense efforts, legislative advocacy, and my work on the House Budget Committee. I shared stories about my time in uniform, as well as my perspectives on appropriations work in Congress. I talked about the constrained resource environment we face, and how growing mandatory spending is squeezing the portion of discretionary funding available for national priorities. The Guard brings great value to the fight, and it was my honor to talk to this great group and answer questions.  The next morning, I met with Dan Hendrix, President and CEO of the World Trade Center Arkansas. I appreciated an update on their work, economic development in the community, small business grants, and the impact of recent trade deals on the state. Arkansas is a state of opportunity, and the World Trade Center Arkansas is a pivotal resource that has supported bilateral trade services, global connections, and export development programs for local businesses.  Our region is full of opportunity, and it was great to speak with students from the Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program. FLEX students spend an academic year in the U.S. living with a volunteer host family and attending high school. The students, who are from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are currently living and going to school in Russellville and Springdale! They said that they have learned a lot during their time living and studying in the region &#8211; and that they love the sense of community in Arkansas! &nbsp;  Modernized infrastructure is vital to keeping our communities economically competitive and strong. It was great to wrap up my week in Washington with Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.&nbsp;We had very productive conversations on rural infrastructure grants, local projects like I-49 and regional airport improvements, and budget and appropriations.&nbsp;We also highlighted the importance of addressing U.S. infrastructure needs using smart and effective methods that provide results and maximize our resources. Today, I also want to wish everyone &#8211; especially my wonderful wife, Terri &#8211; a Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day! I'm grateful that my office was able to present some special valentines to residents at Methodist Village Senior Living in Fort Smith. Spreading some cheer and happiness is what this day is all about! I&#8217;m looking forward to being back in the district and traveling the Natural State next week. Wishing everyone a Happy Presidents&#8217;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;on Monday! Let us reflect and honor the leaders who've held our nation's highest office to serve the American people. By swearing an oath to &#8220;preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,&#8221; they each answered the call to lead our great country throughout history. From George Washington to Donald Trump, Happy Presidents' Day to all our leaders &#8211; past and present!

The impeachment trial is both a symptom of our times and another example of our division. At the beginning of our nation, we did not have an impeachment inquiry of a president for almost 100 years with the partisan impeachment of Andrew Johnson. After more than 100 years, another impeachment inquiry was conducted when the House began a formal impeachment inquiry into President Nixon in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410-4. Within a period of weeks, President Nixon resigned before he was formally impeached. Then, just over two decades later, President Clinton was impeached by the House, on another mostly partisan vote leading to a partisan acquittal in the Senate.&nbsp;  This season of our history and has been referred to as the Age of Investigations and the Age of Impeachment. We have had multiple special counsels since 1974 over multiple topics. This is more than just oversight; it has been a unique time in American history when the politics of the moment have driven rapid calls for investigation and impeachment. Over the past three years, the House of Representatives has voted four times to open an impeachment inquiry: once in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019. Only the second vote in 2019 actually passed and began a formal inquiry.&nbsp;  The Mueller investigation that consumed most of 2018 and 2019 answered many questions about Russian attacks on our voting systems&#8212;though no votes were changed&#8212;but it was also a $32 million investigation that took more than two years of America&#8217;s attention. For the last four months the country has been consumed with impeachment hearings and investigations. The first rumors of issues with Ukraine arose August 28 when Politico published a story about US foreign aid being slow-walked for Ukraine, and then on September 18 when The&nbsp;Washington Post published a story about a whistleblower report that claimed President Trump pressured an unnamed foreign head of state to do an investigation for his campaign.&nbsp;  Within days of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Washington Post story on September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House would begin hearings to impeach the President, which led to the formal House vote to open the impeachment inquiry on October 31 and then a vote to impeach the President on December 18th. But after the partisan vote to impeach the President, Speaker Pelosi held the articles of impeachment for a month before turning them over to the Senate, which began the formal trial of the President of the United States on January 16, 2020. After hearing hours of arguments from both House Managers and the President&#8217;s legal defense team and Senators asking 180 questions to both sides, the trial concluded February 5, 2020. Key Dates to Know&nbsp;   April 21, 2019 - President Zelensky is elected President of Ukraine. May 21 - President Zelensky sworn in. After the ceremony, President Zelensky abolishes Parliament and calls for quick (snap) elections on July 21. July 21 &#8211; Ukrainian Parliamentary elections. President Zelensky&#8217;s party wins a huge majority. July 25 - President Trump calls President Zelensky to congratulate him and his party.

August 26 - The Inspector General for the Intelligence Community declares the whistleblower report &#8220;an urgent matter&#8221; and asks for its release within seven days. The Justice Department looks over the report and notes that though it was written by a person in the intelligence community, it is not related to intelligence matters, so it does not fall within the Inspector General&#8217;s jurisdiction and it is forwarded on to the Department of Justice for review.&nbsp; August 28 - Politico publishes a story that the annual military aid for Ukraine is currently being slow-walked. September 9 - The Inspector General contacts the House Intelligence Committee to let them know that he has not been able to release the whistleblower report to their committee. September 13 - The House Intelligence Committee subpoenas the whistleblower report.

December 18 - The House votes to impeach the President with two articles&#8212;Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress January 15 - Speaker Pelosi releases the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate January 16 - Senate trial on impeachment begins. February 5 - Senate trial concludes with acquittal on both articles.  Important Context of What Was Happening in Ukraine  Ukraine became independent in 1991 when it broke away from the Soviet Union, but the Ukrainians have faced constant pressure from Russia ever since. In 2014 Ukraine forced out its pro-Russia president, and Moscow retaliated by taking over Crimea (and stealing the Ukrainian Navy), then rolling tanks into eastern Ukraine and taking all of eastern Ukraine by force. Russian and Ukrainian troops continue to fight every day in eastern Ukraine.&nbsp;  The people of Ukraine face an aggressive Russia on the east and pervasive Soviet era corruption throughout the government and the business community. President Trump met the previous President of Ukraine in 2017 to talk about other countries helping Ukraine with greater military support funds and to ask how Ukraine could address corruption on a wider scale. The two Presidents also spoke about lethal aid (allowing the Ukrainians to buy sniper rifles, anti-tank javelin missiles, and other lethal supplies) to help them fight the invading Russians. The US also started sending a couple hundred American troops to train Ukrainian soldiers in the far west of Ukraine.&nbsp;  Ukrainian&nbsp;President Zelensky  On April 21, 2019, President Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected as the new President of Ukraine. He was a sitcom actor/comedian who had no political experience, but was well known for his television show in which he played the part of a corruption-fighting teacher who was elected as President of Ukraine. His television popularity helped him win the election, but when he was sworn in on May 21, he was relatively unknown to most of the world.&nbsp;  On the same day as his inauguration, May 21, President Zelensky abolished Parliament and called for snap elections to put his party in power. With a new president in place and parliamentary elections in Ukraine coming, starting in June of 2019, the President ordered foreign aid to Ukraine to be held until the end of the fiscal year, but agencies were informed that they should do all the preliminary work needed before the aid was sent, so it would be ready to release at a moment&#8217;s notice. The leadership in Ukraine was not notified that there was a hold on their foreign aid.&nbsp;  The new Parliament was elected on July 21, and President Zelensky&#8217;s party won by a landslide. By mid-August, the new Parliament was working on anti-corruption efforts and trying to establish a High Court on Corruption, which they put in place September 5, 2019. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the early days of the new administration, but by mid August there was clear evidence of actual change in a country that desperately needed a new direction from its corrupt past.&nbsp;  President Trump&#8217;s Phone Call to President Zelensky  On July 25, when President Trump called President Zelensky, the President congratulated President Zelensky for the big win in Parliament and talked about &#8220;burden-sharing&#8221; (other nations also paying their share of support for Ukraine). The two presidents talked about their disapproval of the previous ambassadors to each other&#8217;s countries. But instead of following all the staff preparation notes written by Lt. Col Vindman, the National Security Council staffer assigned to Ukraine, and just talking about &#8220;corruption&#8221; in general, the President brought up a question about Ukraine and the 2016 election interference, which I will note below. President Zelensky also brought up to President Trump that his staff was planning to meet with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, in the coming days, which led to a conversation about Joe Biden and the firing of the previous prosecutor in Ukraine.&nbsp;  After the call, Lt. Col Vindman contacted an attorney at the National Security Council to express his &#8220;policy concerns&#8221; about the call. It is interesting to note that Lt. Col. Vindman&#8217;s boss, Tim Morrison, was also on the call, but he did not see any problems or concerns with the call according to his own testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. Within a month a whistleblower filed a report about the call, saying he heard about the call second-hand and was concerned about the implications of a conversation about elections on a head-of-state call. To keep the July 25th call in context with other news, the day before it took place&#8212;July 24&#8212;Robert Mueller had testified before Congress as the last official act to close down the two-and-a-half-year Mueller investigation and clear the President and his campaign team of any further accusation of election interference.&nbsp;  During the impeachment trial in the Senate, the House Managers repeated over and over that the President was planning to cheat &#8220;again&#8221; on the next election, but the final conclusion of the Mueller Report was &#8220;ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the (Trump) Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.&#8221;&nbsp;  This is especially notable, because for years a rumor circulated that Ukraine was part of the 2016 election interference and that someone in Ukraine was hiding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server that was hacked by the Russians in 2016. As the conspiracy theory goes, it was actually the Ukrainians that hacked the DNC, not the Russians. This is the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory that President Trump asked President Zelensky to help solve during the call.&nbsp;  Agencies of the US Intelligence Community have stated over and over that they did not believe that Ukraine was involved in the Russian election interference from 2016. I personally agree with the Intelligence Community assessment. But Rudy Giuliani, and multiple others around President Trump believed there was a secret plan in 2016 to hurt President Trump&#8217;s election from Ukraine. This accusation was amplified by bits of truth, including that the Ukrainian Ambassador to the US wrote an editorial in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 right before the election, and several other Ukrainian officials publicly spoke out against candidate Trump in 2016.&nbsp;  There is nothing illegal about a foreign nation speaking out for or against a presidential candidate, whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in 2016, or anyone else in the future. It may not be wise to take sides before an election, but it is not illegal. Just because some Ukrainian officials took sides, does not mean that the whole Ukrainian government worked on a cyberattack on our elections. But since this rumor had persisted, and it was a new administration now in Ukraine, President Trump asked President Zelensky to help clear up the facts if he could. That is certainly not illegal or improper, and it is certainly not something that could help the President in the 2020 election, especially since the 2016 Russian election accusation had just been closed the day before.&nbsp; &nbsp; The 2016 &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory is the issue that President Trump asked President Zelensky to &#8220;do us a favor&#8221; about, not the Biden&#8217;s or Burisma. During the July 25 call after the question about &#8220;Crowdstrike,&#8221; President Zelensky mentioned to President Trump that one of his advisers would be meeting with Rudy Giuliani soon. Then, President Trump affirmed that meeting and encouraged them to talk about the Biden investigation and the firing of the Ukrainian Prosecutor.&nbsp;  That may seem out of the blue, but in Washington, DC, that week, the city was buzzing about a Washington Post article that had been written three days before (July 22, 2019) detailing Hunter Biden&#8217;s giant salary ($83,000 per month) for doing essentially nothing for a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company and how it undercut Vice President Biden&#8217;s message on corruption.&nbsp;  It is important to get the context of that week to understand the context of the phone call that day. I have no doubt that the story was just as big of news in Kiev, Ukraine as it was in Washington, DC, that week. President Trump&#8217;s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had been in and out of Ukraine since November 2018, meeting with government officials and trying to find out more about the &#8220;Crowdstrike&#8221; theory or any other Ukrainian connection to the 2016 election. During that time Rudy Giuliani met several former prosecutors from Ukraine who blamed their departure on Vice President Biden. It is clear that Rudy Giuliani was working to gain information about both of these issues in his capacity as President Trump&#8217;s private attorney.&nbsp;  It is not criminal for Rudy Giuliani to work on opposition research for a presidential campaign or to work on behalf of his client to clear his name from any issues related to the 2016 campaign, which he had done since November 2018. Some have stated that since this was &#8220;foreign information,&#8221; it is illegal. That is absolutely not true. In fact, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee in 2016 paid a British citizen, Christopher Steele, to work his contacts in Russia to create the now debunked &#8220;Steele Dossier&#8221; which the FBI used to open its investigation into President Trump, leading directly to the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller. That &#8220;Dossier&#8221; was opposition research done in Russia by a British citizen, paid for by the Clinton campaign team. Their opposition research was not illegal, but the use and abuse of that document by the FBI to start an investigation was certainly inappropriate and is most likely illegal. But, the FBI warrant issue is still being investigated by the ongoing Durham probe.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, when President Zelensky brought up the issue of Rudy Giuliani and President Trump replied to his statement. You can argue that President Trump should not have discussed the issue with President Zelensky when he brought it up, but it is certainly not illegal or impeachable to talk about it, especially when there are serious questions about Hunter Biden&#8217;s work with Burisma. That is not a conservative conspiracy theory; the issue of Hunter Biden&#8217;s employment in Ukraine was a problem for years at the State Department. It had been raised to Vice President Biden when he was still in office. Every State Department official interviewed for the Trump impeachment investigation noted that at best it was a clear conflict of interest and it was the center of a huge story on corruption in the Washington Post on July 22, 2019. It had the appearance of high-level corruption by using a well-placed family member on the board of a known corrupt gas company in Ukraine to shelter it from prosecutors. Hunter Biden had only resigned from the Burisma board a few months before the July 25 phone call, just prior to when his dad announced his run for the Presidency in 2019.&nbsp;  After the July 25 phone call, Attorney General Barr did not have any follow up meetings or calls with Ukrainian officials. Rudy Giuliani did have additional conversations with Ukrainian officials, which are legal to do since he is a private attorney representing the President.&nbsp;  Text of July 25, 2019 Phone Call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky:  The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.  President Zelensky: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.   The President: (laughter) That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.  President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us and in that.   The President: Well it is very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she &#183;doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.  President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.  The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.  President Zelensky: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.. That I can assure you.   The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.  President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.  The President: Well, she's going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people.  President Zelensky: I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for your support.  The President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work that out. I look forward to seeing you.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine.  The President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.   President Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. President.   The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.  President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.   &nbsp;  Based on a whistleblower report about the July 25 call, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the report on September 13 and started its impeachment inquiry on September 24.&nbsp;  Senate Trial  House Managers&#8217; Case for Impeachment&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, House Managers stated their belief that the President had carried out a &#8220;scheme to cheat in the 2020 election&#8221; by withholding financial aid to Ukraine and withholding a White House meeting with the new President of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine announcing it would investigate Joe Biden, Burisma, and 2016 election interference.  Let's discuss the facts of both.&nbsp;  White House Meeting&nbsp;  There is no question that President Trump had offered a White House meeting to President Zelensky three times: once in May on a phone call after President Zelensky won his election, once in June in a letter, and finally in the July 25th call after President Zelensky&#8217;s party won the parliamentary elections. But Tim Morrison (a State Department official called as a witness by the House) also testified that they were working on heads-of-state meetings with twelve other heads of state during that same time period. Many nations were trying to line up meetings in the White House during the summer of 2019.&nbsp;  During the July 25 call, President Zelensky offered to instead move their meeting from a White House meeting to a face-to-face meeting in Warsaw, Poland, when they would both be there on September 1, 2019. The Presidents agreed, and planning began on the meeting in August. By August 22, the meeting planning was in full swing as noted by emails in the House hearing&#8217;s evidence. However, Hurricane Dorian slammed into the US in the hours leading up to the September 1 meeting, causing a last-minute shift to the Vice President traveling to Poland so the President could stay in the US to monitor hurricane relief.&nbsp;  We know that Vice President Pence met face-to-face with President Zelensky, and they spoke about other nations paying their fair share to help Ukraine and the issue of corruption across Ukraine. We know from the preparation materials and the meeting notes themselves that during the meeting the Vice President did not bring up or discuss the issue of Burisma, Joe Biden, or any other campaign conversation with President Zelensky.&nbsp;  The White House found the next available time when President Trump and President Zelensky would both be in the same place at the same time to set up a face-to-face meeting: September 25 at the UN Assembly in New York. That meeting was set up, and it took place as scheduled.&nbsp;  In the Senate impeachment trial, the House managers maintained that only a White House meeting was sufficient and that it was being withheld, but the facts show that President Zelensky himself floated the idea of a meeting in Poland and that the meeting was not barred or withheld.&nbsp;  In the early months of President Zelensky&#8217;s term, there was a great deal of concern about him, his staff, and his plans because he was an unknown political figure. Until more was known about him, it was entirely appropriate to show caution in coordinating a meeting, but once his nationwide anti-corruption efforts began in August, it was clear that face-to-face meetings were planned and carried out.&nbsp;  There was no withholding of a face-to-face meeting with President Trump and President Zelensky. There cannot be a quid pro quo if the meeting was not withheld from Ukrainian officials.&nbsp;  Foreign Aid to Ukraine  The House Managers claimed that there was a secret plot to &#8220;extort&#8221; or &#8220;bribe&#8221; the leadership of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden in exchange for around $400 million of US aid. The aid was State Department and foreign military aid that had been provided for the past four years, since Ukraine had been in a war with Russia.&nbsp;  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its occupation of Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the US started sending aid to help the Ukrainian government. Congress allowed lethal and non-lethal aid to support Ukraine, but during the previous administration, only non-lethal aid was sent. Under President Trump&#8217;s administration, it was determined that the United States would give the leadership of Ukraine lethal aid to help them fight off Russian tanks, which was President Zelensky&#8217;s reference to &#8220;javelins&#8221; in the July 25th phone call and his gratitude to President Trump for allowing those tank killing rockets to flow to Ukraine.&nbsp;  To be clear, the theory of funds being withheld from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation does not originate from the July 25 call read out. There is nothing in the text of the call that threatens the withholding of funds in exchange for an investigation.&nbsp;  The theory originates from the fact that aid was held back by the Office of Management and Budget, headed by the President&#8217;s Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and the &#8220;presumption&#8221; of US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that the aid must have been held because of the President&#8217;s desire to get the Biden investigation done, since the President&#8217;s attorney, Rudy Giuliani was working to find out more about the Biden investigation.&nbsp;  Ambassador Sondland told multiple people about his theory, but when he finally called President Trump and asked him directly about it, the President responded that he did not have any quid pro quo, he just wanted the President of Ukraine to do what he ran on and &#8220;do the right thing.&#8221; Obviously, people who assume the worst about President Trump take this as a secret message that there actually was a quid pro quo, but the most important fact is that Ambassador Sondland did not read it that way after his call with the President. Ambassador Sondland believed that the President was serious. Unfortunately, the White House Counsel was never allowed to cross examine Ambassador Sondland during the House investigation to get the facts about who he talked to and why he came to believe for a while that there was an effort to push for investigations in exchange for money.&nbsp;  During the Senate trial, I listened closely to the facts surrounding the withholding of aid money to Ukraine. This was by far the most serious charge against the President. Two key questions had to be answered for me: why was the aid held, and why was the aid released. There was no question the aid was held for a couple of months. The question was why?&nbsp;  Statements from the House witnesses during the House impeachment inquiry answered the two key questions: the aid was held because there was a legitimate concern about the new President of Ukraine and his administration in the early days of his presidency and the aid was released on time when the new Ukrainian Parliament starting passing anti-corruption laws in August and after Vice President Pence sat down face to face with President Zelensky on September 1 in Poland to discuss their progress on corruption.&nbsp;  We should not lose track of what was happening in Ukraine in 2019. A new President was elected who was a TV actor with no political experience and no record on how he would handle Russia or the issue of widespread national corruption in Ukraine. He ran on a platform of anti-corruption at all levels, but no one knew how he would govern. His campaign was funded by a Ukrainian oligarch who owned a major media outlet, and one of his first advisers was the former attorney for that oligarch.&nbsp;  I personally spoke to many of the State Department officials in Ukraine in May of 2019 and heard their concerns about the new government. Then, newly elected President Zelensky used his power to dissolve their Parliament the day he was sworn in and called for &#8220;snap elections&#8221; in which the vast majority of the newly elected leaders were from his newly formed party. To our State Department and the White House, this was either a really a good sign or a really bad sign. Either Ukraine was about to take a major change for the better with new leadership, or this new young leader was about to assume real centralized power. No one knew for certain in May, June, and July of 2019. Within a few weeks in August, the new Parliament got to work passing anti-corruption laws and making significant changes in their accountability and for the country. This was a very good sign.&nbsp;  When Vice President Pence met face to face with President Zelensky September 1, both sides had confidence the country was taking a new direction. On September 10 Vice President Pence and Senator Rob Portman met with President Trump to tell him about the progress that had been made, and both advised lifting the hold on aid. The aid was lifted the next day, September 11. No investigation into Hunter Biden or Burisma was ever done by Ukraine, and no part of the US Department of Justice was ever involved in any investigation of Hunter Biden or Burisma.&nbsp;  Though the aid was frozen in June, there was no public announcement of the hold, as explained by the White House Counsel, to keep this from becoming a public issue while the White House monitored the progress and status of the transition in Ukraine.&nbsp;  On August 27, Politico published an article that noted that the foreign aid had been held by the US. This caused President Zelensky&#8217;s office to reach out to the State Department and ask why. During the House impeachment proceedings, four of the House witnesses (Ambassador Voelker, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor, and Tim Morrison) all testified that the Ukrainian leadership learned about the temporary hold in aid after the Politico article was published.&nbsp;  The issue of the hold was also the first question from President Zelensky to Vice President Pence when they met September 1 in Poland. The idea that the leadership in Ukraine had pressure placed on them to do an investigation fails the most essential test, did the leadership of Ukraine even know that the aid was being held? The answer from multiple American and Ukrainian leaders was no, they did not know there was a hold on the aid from the White House. You cannot have pressure to act on an investigation, if they did not even know the aid was being held.&nbsp;  It is interesting to note, when I researched the records of past foreign aid payment dates and times to Ukraine, I found the 2019 aid was in line with the date the 2016, 2017, and 2018 aid was sent. The vast majority of the military aid to Ukraine was obligated in August or September for the past four years. Though the aid was ready to go out the door a couple months earlier in 2019, it was certainly not late, based on the record of the previous three years. In fact, the State Department aid was obligated September 30 in 2019, but it was obligated September 28 in 2018. As quoted by the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, &#8220;the aid was held such a short time, we did not even notice.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the two days of question-and-answer time, I asked a specific question related to this issue because I felt it was important to get the context of the aid, since there had been so much made of the issue during the trial. Here is the full text of my question to the White House Counsel:&nbsp; House Managers have described any delay in military aid and state department funds to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in September and in 2017, 73% of the funds were obligated in September. In the State Department, the funds were obligated September 30 in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 in 2018. Each year, the vast majority of the funds were obligated in the final month or days of the fiscal year. Question: Was there a national security risk to Ukraine or the United States from the funds going out late in September in the two previous years? Did it weaken our relationship with Ukraine because the vast majority of our aid was released in September each of the last three years?&nbsp;  In response to my question, White House Counsel detailed the fact that military aid from the US was not for immediate use. It was designed to help the Ukrainian military buy materials for the next year, so it was common for the aid to be obligated at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), and it was also common for some money to be left unobligated and carried over into the next fiscal year, as it was in 2019.&nbsp;  While it is easy to create an intricate story on the hold placed on foreign aid to Ukraine, it is also clear that President Trump has temporarily held foreign aid from multiple countries over the past two years, including: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Lebanon, and others. There is no question that a President can withhold aid for a short period of time, but it must be released by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, which it was in this instance.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Constitutional Issues Around This Impeachment  Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants the US House of Representatives &#8220;the sole power of impeachment,&#8221; while Article I, Section 3 states that &#8220;the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.&#8221;&nbsp;  The Constitution is clear that the House does not control the Senate process and the Senate does not control the House process. However, during the impeachment trial of President Trump, the House tried repeatedly to dictate to the Senate how it should conduct its trial.&nbsp;  The &#8220;sole power to try&#8221; means laying out rules for the trial, including when and if to call additional witnesses or request more documents.&nbsp;  In addition to laying out roles and responsibilities for impeachment, our Constitution also provides basic rights for the accused. The Fifth Amendment ensures due process. However, the receipt of due process is not contingent upon waiving another right, like immunity or executive privilege. But that is exactly what the House tried to force President Trump to do.&nbsp;  The President is not above the law, but neither is the House of Representatives. If there was a question as to the scope and proper use of the President&#8217;s right to assert immunity or executive privilege regarding conversations he had with his closest advisers, that question is proper for a court to determine, not Congress, and surely not the House on its own accord. To put this in constitutional terms, the Legislative Branch cannot prevent the Executive Branch from having access to the Judicial Branch. The House wanted to move quickly and prevent the President from ever going to court to resolve any issue. That has never been done for a good reason, the separation of powers. In previous legal battles with the President, it has taken months to resolve critical issues, like Bush v. Gore in 2000 or even in the Clinton impeachment trial, when the House took two months to resolve an issue with witnesses in court. It does not have to drag on for years.&nbsp;  The House also wanted the Chief Justice of the United States to &#8220;rule on&#8221; any issue quickly, instead of allowing the President to go through the courts. This would have created a new judicial executive branch by putting all the judicial power of the nation in one person, not in the Judicial Branch, as is stated in the Constitution. It would have also ignored the text of the Constitution where it notes that the Chief Justice &#8220;presides&#8221; in the court of impeachment, not &#8220;decides.&#8221; The sole power of impeachment is in the Senate, not the Senate, plus the one Justice. The Chief Justice keeps the trial moving along, based on the rules of the trial, but he or she is not a decider of fact, that is reserved to the Senate. The House Managers wanted to ignore that part of the Constitution to move the trial faster for expedience. We cannot ignore the Constitution or create bad precedent, no matter which party is being tried for impeachment.&nbsp;  Further, the Sixth Amendment guarantees that the accused has the ability to both confront the witnesses against him and to have the assistance of counsel. The majority of the impeachment inquiry in the House was done without a meaningful opportunity for the president to participate and administration witnesses were denied the ability to have counsel present for depositions.&nbsp;  The Constitution lays out a clear separation of powers, but importantly also provides a system of checks and balances. For something as important as impeachment, it is imperative that the process be one that is squarely within the bounds of the Constitution and is one that the American people can trust. Unfortunately, the process undertaken by the House to impeach President Trump falls wildly short of the standards put in place by our Founders.&nbsp;  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that &#8220;the President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.&#8221;&nbsp;  During the trial of President Trump, there was a lot of conversation about what constitutes a &#8220;high crime&#8221; or &#8220;misdemeanor.&#8221; Notably, the House did not charge the President with any crimes. Rather, the House chose to impeach the President for &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; and &#8220;obstruction of Congress.&#8221;&nbsp;  The House theoretically could have chosen to file articles of impeachment for crimes such as bribery, extortion, solicitation of interference in an election, or violations of the Impoundments Clause Act. For any of these crimes, the House would have had to prove specific elements of each. Since they couldn&#8217;t prove any of those crimes, they chose to charge the President with &#8220;abuse of power.&#8221; As was noted in the trial, forty Presidents have faced accusation of &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; going back as far as George Washington.&nbsp;  The abuse of power charge for President Trump was based on allegations that he improperly withheld aid to Ukraine and conditioned a meeting with President Zelensky at the White House in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Over the course of the last four months, we heard the term quid pro quo used over and over again but the facts do not show criminal quid pro quo. As previously mentioned, President Zelensky asked to meet with President Trump in Poland and that meeting was set up. Further, while the aid to Ukraine was delayed, it wasn&#8217;t delayed more than it had been the previous two years, and the aid was released without an investigation (or even an announcement of one) into the Biden&#8217;s.&nbsp;  The second article of impeachment, Obstruction of Congress, had an even weaker constitutional foundation. The investigation was announced September 24, but did not officially begin until October 31. The impeachment vote in the House was December 18. This very short time table and the accusation that the President refused to follow the law, honor the courts and that he acted like a &#8220;King&#8221; did not meet even the most basic constitutional standards for justice.&nbsp;  For example, during the Mueller investigation, the President&#8217;s team fully cooperated with the investigation that included over 2,000 subpoenas and 500 witnesses, including the President&#8217;s Chief of Staff, multiple cabinet officials and many lower-level officials that were all made available. It was clear throughout the investigation that the President did not like or agree with the Mueller investigation, but he also fully cooperated with every subpoena, each witness and every document. In fact, they released over a million pages of documents to the Mueller team.&nbsp;  President Trump also made his disagreement with the courts very clear on issues like the census, whether travel restrictions can be put in place to ensure national security, or whether particular funds can be used to secure our southern border. But, each time the President lost in court, his Administration complied with orders from the Judiciary. That is how our system of government is supposed to work.&nbsp;  When disagreements happen between the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch, they usually lead to resolution, not impeachment. The Fast and Furious investigation, which lasted more than three years in the Obama Administration, led to a vote in the House to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, but it never led to an impeachment inquiry, even though there was a clear and consistent refusal to cooperate with Congress or turn over key documents for three years.&nbsp;  In this case the accusation that President Trump ignored subpoenas or refused to follow the law is not correct. The President&#8217;s team made it very clear that they would cooperate during the impeachment inquiry with properly authorized and issued subpoenas, but the House refused to issue subpoenas that were consistent with the law to seek resolution for documents and witnesses. The House was focused on speed, not legal process.&nbsp;  The House, in a rush to impeachment last fall, issued multiple subpoenas for documents and testimony before the House had given authority to the committees to issue subpoenas for an impeachment inquiry, which happened October 31. Since there was no authority to issue the subpoenas, they were not duly authorized. The House also demanded testimony from the President&#8217;s inner circle without working through the legal questions and the House demanded Executive Agency witnesses appear without allowing them to bring Agency counsel with them. All of those issues created very real legal and constitutional problems. Agency individuals have always been allowed to have legal counsel with them when they are deposed, except this time.&nbsp;  As a Member of Congress, I cannot demand the President turn over documents or give testimony in any fashion that I would prefer, just because I have oversight responsibilities. In the same way, the President or other Executive Branch officials cannot demand I turn over my notes or provide my staff for testimony without going through the courts and gaining a legal subpoena. Congress has vigorously and rightfully protected its rights from unwarranted investigations from any president. And presidents have done the same. But in all cases, the law must be followed and the proper process must be pursued to get the information in a legal way.&nbsp;  Additional Witnesses  From the very first moments of the Senate trial, the House Managers fought for additional witnesses and documents from the President. Their argument, and justification for the second article of impeachment, centered on the White House&#8217;s refusal to turn over documents and make every witness available without going through the normal legal process.&nbsp;  Per the resolution adopted by the Senate, the House record was part of the trial record. The Senate had the testimony of the witnesses the House chose to question as part of the overall information of the trial. The House already had 28,000 pages of documents that were part of the evidence they submitted to the Senate. Although, the House Managers admitted during the Senate impeachment trial that they still have not released all of the documents and witness testimony that they had gathered in their investigation to the White House Counsel or to the Senate. We do not fully know why the House held back some of its witness testimony and released others.&nbsp;  The House witness testimony was used extensively in the Senate trial.  Witnesses who testified live or via video in the House and Senate Impeachment:&nbsp;  David Holmes, Political Counselor, US Embassy Ukraine, State Department&nbsp; Dr. Fiona Hill, White House Adviser, National Security Council David Hale, Undersecretary for Political Affairs, State Department&nbsp; Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense&nbsp; Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union&nbsp; Tim Morison, Former White House Advisor&nbsp; Kurt Voelker, Former Special Envoy for Ukraine&nbsp; Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, National Security Council&nbsp; Jennifer Williams, Aide to the Vice President&nbsp; Marie Yovanovitch, Former Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp; George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State&nbsp; Bill Taylor, Former United States Ambassador to Ukraine&nbsp;  The House Managers repeated over and over that additional witnesses would only take a week to depose, which is a clearly false statement. New witnesses took longer than a week to depose in the House inquiry, clearly it would take just as long or longer in a Senate trial. The remaining &#8220;wish list&#8221; of witnesses all had clear issues that needed to be resolved in the courts, which would take a couple of months to resolve, which is why the House Managers did not push for their testimony in the House impeachment process, they valued speed more than legal process.&nbsp;  House Managers repeatedly stated that witnesses only took a week to depose in the Clinton Senate impeachment trial, but they know that during the Clinton Senate trial all three called witnesses previously deposed in the House inquiry or in the Grand Jury investigation and all issues of Executive privilege had already been decided through the courts. There were no new witnesses in the Senate trial of President Clinton. Also, the Clinton White House had already had the opportunity to cross examine witnesses or the investigators in the Clinton impeachment inquiry; this time the Trump White House had been denied that right. So, if new witnesses would be added for the Senate trial, the White House should have the right to also cross examine the previous House witnesses that they had been denied the right to cross examine in the past. This would all take much longer than a week and the House Managers knew that.&nbsp;  During the Clinton Impeachment trial in the Senate, there were no additional documents requested, only previously deposed witnesses. The House Managers did not go through the legal process to get documents, like the Mueller investigation had done, so all of the new document requests from the House Managers would take at least three to five weeks to complete, once a legal subpoena is delivered. It takes time to search all databases, review the documents for classified materials, determine any legal issues, and release them to the investigation. Once the documents are turned over, both legal teams need time to review the documents. Again, the House Managers knew these facts, but they continued to repeat over and over that it would only take a week to get all the documents.&nbsp;  The first question for the Senate trial was: do we have enough evidence and testimony to answer the questions the House presented in their articles of impeachment? If the answer is yes, then we do not need additional witnesses or documents. If the answer is no, then we do need additional information. There were many leaks and newspaper stories during the trial designed to push the Senate to vote to ask for more testimony, but that did not change the primary question. We already knew from evidence that there was no quid pro quo, no Ukrainian investigations and no withholding of a public meeting with President Trump.&nbsp;  The New York Times story on January 26 and again on January 31 are clear examples of an attempt to bring doubt on the information and witness testimony. Both stories stated that someone had read the pending John Bolton book manuscript and that in the book Bolton stated that President Trump had talked about investigations in exchange for aid funding for Ukraine. The New York Times also wrote that the book would state that Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, were also a part of the scheme. I looked at both stories closely and noticed that the reporters had not read the manuscripts or quoted the manuscripts; they were reports from someone who stated that they had read the manuscripts. Both stories took significant liberties to describe the intent in the manuscripts, but the reporter had apparently also not spoken to John Bolton.&nbsp;  On January 23, 2020, the National Security Council lawyers sent a letter to the legal team handling the book publishing for John Bolton to inform him that the manuscript contained some classified information and it would need have some edits before publication in March. Then, on January 26, the New York Times published a story that someone had leaked some of the details of the book, but they had not released the actual manuscript. While I am interested in seeing the actual manuscript, I am also very aware that this selective leak was designed by The&nbsp;New York Times and whoever leaked the information to influence the ongoing trial.&nbsp;  It was clear from the earliest days of the trial that the House had a clear political strategy as well as a court-room strategy. During the trial I had the responsibility to hear the facts but also to separate the politics from the facts. Politically, it was best for the House to move as quickly as possible through impeachment so that vulnerable Democratic members could vote for impeachment, and then move quickly to other topics. But since the presidential election is in full swing, it was politically better for Democrats to make the Senate trial move as slow as possible to hurt the President during the campaign. That explains why the House did not take the time to formally request documents or testimony from many individuals; they needed to move fast and try to force the Senate to move slowly. It also explained why the House passed impeachment on a party line vote, then held the articles of impeachment for a month before delivering them to the Senate to start the trial. The House Managers said repeatedly that the evidence was clear and that they had proved their case. But, if that was true, why would the Senate need to call additional witnesses? I think the reason is that the witness process was about delay, more than facts.&nbsp;  Final Thoughts  The facts do not support the accusation in the Trump impeachment, and it certainly did not need to come to this moment of national division. While, it was clear that the House Managers wanted to drag the trial on for months in the Senate, through the primary election season, their case consisted of hypothetical story lines and &#8220;presumptions&#8221; more than facts that warrant the removal of a President. This does not meet what Alexander Hamilton in Federalist, No. 65 described as the &#8220;due weight&#8221; for the arguments.&nbsp;  But impeachment has certainly created the division in our society that Alexander Hamilton predicted. Over 200 years ago he wrote, &#8220;The prosecution [of impeachments], will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.&#8221; This has been an incredibly divisive season in our nation. It is not about one person, it is about all of us. We individually choose how we handle disagreements with family, friends, and people on the other side of particular issues. Our government represents us, so it is up to us to model for our government how to handle disagreements.&nbsp;  We are now past impeachment, and it's time to work on the issues that matter most to the American people. As we move forward, every American should speak out on the issues that are important to them and the voices that speak for their point of view. But, we should remember that we have much more in common than we have that divides us. It is my hope that our nation does not go through a season like this again for a very long time and that we can move past this age of impeachment to an age of oversight and accountability.&nbsp;  I appreciate all the engagement with our office during the impeachment proceedings. We had thousands of calls and emails over the past month. We had hundreds of thousands of views on the nightly Facebook Live updates each day during the trial. While not every Oklahoman agrees with every decision I make on behalf of our state, I am grateful most choose to be respectful in expressing their points of view. At the end of the day, we are Oklahomans. We may not all agree on each issue, but we can be respectful of each other in our disagreement.&nbsp;  I am honored to serve our state and nation. We have many important issues to address in the coming days, I pray we can work on them together for the future of our state and nation.

The President&#8217;s State of the Union address detailed the incredible accomplishments America has achieved in the last year. Our middle class is booming and the unemployment rate is as low as it&#8217;s been in half a century. Seven million jobs have been created under his leadership, and in Missouri, real median household income is up eight percent. The economy continues to grow, lifting up working families and creating greater opportunities for the next generation. President Trump has said he would get to work for America, and he told us all how he has kept that promise. He has made it a priority to lower prescription drug costs, secure our border, and combat human trafficking. I will continue to work with him for our suburban families to advance critical initiatives such as passing paid parental leave legislation, addressing the skyrocketing costs of childcare, and ensuring our national security remains strong. Now that President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment, it is time Congress got back to the People&#8217;s business of governing and build on his record of achievements for the American people. Read my State of the Union press release here. I introduced&nbsp;bipartisan legislation with my colleagues to help prevent repeated community flooding. We must help regions at risk of repeat flooding become more resilient. By incentivizing communities to plan ahead for damaging floods, we can avoid continually subsidizing the rebuilding of flood-prone properties through the National Flood Insurance Program. This bill aims to prevent loss of life and property and help communities withstand major floods like those we have recently experienced in Missouri. Read more about the bill here. Republicans introduced a privileged resolution to admonish the Speaker for ripping up the President&#8217;s State of the Union address. Her action was a slap in the face to the President, the dignity of the House, and all of the Americans the President honored in his speech. Democrats should allow us to vote on this legislation so they can go on record and tell the country whether they support such behavior or not.   I had the honor of singing in the National Prayer Breakfast Congressional Choir with my colleagues.&nbsp;This is such a moving event, and I was blessed to attend.   It was great speaking to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) to discuss our work in Congress against human trafficking. Financial institutions are critical partners in the fight against trafficking, and I look forward to working with banks, non-profits, and law enforcement as we find new ways to identify traffickers and help victims find justice. I was honored to receive an award from ACAMS for my work in the fight against trafficking and appreciate their support and partnership.   The purpose of U.S. global health and economic development programming is to recognize, promote, and protect the dignity of all individuals, and to extend a helping hand so that the marginalized, poor, and vulnerable around the world may build a better future. Abortion is not compatible with this mission. Children and families should not be enumerated as barriers to prosperity, but seen as sources of strength, beauty, purpose, meaning, and potential. We will not make the challenge of ending poverty a &#8220;little simpler&#8221; in the short term by pushing women to end the lives of their children. Instead, we will continue to ensure that all women and children have access to healthcare, opportunity, and success. During our Foreign Affairs hearing on women and global health, I asked our witnesses how we can better help women have both their baby and their dreams. We also discussed how abortion is a key driver of gendercide, the global epidemic of violence against women and girls.    I had a great visit with kids from Step Up St. Louis and the Jefferson County Drug Prevention Coalition to talk about the many ways they are working to educate students on the many dangers of addiction and how they can identify the signs.&nbsp;   Sincerely,   Ann WagnerMember of Congress                                        Washington, DC Office2350 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: 202-225-1621    Ballwin District Office301 Sovereign CourtSuite 201Ballwin, MO 63011Phone: 636-779-5449               Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email If you no longer want to receive these emails, please click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to unsubscribe.&nbsp; Please DO NOT reply to this email.

On Tuesday, the President delivered the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. I was disappointed that President Trump used a moment that should be an opportunity to unite the country behind a robust vision for the future to instead deliver a divisive campaign-style speech. The following day, the Senate failed to get the necessary 2/3 majority to convict President Trump, despite the clear evidence that President Trump compromised our national security for his own political personal gain and solicited foreign interference in our election. It is deeply troubling to me that a majority of Senators refused to allow a full and fair trial by blocking admission witness and documents into the Senate proceedings. I remain profoundly worried that this trial will set a precedent for future Presidents.  Nevertheless, regardless of your views, the important thing now is that we move forward as a country. Throughout the impeachment process, the House has continued working on behalf of the American people. Last year the House passed more than 400 bills, including 275 with bipartisan support.&nbsp; That pace continues into 2020 and just last week we passed legislation to reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is critical to our local environment, as well as the PRO Act which strengthens workers&#8217; right to organize. This week, we are expected to address legislation related to public lands and the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as hold a hearing on surprise medical billing in the Ways and Means Committee.  At home over the weekend, we had a full house at our most recent Congress on Your Corner town hall in Winthrop Harbor. I was also grateful for everyone who turned in Valentines to our office for local veterans &#8211; it was a privilege to distribute them over the weekend at a Lake County Honor Flight event and at Lovell Federal Health Care Center.  &nbsp;  HOLDING THE NRA ACCOUNTABLE  I am continuing to work to hold the NRA accountable for its potentially illegal abuse of our tax-exempt system, taking advantage of not just American taxpayers, but also misappropriating donations from NRA members. Last week, I released a report detailing detailing a pattern of misdeeds, including an egregious spending by NRA leaders, extensive self-dealing and conflicts of interest, and pervasive efforts to evade transparency. I am again calling on the IRS to investigate these potential improprieties on behalf of the thousands of law-abiding non-profit organizations and hardworking taxpayers.    &nbsp;  INVITING VIETNAM VETERANS TO COMMEMORATION CEREMONY IN LAKE FOREST    I am honored to host another opportunity in Lake Forest&nbsp;on Saturday, February 29, 2020&nbsp;to&nbsp;recognize the veterans of the Vietnam War as part of the congressionally authorized &#8220;United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration.&#8221;  At the event, official Vietnam War 50th Commemoration lapel pins, official certificates, and proclamations will be distributed to veterans. Attendees must RSVP using the below form and submit a DD214 to demonstrate eligibility. If you do not have a DD214 copy, our office can help you obtain one. The commemoration items may be presented to veterans posthumously if the family completes an application on their loved one&#8217;s behalf.  RSVP with the form on our website.  I hope you will join us.  &nbsp;  INVITING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO 2020 MODEL CONGRESS!    One of my favorite programs is our Model Congress for high school students.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thrilled to again host this year&#8217;s Model Congress on March 15 at Adlai E. Stevenson High School.&nbsp; The Model Congress is a hands-on &nbsp;opportunity for Tenth District high students to simulate the work of a Member of Congress. Students will hear expert testimony, debate amendments in committee and vote on legislation. I&#8217;ll be participating as well, presiding as Speaker.  This year&#8217;s Model Congress will be held on Sunday, March 15, 2020 from 9:00am - 3:00pm at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire.  Tenth District High Schools may select up to ten students to participate. Please have all nominated students submit the application form to our office. The deadline for registration is February 14th.    &nbsp;  CENSUS 2020 UPDATE    It's so important that everyone in our communities is counted as part of the 2020 Census. To that end, learn more about how the Census is fighting the spread of false misinformation that could depress participation.&nbsp;  Learn more about putting 2020 Census rumors to rest  &nbsp;  NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS  Our constituent service representatives hold  in communities across the Tenth District to more easily meet with constituents about any casework needs. My team will be in Lake Bluff and Waukegan this week. If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!  &nbsp;  WEEKLY WRAP-UP   We had another wonderful #CongressonYourCorner town hall on Saturday in Winthrop Harbor.&nbsp; It was a standing room only gathering, and the wide-ranging conversation touched on high drug prices, protecting the Great Lakes, local flooding, bipartisanship, and more. I want to extend a special thank you to Scout Troop 667 for presenting the colors and leading the pledge of allegiance.  &nbsp;    Our annual &#8220;Valentines for Vets&#8221; campaign collected more than 1,200 cards from constituents and area schools (a new record)! I had the great honor to personal distribute some of these beautiful cards over the weekend at the Lake County Honor Flight breakfast and at a bingo game Lovell Federal Health Care Center. Special thanks to the 4-H Club for helping make the afternoon at Lovell so nice.&nbsp; And thank you to everyone who participated to share our gratitude with and brighten the day of so many local veterans.  &nbsp;    Last Thursday, I was honored to welcome Pastor Wade Stevenson to Washington last week as my guest to the National Prayer Breakfast in recognition of the important work done by Gideon Missionary Baptist Church in the Waukegan community. I would encourage you to  who shared an important and timely message about overcoming our political polarization and replacing contempt with love.  &nbsp;   It was great to meet last week with UAW Region 4. They were visiting to talk about the PRO Act because our nation&#8217;s workers deserve a voice at the negotiating table. This legislation strengthens workers&#8217; power to stand together and negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, and safer conditions. The bill passed in the House on Thursday.  &nbsp;    As we discussed in last week&#8217;s newsletter, I was very excited to welcome North Chicago Community High School's Dr. David Brothman as my guest to the State of the Union address. We are certainly in the midst of historic times, and our public school teachers like David have the responsibility to educate and inspire our next generation of engaged citizens. This picture was taken in my office just before heading to the House chamber.  &nbsp;            During Gun Violence Survivor Week, we remember the survivors of this horrible epidemic. I spoke on the floor about why it&#8217;s time for Leader McConnell to do right by the countless survivors of gun violence and bring a vote on universal background checks (HR 8).  &nbsp;    Finally, I shared an update on my fight to restore the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction at the legislative breakfast of the Lake County Municipal League.&nbsp; It was a great turnout for early on a Saturday morning.&nbsp; I was especially pleased and impressed by the emphasis on unity and working together to make our local communities stronger today and in the future.

Congressman Hagedorn is pleased to report that hardworking southern Minnesotans have benefited from a number of achievements in January, including final passage of the USMCA and Phase One of the U.S.-China Trade Agreement being signed by the president. These trade wins mean protecting our jobs and better market access for our agriculture, manufacturing and medical products. The 2019 final jobs report reflects this sentiment as well, showing near record low unemployment and rising wages in Minnesota. Jim&#8217;s small contractors legislation also passed the House in January, making our small businesses more competitive when bidding for prime contracts. Additionally, Hagedorn has now completed 16 of the 21 stops on his district-wide Town Hall Tour, which is set to be complete in February. Rep. Hagedorn started off the month of February by focusing efforts on expanding working families&#8217; access to affordable, quality childcare services by signing on as an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Small Business Child Care Investment Act. This legislation works to expand access to childcare by granting non-profit childcare providers access to the same types of&nbsp;Small Business Administration (SBA) loans available to for-profit companies. For more updates from Rep. Hagedorn, subscribe to his newsletter&nbsp;and follow him on&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Twitter.  &nbsp;  January 8: &#8220;Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act&#8221; Receives Bipartisan Support  Jim speaks on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of his bill, H.R. 5146, the &#8220;Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act,&#8221; which works to remove barriers to entry for small businesses seeking to compete for federal prime contracts by requiring contract officers to consider the relevant past performance and subcontractor experience of these companies. The House adopted Hagedorn&#8217;s legislation by voice vote. Watch below:   &nbsp;  January 10: SKOL Vikings  Jim and his Minnesota delegation colleagues come together in bipartisan fashion to cheer on the Vikings ahead of their playoff game against the 49ers.   &nbsp; January 15: Hagedorn Meets SBA Administrator Carranza  The House Small Business Committee Republicans host newly appointed SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza.

Lara started the first ACERT program in 2015 at Amoskeag Health, in collaboration with the Manchester Police Department and YWCA NH, to provide services and resources to children who have experienced trauma. ACEs, or Adverse Childhood Experiences, are events in a child&#8217;s life which have a&nbsp;significant negative&nbsp;impact on their future wellbeing. I introduced legislation that would allow for the creation of ACE Response Teams (ACERTs) throughout the country - teams based on the model Lara helped pilot in Manchester, which has since expanded to other towns including Laconia and Concord.&nbsp; Lara&#8217;s role in creating ACERT in New Hampshire has been instrumental in addressing these challenges and protecting our kids. I was proud to have her join me to highlight our shared vision of expanding ACERT to communities nationally.&nbsp; You can click HERE to learn more about Lara and ACERT.  Working Together to Strengthen the State of Our Union  While the state of our union is strong, we still have much more work to do to ensure that every American can share in our country&#8217;s success. I was pleased that the President, in his address to Congress this week, expressed his desire to work with Congress to tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing our families and our communities. I remain committed to working in a bipartisan fashion to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, reduce the cost of prescription drugs, ensure veterans get the care they have earned, and combat the addiction epidemic. However, we need more than words; we need action. In the House, we have already passed historic legislation that will make life-saving medications more affordable. The Senate should immediately take up and pass H.R. 3, and I urge the President to honor his commitment to sign it into law &#8216;without delay.&#8217; I was disappointed that the President failed to outline a comprehensive vision to rebuild our nation and make badly needed investments in transportation and infrastructure. The House has already advanced a far-reaching infrastructure framework. I call on the President and my colleagues in the Senate to come to the table. The American people expect us to come together to seize these opportunities to deliver real results, and I won&#8217;t rest until we make fundamental progress. Rebuilding America&#8217;s Infrastructure&nbsp;  Last week, I also helped unveil House Democrats&#8217; new framework for a five-year, $760 billion investment that would create an estimated 10 million jobs and address some of the country&#8217;s most urgent infrastructure needs. This framework makes substantial federal investments in our nation&#8217;s roads, railways, and airports to move our economy and our country forward. Since I entered office, I have advocated for an infrastructure package that reflects the needs of our Granite State communities. This framework will allow us to advance legislation in the coming weeks to address our urgent infrastructure needs, create good-paying jobs, spur economic growth, and protect our environment. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this critical priority through the House. Demanding Resolution to VA Provider Payment Issues        Congressman Pappas listening to VA community care providers and veterans in Laconia about VA provider payment issues    The care that community providers give to our veterans is so important. It is also critical that community providers&nbsp;are&nbsp;paid in a timely manner so that veterans can get the care they need without delay. That&#8217;s why I was immediately concerned when my office heard repeatedly from community care providers about delays in payments and other issues with the VA -&nbsp;problems that are&nbsp;costing them money and hindering care for veterans.&nbsp; I led a bipartisan letter to the VA calling on the Department to move quickly to&nbsp;address these concerns. We must demand better from the VA. I will continue to do everything in my power to bring attention to this critical matter while working with my colleagues and the VA to ensure our veterans get the best care possible. In addition to this letter, I have met directly with care providers and veterans and will continue to press for answers in my role as Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.&nbsp; If you are a community care provider who is experiencing issues like this with the VA, please contact my office so that we can help.  Improving Efficiency at the VA  This week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report which found that the VA has failed to take meaningful action to address serious deficiencies in a key medical supplies purchasing program - problems that have slowed the delivery of care to veterans. As the Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for the House Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee, I am committed to doing everything I can to enhance the quality of care at the VA.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the latest audit I requested shows that the VA has failed to make meaningful progress toward fixing the long-standing problems plaguing its inadequate and inefficient medical purchasing system. The failure to address this mismanagement is unacceptable, and I will continue to work with my colleagues and the VA to ensure that corrective action is taken immediately.

Eight years ago, when I took my first oath of office in Congress, I swore to support and defend the US Constitution. I thought of that oath often as the House considered whether to impeach President Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;voted for impeachment&nbsp;because of the overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power by asking a foreign country to meddle in our election and then trying to cover up his wrongdoing by obstructing the House&#8217;s investigation. History will judge the Senate&#8217;s vote yesterday to acquit President Trump. As the House continues our work on behalf of the American people, we will build on the&nbsp;hundreds of bipartisan bills&nbsp;we have already passed&#8212;and&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;uphold our Constitutional duty&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a vigorous&nbsp;check on the Trump administration.     Join Me at a Town Hall Meeting in April Every year I hold town hall meetings around NW Oregon so I can hear firsthand from the people I&#8217;m honored to represent. My spring series of town hall meetings will include six events in April. Please join me! There will be additional details for&nbsp;each event on my website&nbsp;soon. All weekday events will be in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Vernonia &nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 6&nbsp;   Tigard &nbsp; Tuesday, April 7&nbsp;   Portland &nbsp; Saturday, April 11&nbsp;   Warrenton &nbsp; Monday, April 13&nbsp;   McMinnville &nbsp; Tuesday, April 14&nbsp;   Hillsboro &nbsp; Thursday, April 16&nbsp;       We All Need Health Care Access to&nbsp;health care is a human right, but far too often people in our community face communication, cultural, and financial barriers that prevent them from accessing care. That&#8217;s why I brought Serena Cruz, the Executive Director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation and an advocate for health care accessibility and immigrant rights,&nbsp;as&nbsp;my guest at the State of the Union address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center&nbsp;provides&nbsp;critical&nbsp;health care&nbsp;services&nbsp;and is named for a six-year-old daughter of migrant farm workers who died after a cut in her foot became infected. If she had been able to access health care, Virginia would have turned 51 years old&nbsp;last month. Today, Serena reports that the clinic is seeing pregnant women who are too afraid to seek the prenatal care they need because of the frequent attacks by&nbsp;President&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;and&nbsp;his administration on&nbsp;immigrants&nbsp;and&nbsp;people of color. We must stand up for all members of our community. In Congress, I am committed to stopping hateful policies and fighting for increased access to health care for all.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt Addressing the high cost of higher education is one of my priorities, and one of the reasons I entered public service. Students today face a very different reality than I did: I was able to work my way through community college, a bachelor&#8217;s degree, and a law degree with a manageable amount of debt. When I sent out a survey about student loans last fall, more than 700 people responded. They described their student debt as being stressful, burdensome, painful, and overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; To help these borrowers and others like them, I recently&nbsp;held a clinic on student loan debt&nbsp;with a national expert. There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to address crushing student debt, like making it easier for borrowers to access and stay in&nbsp;affordable&nbsp;repayment plans. The House Education &amp; Labor Committee included that provision and several others I drafted in the College Affordability Act. I hope the House will vote on this legislation soon to provide needed relief to students and borrowers.&nbsp;     At Home and at the Border,&nbsp; Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies Cause Harm I recently visited the Southern Border&nbsp;to investigate the Trump Administration&#8217;s Remain in Mexico policy, which has&nbsp;stranded tens of thousands of asylum-seekers&nbsp;in dirty and dangerous tent camps. In Matamoros, Mexico, I&nbsp;saw families and many children living in squalor, without running water or adequate food.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;no way to treat families&nbsp;who are coming to the United States to escape violence&nbsp;or persecution and who have the right to request asylum under international law.  When I returned home I met with nine asylum-seekers, including an unaccompanied child, who are participating in the legal asylum process. They told me about the dangers they fled and the hardship they have experienced here, all in the hope of making their case for asylum and building a better life in the United States of America.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too often this administration has attacked immigrants and fueled racism and xenophobia. In a roundtable discussion with&nbsp;a dozen local advocates, I heard about how fear and anxiety is clouding the lives of our immigrant neighbors, including&nbsp;Dreamers who have known no other home&nbsp;and now risk being deported. I&nbsp;stand with our immigrant neighbors&nbsp;and our friends, who are an integral part of our communities and&nbsp;must&nbsp;be treated with dignity.&nbsp;    In Case You Missed It  I helped improve the&nbsp;major new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada&nbsp;in the areas of labor, environment, access to medicines, and enforcement. After a protracted battle with the Administration, we secured an&nbsp;agreement that is better for Oregonians, workers, and the environment.&nbsp; My bipartisan&nbsp;Blue Carbon for the Planet Act&nbsp;will harness the powerful ability of&nbsp;healthy wetlands, tidal marshes, and seagrasses&nbsp;to&nbsp;sequester&nbsp;carbon for centuries or even millennia and mitigate the climate crisis.&nbsp; The House passed the&nbsp;bipartisan&nbsp;Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,&nbsp;which&nbsp;I co-led, to&nbsp;protect the&nbsp;civil rights of older workers&nbsp;in the workplace.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;helped advance&nbsp;legislation to&nbsp;make sure that&nbsp;pregnant workers&nbsp;have the accommodations they need&nbsp;to&nbsp;work and stay healthy&nbsp;during pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal funding will support the&nbsp;Portland Art Museum&#8217;s new Rothko Pavilion&nbsp;and the renovation of the&nbsp;Astoria Library.&nbsp; I was proud to lead a group of my colleagues in&nbsp;nominating Saudi women&#8217;s rights activist&nbsp;Loujain&nbsp;al&nbsp;Hathoul&nbsp;for the Nobel Peace&nbsp;Prize.&nbsp;             &nbsp;      &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp; Washington, DC 2231 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington,&nbsp;DC&nbsp;20515Phone: (202) 225-0855Fax: (202) 225-9497 Beaverton Office 12725 Southwest Millikan Way, Suite 220Beaverton, OR 97005Phone: (503) 469-6010Fax: (503) 469-6018 &nbsp;         &nbsp; &nbsp;   |               /***** SMARTPHONE STYLING RULES *****/ @media only screen and (max-width: 497px) { *[class*=\"container\"] { width:100% !important; table-layout:auto !important;} }  ","district":"1","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"OR","party":"Democrat","score":3.3524106},{"name":"The Durbin Report","address":"newsletter@durbin.senate.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-04","subject":"How to Save the Lake Michigan Shoreline","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                 The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin                                       Fellow Illinoisan,  Like most Illinoisans, there is a special place in my heart for Lake Michigan.&nbsp;  But more recently, extreme weather &amp; flooding in Illinois has had a major impact on the environment, infrastructure, and economy of the Lake Michigan shoreline. If this weather continues, it will do untold damage to the future of our beloved Great Lake.&nbsp;  Climate change threatens so much of what Lake Michigan provides to our state: recreation and relaxation by the shore, clean drinking water, and natural beauty. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle must recognize the challenge climate change presents and support legislation that addresses both mitigation and resiliency.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Along with a group of bipartisan Senators, I&#8217;ve repeatedly called on the Trump Administration to move forward to fund and complete the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study. This study would identify areas in the Great Lakes that are vulnerable to climate change and recommend measures and infrastructure to increase resilience.  I&#8217;ve also called on the Army Corps of Engineers to help expand the shoreline project to additional sections of the lakeshore and protect against rising lake levels. I recently spoke to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (ASA) for Civil Works, R.D. James, who oversees the Army Corps, and urged him to make these projects a top priority in this year&#8217;s budget.  The bottom line is this: we need to wake up and work together to strengthen our shorelines by letting science, not politics, guide our actions. Lake Michigan has been great to us, and it&#8217;s about time we return the favor.  Sincerely,&nbsp;  U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)  &nbsp;                                           &nbsp;  &nbsp;Click here to open a plain text version of this email&nbsp; &nbsp; Click here to forward this email&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click here to comment on this email   ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Democrat","score":5.3033347},{"name":"Representative Amata Radewagen","address":"AQ00AROutreach@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-03","subject":"Supporting Young Fishermen","body":".show_password_icon{cursor:pointer !important;position:absolute !important;background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADAAAAAwCAMAAABg3Am1AAACjlBMVEVsbGxtbW0mJiYkJCQmJibU1NTh4eEiIiI5OTkWFhZ7e3sYGBjBwcF/f38hISEzMzNMTExwcHAdHR0ICAgmJiZWVlYtLS0hISEkJCQmJiYiIiIPDw8oKCgdHR0LCwsREREVFRUYGBgTExMuLi4oKCgLCwsODg7ExMQtLS0dHR0fHx+2trYrKytvb28+Pj4WFhYVFRUUFBTGxsaqqqoZGRlKSkqEhIRFRUUVFRXNzc00NDQzMzN6enrExMQwMDCzs7MoKCgbGxtYWFivr69DQ0NUVFSrq6sbGxuGhoaNjY06OjoZGRmHh4caGhqzs7NAQEB/f39NTU1BQUG+vr4cHBwdHR2FhYUjIyMkJCQmJiYHBwcHBwcHBwcGBgb///8JCQkwMDAyMjIyMjILCwsMDAwXFxcQEBAuLi4yMjIwMDAwMDD6+votLS0pKSnOzs7///9qamr////////////w8PD29vby8vL///////////////////8AAADl5eWXl5eOjo5JSUlLS0umpqbk5OTKysqampqcnJy7u7ulpaV4eHiYmJiFhYXDw8PFxcWTk5O8vLzU1NSJiYlkZGRSUlKpqam3t7eNjY3g4OCBgYHQ0NCqqqpGRkY7Ozs8PDxDQ0N3d3c/Pz9hYWFCQkIuLi5ycnKWlpZ7e3tTU1OioqJFRUXx8fFzc3NHR0dISEgxMTHh4eFiYmI0NDSQkJBRUVFBQUFeXl4iIiLLy8tKSkrv7+/y8vIyMjIBAQEODg4mJiYCAgINDQ0LCwsoKCgJCQkICAgqKioQEBArKyswMDAkJCQZGRkcHBwaGhoEBAQjIyMSEhIeHh4VFRUXFxcvLy////8TExMGBgYfHx8hISEtLS1dAXVSAAAAfXRSTlP+/B9vD+J3oN6z02/mVU93fMjbs9vI2y8vLy/bs4+goF8vX6Avx2/2j+4P6U+bt8DuTzuu9qpV209Kp+LpgYHb6Q/iVlk7rq5Vh8xvVX8sncDp0vZvL1Xux28/T3+zT0/Hj18fHy8fHx9vD7MPD66P/18vf+7H26BvHz8PAGffyJwAAAKMSURBVHja7dXVX9tQGAbgzN3d3d3d3X24M5yVetp+c3d3F9yhsJVtDLqxFdYh5UDLf7McSUih3X6744LnJvnek/ciSXPKwX9qL7TRQkx4WGj9J6I+NCw85u+FuNihthZWxcZ5LURPqvdoZbTHQsL0Jq/2JbQuzLb+FKWmJH8QJKekSpFtc4tC4ugKJj3tBNLp1UaBWt8l7Z6YH0yUFyYPtlJF55GGN4DEwM8qYktvtzQXRlSXEuZbSGsU5o5+vj4+vn6dATOuM9NV226xMNxVSVwr0QTjrBObrf2AVl7R2badFkY6q7GcS0hhwuvdqiVDgNqaQ8Z3R3FhmNOFnTlnCQasr0tmEVCbssnYtBS4mQOd2OkSHbvXGU6Z50ag9r4m87OF3JhaLLtEZwLiSC2RmUmP04AxvSFzB+4XloWvpw6T4CLS9yQnT1UgyicBZxek4+uZPXYM8QDk5KESRBte4ICrEpT2NknxrirsAkAvcnJfDaIJDhxw8x2Cyj5SfMxBdO9Bj7eV0kIdnvO55XVYcX8QLa6TMSPxHsY3kOABB0saiDnALGiQuaFj6UQ630EcwLIaYicwc2skVxF7D+PonITUnDAd+EFURAE1wEkD51nEkyBqFA2SkJ7+Wjd+IarWAtX11EfByQwLveOpZXT9CtKL38P+Mmp9JHutvFbAk4cdOYUtXkaK5i9uh72c2hYBbiLGsgX7daSUf9MrXn5j5oWAJGSQmGZlWIzum4BpteM7Ux4UGODvHxAY1CgmjptIa2q1L60pavTibq6F97SRGY7n/fYgLxfpDSAvyCvvi7+6KX78iF0uL8grikMFha7PhKuw4AnSqA3/2u5VfLwGEZp4XtUG/lDaCx78AU3oAkjRRCc1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC) center center no-repeat !important;padding:0 1px !important;margin:0 !important;border:0 !important;background-size:18px 18px !important;width:18px !important;opacity:0.7 !important;-webkit-transition:opacity 200ms !important;}.show_password_icon:hover{opacity:1 !important;-webkit-transition:opacity 200ms !important;}  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                &nbsp;  Talofa Lindsey, This week, the Natural Resources Committee passed a bipartisan bill to strengthen the future of fishing. I am an original cosponsor, one of a bipartisan group of four legislators upon introduction of the bill. I voted for it in the Natural Resources Committee, where it passed by unanimous consent. The Young Fishermen&#8217;s Development Act, H.R. 1240, promotes the development of the next generation of commercial fishermen with new federal grant support. Fishing is the lifeblood of our economy, and has always been part of the lives of islanders. This legislation would ensure that our young fishermen are equipped and trained from the start for a better career. A special thank you to my friend, Dean of the House, Rep. Don Young of Alaska, for introducing the bill along with the original cosponsors. The four of us represent congressional Districts that look to fishing as a staple of the area economy and a strong local tradition.  H.R. 1240 would create a national grant program through the Department of Commerce that &#8211; for the first time ever &#8211; would support training, education, and workplace development for the next generation of commercial fishermen throughout the country.

Soifua,   Member of Congress  &nbsp;     &nbsp;    American Samoa Quarter Event   In January, Congresswoman Aumua Amata welcomed the opportunity to visit the U.S. Mint headquarters in Washington, D.C., meet with Director David J. Ryder, learn more about the process and programs at the U.S. Mint, as pictured here, and enjoy an early look at the soon to be released quarter honoring American Samoa.  The new quarter has an artistic rendering of our distinctive Samoan fruit bats, known to be among the world&#8217;s largest flying mammals. The coin is part of the America the Beautiful Quarters Program by the U.S. Mint. Each coin program is authorized by the U.S. Congress to celebrate and honor various American places, events, and historical figures &#8211; this one celebrates American Samoa!  Our beautiful Park is one of five National Parks that will be honored this year by the U.S. Mint program. Governor Lolo will welcome Director Ryder for the announcement and official launch of the 2020 National Park of American Samoa quarter on Thursday, February 13, 2020, at Su&#8217;igaula o le Atuvasa, Utulei Beach Park, at 10 AM.    &nbsp;   Federal Response to Coronavirus The coronavirus outbreak is a serious matter, and federal authorities are taking numerous steps to contain it and develop treatment. Under the direction of the Health and Human Services Department, several agencies including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health have announced layers of efforts, including diagnosis and testing, exploring antiviral treatments, and working on a vaccine &#8211; totaling $105 million. It is a fact that there is travel between China and island nations in the Pacific region, including our closest neighbors in Samoa.  The Territory was right to alert our medical professionals here in the islands, then make any possible preparations in conjunction with all efforts at the federal level. The Trump Administration is consulting leading doctors and scientists, and in turn, they will keep the Congress informed. The budgets for these federal agencies include funds for vaccine studies and other steps, and these efforts are underway. Congress will be ready if called upon for any additional emergency funding if circumstances require it. Most of all, our prayers for those who are ill and the containment efforts.    &nbsp;   American Samoa Presentation to Vice President Pence  I had the opportunity to present our Territory's wonderful book on American Samoa, by author J. Robert Shaffer, to Vice President Mike Pence in person as a special gift from Governor Lolo and the people of American Samoa! The Vice President's own historic visit to American Samoa in 2017 is highlighted in the book on page 273. The book fit the theme of the evening perfectly, since the occasion was the swearing-in of President Trump's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders at a White House event in celebration of the Lunar New Year. At President Trump's invitation, I serve on the Commission, where I am able to add the viewpoint of an islander living in the islands.  Also, for the first time, there were three Cabinet members present for the proceeding. They included the co-chairs of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans &amp; Pacific Islanders, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, as well as U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia. The Initiative works to see that there&#8217;s cohesion across the many agencies of the entire U.S. government on policies affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Secretary Chao and Secretary Ross are pictured applauding our book presentation to the Vice President.    &nbsp;               Washington, DC Office 1339 Longworth House Office BuildingWashington,&nbsp;DC&nbsp;20515Phone: (202) 225-8577Fax:&nbsp; (202) 225-8757    American Samoa Office PO Box 5859,&nbsp;Pago Pago,&nbsp;AS&nbsp;96799Phone:&nbsp;(684) 633-3601Fax:&nbsp;&nbsp;(684) 633-3607Located at 1 Fagatogo Square      Click here to unsubscribe   Click here to comment or reply           ","district":"At-Large","title":"Delegate","gender":"F","state":"AS","party":"Republican","score":5.19702},{"name":"Congresswoman Yvette D.

In Brooklyn, more intense heat-waves and storms due to climate change are a serious threat to our local power grid, triggering blackouts in many recent years. In the face of this challenge it is imperative that we take steps to protect our communities and make our power sector smarter and more resilient.  Wednesday, January 29, 2020  Subcommittee&nbsp;on Communications and Technology Hearing on Empowering and Connecting Communities through Digital Equity and Internet Adoption   The American people deserve access to broadband devices, the internet and affordable services. Congressman McNerney, Lujan and I recently introduced H.R. 4486, the Digital Equity Act to ensure every person is provided access to the digital literacy they deserve in 2020 and beyond. Information is power and someone&#8217;s income level or neighborhood should have zero impact on their access to broadband internet.  Friday, January 31, 2020&nbsp;  America&#8217;s Bigot-in-Chief has struck again&#8212;this time limiting the rights and banning immigration from certain African countries. President Trump&#8217;s announcement of an African Ban further perpetuates his racist, xenophoic agenda to whitewash America. See tweet here.    IN THE DISTRICT:  &nbsp;  Small businesses are one of the many pillars that make New York&#8217;s 9th Congressional District so unique. Last week's town hall on small businesses was an opportunity that provided information and resources for small businesses in Brooklyn. See tweet here.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nothing is better than supporting tomorrow's leaders. I had the pleasure of meeting Brooklyn's Success Academy Students, 100% of whom passed the 2019 NYS math &amp; ELA exam. Congratulations! See post here.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It was a pleasure meeting IGNITE's Young Women at the Women in Politics lunch. It is important that we integrate more women in government, create more inclusion and develop a stronger pipeline of future women in politics.

See tweet&nbsp;here.  BLACK HISTORY MONTH:    As we enter into Black History Month, I reflect on the life and legacy of Shirley Chisholm who has had a great impact on my own life. See tweet&nbsp;here.    &#8234;Shirley Chisholm first ran for Congress in 1968, and won, going on to serve seven terms as a US Representative.&#8236; As the 1st Black woman to be elected to a Congressional seat, she fiercely advocated for social justice and minority education opportunities. See post here.&nbsp;    Unbought and unbossed (her famous catch phrase), Shirley Chisholm leaves behind a rich legacy, and inspires me every day to work tirelessly as an advocate for our community. Today, and every day, we celebrate the queen, Shirley Chisholm. See tweet&nbsp;here.    Spike Lee is a staple of Brooklyn&#8217;s pop culture, and an icon known across the country. One of my favorite Spike Lee joints, Do the Right Thing, debuted in 1989 and is an incredible portrait of Brooklyn&nbsp;and the values important to our borough.

Further, I was pleased to honor Botetourt County on the House Floor as they are set to celebrate their 250th anniversary. It was a productive week in Washington, but I am pleased to be spending the weekend back in the Sixth District with those I represent.&nbsp;  Danger Pay for U.S. Marshals:   The U.S. Marshals Service often works alongside their DEA and FBI counterparts on dangerous missions abroad. From working to combat transnational criminal organizations to interrupting human trafficking rings, the brave men and women of the U.S. Marshals Service put their lives on the line to ensure the safety and security of American citizens. Yet under the current statute, Marshals do not qualify for danger pay in certain countries as do employees of other federal law enforcement agencies. To remedy this inequity, I along with Lou Corea (D-CA, introduced the bipartisan Danger Pay for U.S. Marshals Act. I am proud to have sponsored this bipartisan legislation which ensures, without requiring additional funding, that our Marshals are compensated fairly and earn the pay they rightly deserve while protecting Americans from violent criminals.&nbsp;         Signing USMCA: After more than a year waiting in limbo, the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) was signed this week by President Trump. USMCA is a big win for the American people, creating a more level playing field for workers, strengthening agricultural trade, and modernizing intellectual property protections.&nbsp;This agreement has the potential to create nearly 600,000 jobs and generate up to $235 billion in economic activity. USMCA opens new markets for our manufacturers and farmers, which will allow them to thrive. American agricultural exports are expected to increase by $2.2 billion under USMCA -&nbsp;with annual dairy exports predicted to rise by nearly $315 million. Further, the agreement is&nbsp;expected to create up to 76,000 new auto jobs, spur $34 billion in new investment in the auto industry, and add $23 billion in auto parts purchases each year. I am excited to have been a part of passing this historic agreement, and look forward to seeing the prosperity it is bound to bring to our country.&nbsp;  The President continues to keep his promise to the American people that he will fight for fairer trade deals for our nation. Not only did the President recently sign the Phase One Trade Deal in which China pledged to increase American imports by $200 billion over the next two years, but he also signed profitable deals with Japan and Taiwan.         Fentanyl &amp; the Opioid Epidemic:  The opioid epidemic does not discriminate based on age, sex, race, or socioeconomic status. It is a plague that affects Americans in all regions of the country, including Virginia&#8217;s Sixth District. In 2016, the United States experienced an astonishing 60,000 deaths related to drug overdose, nearly two thirds of which involved opioids. That means that more than 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose each day, making it the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50. This crisis is being fueled in-part by a synthetic opioid known as fentanyl &#8211; a drug 80 to 100 times more powerful than morphine. In 2018 alone, more than 800 people died from fentanyl overdoses in Virginia.  I applaud my colleagues for voting to save lives this week by renewing the classification of fentanyl as a Schedule I narcotic. Through commonsense solutions like this and support for first responders and treatment programs, I am confident we can help our fellow Americans struggling with opioid abuse and end this insidious epidemic.&nbsp; Fentanyl kills. The small dose pictured below is enough to be fatal.         Botetourt County's 250th Anniversary:  I took to the House Floor this week to recognize the 250th anniversary of Botetourt County.&nbsp; Not only is our region filled with beautiful landscapes, but it is rich in history and culture. Whether it is to experience the countless outdoor recreation opportunities or to immerse themselves in an area with ties to great Americans like Thomas Jefferson and Lewis and Clark, visitors come from far and wide to experience the place where I and thousands of others are fortunate enough to live. May God continue to bless Botetourt County on its next 250 years.&nbsp;         Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman.

The BLM Works for the West When it comes to managing our state&#8217;s treasured lands, it&#8217;s time for a little less D.C. influence and a little more Colorado common sense. As a fifth-generation Coloradan, I believe in Colorado and Grand Junction and&nbsp;I believe we are up to the task of being home to the BLM Headquarters. The great outdoors are part of who we are as Coloradans. We champion groundbreaking research into new alternative energy methods and technology to improve the environment, and we take immense pride that people from all over the world come to Colorado to enjoy our state&#8217;s beauty. Read my op-ed in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel on why Grand Junction is the perfect location for the BLM&#8217;s headquarters.

Wuhan Coronavirus Update Upon learning of the coronavirus outbreak in China, I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to ensure Congress is prepared to serve as a collaborative partner in a successful response.

Congratulations to a Senate Page from Colorado Springs  Join me in congratulating Jennifer St. George from Colorado Springs on finishing the United States Senate Page Program! Jennifer represented Colorado as a Senate Page and I wish her the best in her future endeavors. High school students interested in applying to the U.S. Senate Page Program can find more information on my website. This program provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn about Congress while living, working, and attending classes for a semester in Washington, D.C.  Colorado Unemployment Rate Hits Historic Low Colorado&#8217;s unemployment rate reached a historic low as pro-growth policies are delivering for workers. In December, Colorado&#8217;s unemployment rate dipped to 2.5 percent, the lowest in more than 40 years and 1 percent lower than the national average. According to Ryan Gedney, a senior economist with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, &#8220;we&#8217;re seeing people find jobs that are a great fit for them and also we&#8217;re seeing really strong wage gains.&#8221; I&#8217;m proud of the great economic success we have achieved in Colorado, and I&#8217;ll continue to fight for policies that allow every corner of Colorado to grow and thrive. Firefighter with Colorado Ties Killed in Australia Wildfires  I&#8217;m saddened to hear of the loss of firefighter Ian McBeth, a graduate of Wray High School Class of &#8217;94, who was killed while volunteering in Australia fighting the wildfires. My family and I are sending our deepest condolences to his loved ones and brave firefighters everywhere. China Jails Student for Exercising Basic Freedoms China&#8217;s vision for a less free and open world has reached our shores. The Chinese Communist Party has now imprisoned a University of Minnesota student for practicing the most basic freedoms we cherish in the United States. The United States government has made clear through my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act that we will stand for a free and open Indo-Pacific where democracy and human rights are respected. I&#8217;m calling on the rest of the world to join us and open their eyes to the China threat.

Simply put, we cannot fight climate change without building a clean, energy-efficient economy. The legislation in my agenda aims to secure America&#8217;s path toward a sustainable future. Additionally, many of these bills have bipartisan support and demonstrate specific actions that Congress can take right away to reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to improve public health, strengthen our economy with green jobs, and protect the natural beauty we are so lucky to have in the Granite State. This week I also sat down with the Concord Chamber to discuss my Clean Energy Agenda and explore bipartisan solutions that can decarbonize our economy. From winter sports to maple harvesting, I look forward to my continued work to transition our state to a clean energy economy to protect all that makes the Granite State such a special place to call home. Empowering New Hampshire Businesses  This week I was glad to join community leaders at the New England Council (NEC) to give an update on my work in Congress and discuss how we can work together to grow New Hampshire&#8217;s economy and help our local businesses thrive. The NEC is a wonderful advocate for Granite State families and businesses &#8211; I look forward to our continued work together to ensure our state has the tools it needs to succeed and get ahead.       Working with community leaders to help the Granite State thrive.    Bipartisan Action to Prevent Fentanyl Overdoses&nbsp;  I led Wednesday&#8217;s House passage of the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. Fentanyl is killing people in New Hampshire and across the country. Communities throughout our state have been devastated by the opioid epidemic and we know that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are central to fueling this deadly crisis. We must use every tool available to reduce fatal fentanyl overdoses. On Wednesday, Congress took bipartisan action and averted disaster by ensuring that fentanyl remains a schedule 1 narcotic and members of our law enforcement community don&#8217;t have the rug pulled out from under them. I will continue to work across the aisle to ensure that we combat the opioid and substance abuse crisis from every angle.&nbsp;       Speaking on the House Floor about the legislation. Watch here.     USMCA Agreement Signed into Law  On Wednesday, President Trump signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. I voted in favor of the trade agreement last month, and I was glad to see Congress and the White House work together in a bipartisan way to get it over the finish line. Many Granite State businesses export goods and services to Canada and Mexico, and cross-border trade with our neighbors is crucial to the health and vitality of New Hampshire&#8217;s economy. The agreement signed on Wednesday includes provisions to enforce Mexico&#8217;s labor reforms and safeguard American jobs, more robust rules, and accountability mechanisms to protect our natural resources and improve access to Canadian markets for our dairy farmers.&nbsp;  In addition, House Democrats successfully blocked language in USMCA that would have raised prescription drug costs for Americans, and secured key enforcement provisions to protect American jobs and improve accountability with Mexican labor laws. The agreement that the President provided Congress had insufficient enforcement mechanisms in these key areas, and I was proud to work with my colleagues to fix these problematic aspects of USMCA. While I&#8217;m encouraged that the agreement includes improved environmental protections, there is more we can and must do to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to protect our environment, address climate change, and help the Granite State economy thrive. Honoring Christa McAuliffe  Tuesday marked the 34th anniversary of the Challenger disaster that took the life of Concord High School teacher Christa McAuliffe, along with the lives of fellow crew members Dick Scobee, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Mike Smith and Ellison Onizuka.&nbsp;  Everyone in New Hampshire remembers where they were on the day of the Challenger disaster. Our nation and the students who were privileged to have Christa McAuliffe as their teacher were heartbroken. Christa reached for the stars and inspired her students to do the same. I was honored to join my colleagues to help pass legislation just last year to create a commemorative coin to keep Christa&#8217;s pioneering spirit alive as she continues to spark a passion for science and exploration among younger generations.&nbsp;        Christa McAuliffe    My Guest at the State of the Union Next Week  I&#8217;m proud that Ross Cunningham, Superintendent of the Merrimack County Department of Corrections, will join me in Washington as my guest for the State of the Union Address next week. I deeply respect Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s extensive experience in our justice system and I am grateful for his dedication to ensuring vulnerable Granite Staters with substance use disorder can access the treatment they need. While we&#8217;ve made progress in our fight to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country, we have more work to do. Prevention, treatment and recovery go hand in hand with law enforcement in addressing substance misuse &#8211; we must end the cycle of addiction and incarceration. I&#8217;m glad to host Mr. Cunningham to signal our shared commitment to curbing substance use disorder and supporting those who struggle with addiction.  Here for You  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Patricia, a constituent from Littleton, who had an issue of concern regarding the Social Security Administration (SSA). My staff worked with SSA and helped resolve Patricia&#8217;s issue. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.  Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live. Have a great weekend!

Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, it&#8217;s easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t make progress by standing on the sidelines.&#8221; After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, we&#8217;re not surrendering. In fact, just the opposite: We&#8217;re fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect. It&#8217;s an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives. Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community. I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities. Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you. Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke     &nbsp;    Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents. Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve. Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market. These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home. In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments. The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers. Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings. I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act. This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex. My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes. New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.  &nbsp;     In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the President&#8217;s anti-immigrant agenda. My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R. 6) passed in the House of Representatives last year. According to H.R. 6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America. Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge.   Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the President&#8217;s xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, I&#8217;m committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census. It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community. We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive. Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts. Every person counts.        Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States. I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people. As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests.        Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities. Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R. 4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R. 4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on America&#8217;s national security.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residents&#8212;many in the Ninth District&#8212;were left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared. I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesn&#8217;t happen again. Brooklyn&#8217;s communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century. To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn. With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities. As a firm believer in Congress&#8217; ability to come together and combat this nation&#8217;s contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation.     I am proud that my bill H.R. 5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as &#8220;the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn.&#8221; My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy. Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007. At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing. Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all. In Major Owens&#8217; honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives.        My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell. This inaction is unacceptable. The fact is: background checks save lives. Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns. Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R. 1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm. From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence.        I&#8217;m proud that my bill, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act,&#8221; passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls. If you&#8217;ve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers. These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills. I know robocalls are more than annoying&#8212;they&#8217;re costly. My legislation, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act.&#8221; will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.        Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you. Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents. That&#8217;s why I take every opportunity to celebrate the community, whether it&#8217;s dancing with my friends and constituents at the yearly West Indian Day Parade or eating food from local restaurants and vendors at street fairs, such as the Park Slope 5th Avenue Street Fair.

First, President Trump secured a historic trade deal with China. For too long, China has been allowed to be a bad actor. Phase one of this trade deal will work to rebalance our trade partnership with China to benefit American business, farmers, manufacturers and other hardworking Americans. Among other things, China has committed to purchasing an additional $200 billion in American goods over the next two years. China has also agreed to purchase between $40 and $50 billion in American agricultural goods each year for the next two years. Also this week, the Senate just approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and it's headed to President Trump's desk. I was proud to vote for the USMCA in the House because It has been estimated that it will create more than $68 billion in new economic activity and 176,000 new jobs here in America. THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats finally voted to send their articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate this week. Throughout their entire impeachment process in the House, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle demanded that it was urgent to impeach the President, and it must be done as soon as possible. However, after they voted to impeach, Speaker Pelosi let the articles sit on her desk for nearly a month. This has proven to the American people that there was never an urgent need to impeach the President and has allowed the public to see what we have been saying all along  this is a sham impeachment based on political games and emotions instead of fact. We discuss this and more on this episode of Buddy's Briefing. Click here to watch the latest episode of Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXLIX Monday, January 13, 2020: On Saturday, I was honored to be in Woodbine in Camden County for the inaugural community day celebration on their beautiful waterfront park as the community celebrated the induction of their new Mayor, Kizziler Kizzi Knight. Along with State Representative Steven Sainz, former Mayor Steve Parrott, Sherriff Jim Proctor and a host of citizens, I had the honor of speaking at the ceremony and administering the oath of office to the newly elected Mayor. Rep. Carter at the Tybee Island Martin Luther King Jr Parade Afterwards, I headed to the other end of the District as I marched in the Tybee Island Martin Luther King, Jr. Parade. I have participated in this great parade for six of the past seven years that it has been held. After the parade I participated in a great ceremony where we honored this years Grand Marshal, Richard Shinhoster, and Humanitarian of the Year, Rev. James Maury. We also heard six great presentations from Chatham County Middle and High School speech contest winners. Before flying back to Washington this afternoon, I have our weekly conference call with district staff and, once back in Washington, I have our weekly briefing with the DC staff. Afterwards, I head to our weekly Whip Team meeting before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the week. After votes, I remain in the House Chamber and pay tribute to Tom Wright, who passed recently. A link to my tribute can be found here. Tuesday, January 14, 2020: My first meeting this morning is with the Border Security Caucus as we hear from Border Patrol Chief, Carla Provost and Acting Border Patrol Deputy Chief, Rodney Scott, who bring us up to date on what is happening at the border. Afterwards, I head to our weekly GOP Conference as we welcome the newest member of our Conference, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ). Rep. Van Drew recently switched to our Conference and we are glad to have him join us. Next, I head to the House Chamber where I memorialize State Rep. Jay Powell who recently passed, pay tribute to Nathan Newberg, who was recently recognized as the USO Coastguardsman of the Year, and recognize January 12th as National Pharmacists Day. A link to my speeches can be found here, here and here. Afterwards, I head to an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Environment Subcommittee hearing on hydrofluorocarbons. A link to my questions can be found here. Next, I head to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day. Rep. Carter meeting with Senator Kelly Loeffler After spending some time in my office on paper work, my Chief of Staff and I welcome to our office Senator Kelly Loeffler and her Chief of Staff Joan Carr for a courtesy meeting. I am looking forward to working closely with Sen. Loeffler and her staff as we have in the past with our other Senators. Next, I meet with the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Climate Change that I serve on, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL). The report of the Select Committee is due in March and Rep. Castor is seeking input from members on what we want to include in our report. After a meeting with my good friend Ken Quinn with International Auto Logistics located in Brunswick in Glynn County, I head to a reception with the Ambassador of Switzerland. Wednesday, January 15, 2020: Im at the most beautiful building in America this morning as Im filming this weeks edition of Buddys Briefing at the Library of Congress (LOC). Afterwards, I head to an E&C Health Subcommittee hearing on cannabis policies for the new decade, a very important topic in which I have a keen interest. A link to my questions can be found here. After attending a meeting of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC), I head to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day and afterwards I meet with my good friends Bill Eley and Mike James to discuss pharmacy issues. Rep. Carter speaks with WSAV about impeachment Next, I head to the Cannon Rotunda where I have an on-camera interview with WSAV TV in Savannah to discuss impeachment. Afterwards, I head to Statuary Hall in the Capitol where I attend the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in honor of former New Orleans Saints football player Stephen Gleason whose career was cut short by ALS and whose charity, Team Gleason, has provided almost $10 million in services to over 15,000 people living with the disease. Afterwards, I head back to the House Chamber for our second vote series of the day. Thursday, January 16, 2020: Im in the House Visitors Center (HVC) this morning as we have a GOP policy conference to discuss climate change. I am very pleased that our conference is taking an aggressive, pro-active approach to climate change that will encourage innovation, conservation and preparation by the private sector while continuing to grow our economy. Over the past decade the United States has decreased the amount of carbon emission more than the next 12 countries combined. I am convinced the greatest innovators and scientists in the world are here in the United States and I look forward to the jobs and technologies that will be created as a result of this. Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber for our last vote series of the week and remain in the Chamber afterwards to deliver a memorial to Port Wentworth Mayor Pro-Tem Debbie Johnson who passed unexpectedly earlier this week. A link to my memorial can be found here.  Rep. Carter at Taste of Liberty Before heading to the airport for my return trip home, I attend an E&C bipartisan briefing on the implementation of 21st Century Cures. As soon as I land in Savannah, I head to Hinesville in Liberty County where I attend the annual Taste of Liberty Banquet where they honor the Business Leader of the Year, Civic Leader of the Year and Business of the Year. Friday, January 17, 2020: After our weekly Band of Brothers Bible study, I head to my Savannah office where I meet with an impressive group of business and health care professionals interested in post-partum care and the work I have done in Congress on maternal mortality.

Before I share the details, I want to remind you about our community conversation on affordable housing coming up next Friday. I encourage you to spread the word and I hope to see you there.&nbsp;  STANDING TOGETHER TO PROTECT THE BWCA  On Wednesday I joined Rep. Betty McCollum and some of my extraordinary constituents as we introduced legislation to protect the BWCA by&nbsp;permanently removing roughly 234,000 aces of federal wilderness lands and waters from sulfide-ore and copper mining. I'm very grateful to Rep. Francis Rooney and Rep. Fred Upton, our Republican partners on this important legislation, who&nbsp;shared their own Boundary Waters stories and remind us all that preserving our precious waters is an American issue, not a partisan one.&nbsp;        The Boundary Waters are an American treasure and the stories we share there should extend for generations to come. Click here to watch us introduce legislation to protect the BWCA.    HOLDING BANKING REGULATORS&nbsp;ACCOUNTABLE  Back in November, I shared the good news that the Financial Services Committee unanimously passed my bill to hold big banking regulators accountable, and this week, it passed in the same fashion through the House. There&#8217;s a saying, that &#8220;Sunlight is the best disinfectant.&#8221; In these divided times, we can all agree that the regulators of big banks and our financial institutions have a duty to report their activity to Congress and the American people so we can avoid failures, protect taxpayers, and ensure stability in our financial system&nbsp;        Teamwork is important but often flies under the radar.&nbsp;Read more about my bipartisan Prudential Regulator Oversight Act, which passed the House this week, here.&nbsp;     CONSTITUTIONAL TEAMWORK  Speaking of working together, I teamed up with&nbsp;Reps. Justin Amash (I-MI), Ken Buck (R-CO), Jared Golden (D-ME), Scott Perry (R-PA), Dean Phillips (D-MN), Chip Roy (R-TX), Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) to write this column for the Washington post, in which we assert Congress's constitutional authority to declare war.&nbsp;At a time of divisive, angry partisanship, the call to do right by our service members, their families and the Constitution is one that can and should unite us. We differ in our politics, but we believe Congress should reconsider the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force (AUMFs). I invite you to read the full piece here.&nbsp;  Finally, I remind you that my office is always open for your feedback, questions, and ideas. To that end, mobile office hours are in Mound next week, and our community conversation on affordable housing will be in Maple Grove. And while we may be closing a little early today due to the snow storm, you can reach out anytime online by sending us a message here.

From getting elected Governor in 2010, serving as your Governor for eight years and now as your US Senator, I&#8217;ve loved every minute of working for the state I love.&nbsp;When I ran for Governor, my goal was to turn Florida&#8217;s economy around.&nbsp;The naysayers said it wouldn&#8217;t work; they said a businessman can&#8217;t make government work.&nbsp;But, we did it.&nbsp;During my eight years as Governor, we made things better for families. Florida businesses added nearly 1.7 million jobs and the state unemployment rate went from over 11% to 3.3%. We cut over $10 billion in taxes and paid off nearly one-third of state debt. &nbsp; When I was sworn in as the 100th United States Senator nearly a year ago, I came determined to bring the success we had in Florida to the federal government. I know my job: make life better for the 22 million who call Florida home. I will continue to fight to keep your tax dollars from being wasted, to keep our military strong so it can defend the freedoms we cherish, and to be certain that America stands for freedom worldwide. We&#8217;ve accomplished a lot since 2010, but we&#8217;re just getting started, and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to continue working on behalf of the great State of Florida. Here&#8217;s to another decade of good fortune and success for our beautiful Florida!&#8221;&nbsp;  Sincerely,&nbsp;     &#151;  Read more about Senator Scott's accomplishments throughout the decade in Florida Politics HERE or below:  \"U.S. Sen.&nbsp;Rick&nbsp;Scott&#8217;s role in Florida politics this decade has been more impactful than any other elected official since 2010.  Scott is not only undefeated in elections &#151;&nbsp;he&#8217;s three for three&nbsp;&#151; he also reshaped the state&#8217;s political climate and economy. He led Floridians through the most challenging economic recovery since the Great Depression.&#133;&nbsp;  Early on, Scott dubbed himself the &#8220;Jobs Governor,&#8221; pledging to&nbsp;create 1 million jobs&nbsp;throughout two terms, a goal he met nearly two years ahead of schedule.  Scott aggressively ensured Florida maintained a low-tax state image with business-friendly policies and limited, but not reckless, regulations.  Scott also sought to improve the state&#8217;s bond rating.&nbsp;By the end of his tenure&nbsp;as Governor, the state&#8217;s credit rating jumped to an AAA, one of the highest scores possible, with a stable outlook to eventually achieve Moody&#8217;s highest bond rating.&nbsp;  Scott accomplished that by paying down state debt&nbsp;&#151; he claims he paid off $9 billion &#151; and putting more money into state reserves.&#133;&nbsp;  Scott had other lasting effects on the state, too.&nbsp;  Scott grew up poor and lacked access to the type of education he would later be able to provide for his own children. Because of that, he made growing and improving Florida&#8217;s public college system, including community colleges, a priority....\"  Read the full article in Florida Politics HERE.     &nbsp;      WASHINGTON, D.C.716 Hart Senate Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20510 Phone: (202) 224-5274  TALLAHASSEE111 N.

In addition to participating in several high level diplomatic and military meetings, discussing a wide range of topics including the fight against ISIS in Syria&nbsp;and Iraq, Iranian aggression, trade and more, I had the honor of sharing holiday meals with our deployed service men and women, including&nbsp;106th Rescue Wing Airman Eric VanDyne from Mattituck,&nbsp;106th Rescue Wing Airman David Amerson from Mastic, and Navy Sailor Bruce Kriete from Shirley, during which we discussed how Congress can support our troops on the battlefield and when they return home.&nbsp;       Rep. Zeldin shares a holiday meal with 106th Rescue Wing Airman David Amerson from Mastic while deployed to the Middle East, thanks our troops for their service, and discusses how Congress can support them.    In a district nearly completely surrounded by water, we have a unique responsibility to safeguard our local waterways and bolster our maritime infrastructure. Since coming to Congress, I've&nbsp;worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to secure desperately needed victories for our Congressional District, whether it&#8217;s moving the Fire Island to Montauk Point plan closer to implementation or securing emergency east end projects. I provided an update on critical projects up and down the island here.&nbsp;  My amendment to halt the sale of Plum Island for 12 months was passed and signed into law.&nbsp;The current law, which mandates the sale of the island to the highest bidder, is the wrong path forward. The state-of-the-art research facility at Plum Island must not go to waste, and preserving this island&#8217;s natural beauty while maintaining a research mission will continue to provide important economic and environmental benefits to Long Island. I applaud my colleagues for adopting my amendment to halt the sale of Plum Island for 12 months and look forward to continuing to work with them in a bicameral, bipartisan fashion to pass my stand-alone, long-term legislation &#8211; the Plum Island Preservation Act - to permanently protect the island.  A little rain didn&#8217;t stop hundreds of Long Islanders from coming out to&nbsp;Calverton National Cemetery&nbsp;to honor and remember our local veterans during National Wreaths Across America Day. As we&nbsp;came&nbsp;together this holiday season with our family and friends,&nbsp;it was important to&nbsp;remember that our nation&#8217;s veterans are the reason we have the opportunity to enjoy it with our loved ones in this great nation.&nbsp;Learn more here.        Rep Zeldin joins the Support Committee at Calverton National Cemetery, Civil Air Patrol and Riverhead ROTC Cadets, and local veterans and residents for Wreaths Across America Day and to discuss how Congress can help honor our country's veterans.    I joined local officials, post office&nbsp;representatives, and the family and friends of former NY-1 Congressman Bill Carney to dedicate the Smithtown Post Office in his honor. Congressman Carney was an incredible man who fought tirelessly for his constituents everyday, and, even before his life in politics, his commitment to serving his country and community in the U.S. Army never wavered. Congressman Carney will be remembered for his strength, integrity, and commitment to his district and nation, and there is no place he loved more than Long Island. Now, every time someone enters the Congressman Bill Carney Post Office, his legacy will be remembered forever. Learn more here.&nbsp;        After ushering into law his legislation to rename the Smithtown Post Office in Congressman Carney's honor, Rep. Zeldin addresses Congressman Carney's friends and family at the dedication ceremony.    The Chairman of the FCC called on Congress to repeal the mandated sale of a vital communication tool for our local first responders known as the T-Band Spectrum, andI already introduced legislation to do just that. From hurricanes to fires, in the most dire situations, the T-band spectrum provides critical communication between first responders. Even when cell phones, internet, and electricity cease to function, T-band is the last line of defense, and selling off this spectrum would be a disservice to our nation&#8217;s first responders and the millions of Americans they serve. I urged Congress to focus on the issues most important to the American people, including the immediate passage of my legislation. Learn more here.  Did you know that over 330 million robocalls were placed last month alone in the State of New York? Unwanted and unlawful robocalls, which were once simply a nuisance, have now hijacked consumers&#8217; cell phones and undermined our entire phone system. Consumers should be able to block unwanted and illegal calls and answer their cell phones without fear of being targeted for a scam, which is why I was proud to vote YES on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bipartisan and comprehensive&nbsp;new law&nbsp;that continues to build on our efforts to end this continuous onslaught of robocalls. Learn more here.&nbsp;  The Hashamomuck Cove project received another key approval from the Army Corps. The completion of the project at Hashamomuck Cove is not only important to protecting homes and businesses, but also critical to safeguarding our infrastructure and vital evacuation routes in case of emergencies. Too often we&#8217;ve witnessed&nbsp;a weather event as simple as a thunderstorm&nbsp;at high tide cause serious flooding and property damage for local residents. Local businesses, residents, and first responders cannot afford to wait as their properties and access to Route 48 continue to be threatened, and I will continue to work closely with the Army Corps and local officials to ensure this pivotal project continues to move forward. Learn more here.  It's estimated that the ratification of USMCA will mean 176,000 new US jobs and $68 billion in new US economic growth,&nbsp;according to the United States Trade Representative, better leveling the playing field and delivering a huge win for the American worker. That's why it was critical that Congress ratified this vital deal this month, so we can continue to witness historic economic growth in 2020. Learn more here.&nbsp;  We can&#8217;t play politics when it comes to the vital prescriptions Long Islanders need, which is why I support commonsense and comprehensive legislation that would drive down the cost of these important medicines. The Lower Costs, More Cures Act makes insulin more affordable, places a cap on seniors&#8217; out-of-pocket drug costs, and&nbsp;lowers the cost of prescription drugs by promoting more low-cost options for patients and much more. Learn more here.  I spoke to the Army Corps following the latest washover on Dune Road just west of Shinnecock Inlet where many small businesses and jobs are located.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am encouraged that the Army Corps is doing everything in its power within federal law to respond quickly and effectively to this urgent matter, including expediting approvals to get sand placed as soon at legally possible. Learn more about their efforts here.&nbsp;        Rep. Zeldin and Suffolk County officials survey Dune Road and discuss&nbsp;available options regarding state and federal assistance as well as the availability of funding and needed equipment.    I hosted an important&nbsp;meeting this month with newly-sworn in&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;Administrator Stephen Dickson to fight for relief for residents whose quality of life has deteriorated due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;persistent issue of helicopter noise on the East End.&nbsp;I secured passage into law of my proposal to require the FAA to reassess the North Shore Helicopter Route, and it's time for the FAA to deliver for residents and provide&nbsp;relief. Learn more here.&nbsp;        Rep. Zeldin meets with newly appointed FAA Administrator Dickson to fight for&nbsp;helicopter&nbsp;noise relief for East End residents.    Our community has witnessed the indiscriminate brutality of gang violence first-hand at the hands of MS-13, which swept into and took hold in our communities. Those at every level of government have zeroed in on combating this ruthless gang and ridding their escalating violence from our streets, as evidenced by&nbsp;this month&#8217;s&nbsp;crackdown on nearly 100 MS-13 gang members and associates in Suffolk County alone, spearheaded by county officials in collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Bureau of&nbsp;Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and other agencies. I look forward to continuing to work with those at every level of government to eradicate gang violence from our communities.&nbsp;Learn more here.&nbsp;  This year&#8217;s National Defense Authorization Act was just signed into law, and in addition to including a 3.1% pay raise for our troops, it includes the procurement of 12 HH-60W helicopters as requested by the 106th Rescue Wing out of Gabreski in Westhampton Beach. They&#8217;re one of the few rescue squadrons in the country that use the HH-60G helicopter for their critical missions. However, ever-changing missions have demanded modern equipment, which is why the development, assembly and delivery of the new generation HH-60W is critical to the 106th and the airmen and women who serve there.

The House has passed more than 400 bills this year (more than 275 of those were bipartisan). Some of the highlights include H.R. 5, the Equality Act; H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act; H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act; and H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. However, more than 80% of House-passed bills are awaiting Senate approval. I remain hopeful for action in the Senate during the new year.&nbsp;    I've been working hard to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change and protect Maine's beautiful natural resources. I'm proud that my bipartisan bill, the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act (H.R. 1716), overwhelmingly passed the House on June 5. My bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) to work with state and local experts and assess impacts of ocean acidification on coastal communities.  Meanwhile, our working waterfronts are rapidly disappearing under pressure from climate change and incompatible development. H.R. 3596, the Keep America's Waterfronts Working Act, will protect jobs, commercial activities, and public access to our coast. My bill passed the House on December 10.&nbsp; And as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I helped craft and pass a bipartisan budget for FY2020 that will secure shipbuilding work for the hardworking employees of Bath Iron Works; expand Maine's creative economy; shore up the Land and Water Conservation Fund; and increase investments in climate research&#8212;just to name a few!  I'm proud at all we were able to accomplish this year and I'm looking forward to the next.&nbsp;There's a lot of work to do in the new year, but I'm excited to begin another year of service to the people of Maine.&nbsp; &nbsp;  All my best wishes for a happy New Year,&nbsp;  Chellie  &nbsp;         Stay Connected             Portland Office Portland Fish Pier, Suite 304 Portland, ME 04101 Phone: (207) 774-5019 Toll Free: 1-888-862-6500 Fax: (207) 871-0720 Waterville Office 1 Silver Street Waterville, ME 04901 Phone: (207) 873-5713 Toll Free: 1-888-862-6500 &nbsp;Fax: (207) 873-5717 Washington, DC Office 2162 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515&nbsp; Phone: (202) 225-6116&nbsp; Fax: (202) 225-5590       Unsubscribe&nbsp;|       ","district":"1","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"ME","party":"Democrat","score":4.614093},{"name":"Representative Susan W.

January:  In January I was proud to introduce the Poison Center Network Enhancement Act of 2019, to assist with potential poison exposures and help combat the national opioid crisis.&nbsp; Poison control centers are vital to preventing toxic exposure and poisoning injury and deaths, including opioid and other drug overdoses.&nbsp; This bill reauthorizes funding for the Poison Center Network, including their national toll-free number (800) 222-1222.&nbsp; It also clarifies that poison control centers can be called upon to assist with public health emergencies, responses, and preparedness; and requests that enhanced communications&nbsp;capabilities like texting be established.&nbsp; I am happy to report that in the recently passed spending bill this legislation was reauthorized for a period of 5 years.  &nbsp;   Congresswoman Brooks hosted Tony and Kelly Trent as her guests to the President&#8217;s State of the Union Address and visited Vice President and Second Lady, Mike and Karen Pence.  February:  It was a privilege and an honor to host Tony and Kelly Trent for the State of the Union Address.&nbsp; The Trents are the parents of Tyler Trent, a young Purdue super fan who dedicated his life to inspiring and helping others.&nbsp; Tyler was a remarkable, life-long Hoosier who&#8217;s spirit filled college football stadiums and TV screens as he cheered for the Purdue Boilermakers and bravely battled osteosarcoma.&nbsp; We could feel Tyler&#8217;s spirit in the Capitol that evening.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Congresswoman Susan Brooks joins members of her Youth Advisory Group for a discussion focused on fighting poverty in the Fifth District.  March:  In March I was proud to convene another meeting of my Youth Advisory Group comprised of students between 8th and 12th grade from schools across the Fifth District.&nbsp; Our discussion focused on how each of us can make a lasting impact to reduce poverty locally.&nbsp; Students participated in a simulation where they had to make real-life decisions for how they would budget their minimal finances in order to spend their money wisely.&nbsp; I continue to be impressed by the group&#8217;s enthusiasm to tackle such important topics.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks pins the Bronze Star on WWII Army Medic Walter Murphy at a ceremony in April.  April:  My team was instrumental in securing a long overdue Bronze Star Medal for Walter Roy Murphy who honorably served our country in the US Army during WWII as a combat medic.&nbsp; In the course of Mr. Murphy&#8217;s service he saw action during the Battle of the Bulge and other dangerous battlefields.&nbsp; His heroism during his service had gone previously unrecognized.&nbsp; Thanks to a special provision in law, and the heartfelt work of Mr. Murphy&#8217;s grandson, William Anders, and my office, Mr. Murphy was able to receive the Bronze Star he earned more than 70 years ago for his service.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Indianapolis Police Officer, Jake Laird, shot and killed in 2004 in the line of duty.&nbsp;  May:  May is host to National Police Week and Mental Health Awareness Month.&nbsp; This past May I continued my pursuit of bipartisan solutions to tough problems when I reintroduced the Jake Laird Act, a bipartisan bill named after an Indianapolis police officer who was shot and killed in 2004 in the line of duty by a man who struggled with mental illness. The Jake Laird Act provides grants to states to enact red flag laws substantially similar to Indiana&#8217;s Jake Laird Law, equipping our police officers with training and additional tools to deescalate life-threatening crisis situations. If enacted, such laws will enable local law enforcement, with probable cause, to temporarily remove and retain firearms from individuals who are determined to be an imminent danger to themselves or others. &nbsp;    The President signs PAHPA into law on June 24, 2019.  June:  I was proud to join the President in the Oval Office as he signed a bill that I authored into law.&nbsp; The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 (PAHPA) is the product of years of collaborations between Congress and medical and public health preparedness and response stakeholders.&nbsp; PAHPA will ensure our nation is better prepared to respond to a wide range of public health emergencies, whether the result of natural disasters, infectious diseases or man-made disasters like terrorist attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks meets with Members of the Select Committee to discuss recommendations.  July:  The once-in-a-generation Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, on which I serve, voted to unanimously approve our second round of congressional recommendations.&nbsp; The 24 recommendations were crafted with the intention of boosting the quality of constituent engagement, increasing staff retention and expertise on Capitol Hill and ensuring Americans with disabilities have access to all procedures and functions of the House.&nbsp; The House recently voted to extend the Committee through the end of the 116th Congress.&nbsp; This extension will allow the Select Committee to continue its work proposing bipartisan reforms to make Congress work better for the American people by focusing on increasing civility, reforming the schedule, improving constituent communications and updating the budget and appropriations process.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Congresswoman Brooks joins other elected officials, community leaders and supporters in Anderson for the dedication of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge.  August:  In August it was an honor to join other elected officials, community leaders and supporters in Anderson for the dedication of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge, which links businesses, commuters, bicyclists and pedestrians to downtown Anderson. This bridge is now dedicated to men and women of Madison County who bravely served our country in the armed forces.&nbsp; With my help Anderson was successful in securing a federal TIGER grant of $13.5 million to build this beautiful and critical bridge.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Watch Congresswoman Brooks&#8217; remarks on the House floor in support of H.R. 550, Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.  September:  The House of Representatives passed the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019, a bill I had previously introduced.&nbsp; This legislation will present the highest civilian award Congress can bestow to the Merchant Mariners who acted heroically to transport troops and provide critical supplies of war to U.S. troops by sea during World War II. &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks visits with a class at Noblesville Schools&#8217; Hinkle Creek Elementary School.  October:  Throughout our country, elected officials had the opportunity to participate in National Principal Shadowing Week to bring recognition to the principals hard work and dedication to our students. I was able to join Principal Lawrence of&nbsp;Noblesville Schools&#8217; Hinkle Creek Elementary School&nbsp;and had a wonderful time meeting students, stopping in classrooms and participating in afternoon announcements. Our school leaders are shaping our nation&#8217;s future leaders and I hope everyone takes a moment to say thank you to our principals and teachers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks attends the naming ceremony of the USS RICHARD G. LUGAR.  November:  I was honored to join&nbsp;Senator Todd Young,&nbsp;Senator Mike Braun, the former Secretary of the&nbsp;U.S. Navy&nbsp;Richard V. Spencer and Char Lugar, wife of the late Senator Richard G. Lugar for the naming ceremony of the USS RICHARD G. LUGAR. To be named in Senator Lugar&#8217;s honor, this Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyer warship will help prepare our country for future challenges we may face, equip the men and women of the United States Navy and serve our nation alongside the most powerful naval fleet in the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks joined the Indiana Soybean Alliance/Indiana Corn Marketing Council in August at a Greentown Shop Talk event at Kirkpatrick Farms.&nbsp;  December: In December I was proud to vote for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement because it is a victory for Hoosier workers, farmers, small businesses and manufacturers.&nbsp; Indiana is the 8th largest agricultural exporter in the nation and home to over 500,000 small businesses that employ 45 percent of Hoosiers.&nbsp; As I have traveled the district over the past year the most regular request I received was to finally pass USMCA.&nbsp; I am happy to say as the last vote of the year on December 19th, we got that done.&nbsp; When USMCA becomes law it will foster economic certainty and open new markets for Hoosier farmers and businesses, a major victory for the Fifth District.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and I look forward to continuing to work on behalf of all Fifth District Hoosiers in 2020. &nbsp;To get instant updates on my work, be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

For the last three Christmases, my wife, Gayle, and I have invited students to make ornaments to hang on the tree in my office. This tradition started in 2017 with our state&#8217;s bicentennial, when talented students and teachers turned this occasion into an educational experience to study and commemorate the Magnolia State&#8217;s 200-year story. I continued this year with ornaments celebrating Mississippi&#8217;s arts, crafts, history, science, technology, and the abilities of our young people. On December 6, I visited Petal High School to pick up another set of beautiful, handcrafted ornaments. They are now displayed for all of my visitors in Washington, bringing a spot of holiday cheer. They are also reminders of Mississippi&#8217;s contributions to the world, its bright future, and the beauty and miracle of Christmas. Mississippi Traditions  The theme for this year&#8217;s decorations is &#8220;Telling the Story of Mississippi &#150; From Rockets to Rock Stars and Beyond.&#8221; This project provided students a chance to showcase what they love about our state, and they chose to cover an enormous amount of material. As William Faulkner once said, &#8220;To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi.&#8221; More than one Elvis ornament winks from the branches of the tree, and &#8220;the King&#8221; is joined by ornaments celebrating B.B. King, Robert Johnson, Archie Manning&#8217;s #18 jersey, and the Stennis Space Center. Decorations of Mississippi crops and products like Pine-Sol and Barq&#8217;s root beer recall our local industries. Clay recreations of some of Faulkner&#8217;s classic works, including The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, and Absalom, Absalom! hang next to a fuzzy bear with the date November 14, 1902, when big game hunter and then-President Theodore Roosevelt refused to shoot a tied up black bear near Onward, inspiring the creation of the Teddy Bear. Dozens of other ornaments made from wood, fabric, plaster, ceramics, and 3D-printed plastics capture what makes Mississippi so unique. The icons and stories of the Magnolia State tell our story, and the students, faculty, and staff at Petal High School have demonstrated that our traditions in the creative and visual arts are alive and well. It Is More Blessed to Give Than to Receive  The tree and beautiful decorations in my office are also reminders of all the families who celebrate Christmas by gathering together with loved ones around their own trees. Many of those families have made enormous sacrifices this year. In particular, I think about the stalwart and dedicated men and women in our armed forces who are not able to return home because they are safeguarding American interests overseas. I was glad to join with many of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle recently at a &#8220;Holiday Mail for Heroes&#8221; event in the Capitol to sign cards thanking troops deployed around the world and reminding them that they are loved here at home. The example of our military calls each of us to find our own ways large and small to serve in our daily lives. I am proud of my staff in Jackson which, for the last 10 years, has donated to the United States Marine Corps&#8217; Toys for Tots program. I was also joined by many of my grandchildren recently in ringing the bell for the Salvation Army in Jackson. Mississippians have a long history of volunteerism and giving back to their communities. That spirit of charity makes this season more merry and bright. As Christ taught us, &#8220;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8221;  Other news this week:  Wicker Votes to Fund the Government  Wicker Responds to House Impeachment Vote  Wicker Celebrates Passage of the National Defense Bill  Wicker Celebrates Senate Passage of Legislation to Promote Physical Activity     &nbsp;    Follow me on Facebook for daily updates  Follow me on Instagram&nbsp;for behind the scenes photos&nbsp;  Follow me on Twitter for my most recent statements   Unsubscribe to future eNewsletters here.

I also had the chance to meet with veterans of the Vietnam War and thank them for their service, hold a roundtable conversation on my fight to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and meet with advocates for clean drinking water.  Defending the Constitution  This week, guided by facts, the Constitution, and my conscience, I cast two votes&nbsp;to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and uphold our system of checks and balances. This was a solemn and serious week for our country that the President of the United States has brought this upon us. I cannot and will not stand idly by when a President compromises the rule of law and our national security for his own personal political benefit. The President has abused the powers of the highest office in the land and obstructed Congress when it sought to put facts on the table for the American people and hold him accountable. It is clear that Constitutional lines have been crossed, and to vote against these articles would dishonor the wisdom of our founders and undermine the institutions of our democracy.  The people of New Hampshire sent me to Congress to change how Washington works and to make a difference in the lives of families across the district that I&#8217;ve called home my entire life.&nbsp; And I will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to lower the cost of prescription drugs, rebuild our nation&#8217;s infrastructure, protect our drinking water, and ensure that veterans get the care and services they have earned. We have more work to do, and I committed to bringing people together around solutions. H.R. 3 - Lowering the cost of prescription drugs        Congressman Pappas meets with patients, advocates, and health care providers for a roundtable conversation on the cost of prescription drugs in Manchester after his vote to pass H.R. 3.&nbsp;    When I travel around New Hampshire asking constituents what's on their minds, there's no topic more urgent or more personal, than combating the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. I've heard from a senior who is unable to retire because his life is dependent on drugs that cost $3,000 a month out of pocket. I've heard from a mother who shares a painful chronic condition with her daughter, and has to decide every month whose prescription to fill, because she can't fill both on her fixed income.&nbsp; I was proud to support this legislation, which makes historic reforms to drive down to costs of prescription drugs, while expanding and strengthening Medicare &#8211; and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to put this to a vote and send it to President Trump&#8217;s desk for his signature. America is counting on us.&nbsp; I was also pleased that my provision to cut red tape and improve access to prescription drugs for seniors, was included in the final bill. Read more about that effort in the Union Leader here.  The National Defense Authorization Act&nbsp;  PFAS contamination is a real threat to families in my district, and I am proud to have worked alongside my colleagues for months to help craft an NDAA that supplies much-needed funding to our military, keeps our country safe, and corrects a long-standing inequity for our federal workers at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. I am also proud that several PFAS-related provisions did make it into the final legislation. That said, I am disappointed that certain provisions to protect public health and our environment were abandoned by negotiators of both parties. We need action now, and I will continue to work with colleagues to pass legislation that will bring about a stronger federal response. Congress should have seized the opportunity to go much further in protecting families and communities from these &#8216;forever chemicals,&#8217; and I will not stop in pursuing stronger action on PFAS contamination.&#8221; A breakthrough compromise on trade  Trade with Canada and Mexico is critical to the success of New Hampshire&#8217;s economy, and I was pleased that after months of negotiations the U.S. Trade Representative and Congressional leaders reached an agreement that will support our workers and continue to move our country forward. The revised USMCA fundamentally strengthens labor enforcement and will allow us to improve access to lower-cost prescription drugs for Americans. This agreement provides our businesses with the certainty and predictability they need. I am glad the House passed the re-negotiated North American Free Trade Agreement which will strengthen labor standards, protect American jobs, and safeguard Granite Stater&#8217;s access to affordable prescription drugs.&nbsp; Safeguarding New Hampshire&#8217;s infrastructure&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We are coming up on one of the busiest travel periods of the year. As Granite Staters pack up their cars and hit the roads to travel for the holidays, it is more important than ever that those highways are safe and that projects to rebuild and maintain them continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#8217;s why when a budget gimmick from the last highway funding bill threatened to rescind nearly $40 million in highway funding for New Hampshire, I knew we needed to move fast to protect these jobs and avoid project delays. I worked with Rep. Don Young, a Republican from Alaska, to organize over 100 of our House colleagues to call on Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader McCarthy to take action.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pleased that we were able to get a repeal of this funding recission in included in the budget resolution last month which ensured New Hampshire kept the funds we were owned and projects continued.&nbsp; Watch this story from WMUR about my effort to safeguard these funds.  Constituent Stories: Blue Heron Wines        Congressman Pappas visiting Blue Heron Wines in Newfields    Bob and Bill founded Blue Heron Wines in Newfields seven years ago. What started as a vineyard with 28 vines now has over 2,500. They made a decision early on that they weren&#8217;t going to bring in grapes or juice from other parts of the world. They said &#8220;No, we&#8217;re going to be local.&#8221;&nbsp; A wine label needs to be approved by a federal agency for a bottle to be sold. One of Blue Heron&#8217;s labels was rejected several times. They repeatedly appealed until finally the issue was resolved. But one day the same label was rejected again for the same issue that they had previously been told was taken care of. The clock was ticking. Blue Heron&#8217;s main source of revenue at this time was from farmer&#8217;s markets, and missing the markets meant they would not receive any revenue on their product. They called TTB and never heard back. Bill and Bob kept leaving messages and getting the runaround. &#8220;I&#8217;m calling Pappas,&#8221; said Bob.

Senator Scott also honored the victims in a speech on the Senate floor.&nbsp;  Watch Senator Scott&#8217;s speech and read his full remarks as prepared for delivery below.    Today, we come together to honor the courage of our brave men and women in uniform &#150; our heroes &#150; and to remember the victims of the tragic terrorist attack that took place at Naval Air Station Pensacola on the morning of Friday, December 6th.  I&#8217;d like to thank my colleagues, Senators Rubio, Perdue, Isakson, Shelby, and Jones for standing with me today as we honor the sacrifice and memory of the 3 victims and their families: Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, known to friends and family as &#8220;Mo,&#8221; just 19-years-old from St. Petersburg, Florida, a great athlete who loved to make others laugh. Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson of Enterprise, Alabama, a 23-year-old natural born leader and selfless volunteer who lifted others up. Joshua died a hero after giving first responders information on the shooter&#8217;s location while he was mortally wounded. And Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters of Richmond Hill, Georgia, just 21-years-old with a contagious smile whose dream was to serve his country. Our sailors and law enforcement officials showed heroism and bravery in the face of evil as they ran towards the shooter that day, saving lives.  And our first responders, who came to the swift aid of those in need: thank you. Today, the State of Florida stands united around the community of Pensacola and the families of the victims as we pray for healing. And I join my colleagues as we do everything we can to prevent future terrorist attacks. Thank you.              Sen. Rick Scott Commemorates 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and Luxembourg    Over the weekend,&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott joined a bipartisan Senate delegation to Belgium and Luxembourg to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. On Monday, the Senators joined members of the House of Representatives at an official ceremony at the Mardasson Memorial near Bastogne, Belgium to mark the occasion. Senator Scott also joined his colleagues in introducing a resolution honoring the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, which passed the Senate last week.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Seventy-five years ago, American soldiers &#150; including my father &#150; joined our Allies to fight evil and free Europe from the yoke of tyranny.&nbsp;It was an honor to join my colleagues in Belgium and Luxembourg to&nbsp;honor the sacrifices made by so many freedom-loving people in support of this cause.&nbsp;We will never forget their sacrifice, and the United States will always stand up for freedom and democracy.&#8221;&nbsp; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Gary Peters Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect K-12 School Systems from Cyber-Attacks  Senators Rick Scott and Gary Peters introduced the K-12 Cybersecurity Act of 2019, bipartisan legislation to implement stronger cybersecurity protections for K-12 educational institutions across the country.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;The safety of our schools is always my top priority, and that includes protecting the information of our students and teachers. I&#8217;m proud to sponsor the K-12 Cybersecurity Act of 2019 to further protect our schools, students and educators, and give them the resources they need to stay safe.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Peters' office&nbsp;HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Military Officers Should Be Allowed to Carry Firearms on U.S. Military Bases  In the wake of the tragic terrorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola, and&nbsp;calls from Navy pilots&nbsp;to change current policy, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;It defies logic that our men and women in uniform, who we train to operate multi-million dollar pieces of military equipment and trust to keep our country safe, are not allowed to carry firearms on U.S. military bases. It&#8217;s time for this policy to change. The terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola shows that it&#8217;s more important than ever for our men and women in uniform to be in a position to defend themselves. I will work with the leadership of the Armed Services Committees and the Department of Defense to see what needs to be done to change this policy and allow military officers to carry firearms on U.S. military bases.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Releases Letter to the Editor of Chinese-Controlled Global Times  Senator Rick Scott released the following letter to the editor in response to The Global Times&#8217; recent editorial attacking him for defending freedom and democracy in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Senator Scott submitted the letter to the editor of The Global Times, a news outlets under the control of the Communist Party of China, but has so far not heard back.

Rick Scott Applauds Final Passage of National Defense Authorization&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott applauded the Senate&#8217;s final passage of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes:   Nearly $750 billion in defense spending;&nbsp; A 3.1% pay raise for military members; Senator Scott&#8217;s amendment to cut off funds to the Maduro regime; Senator Scott&#8217;s amendment to hold China accountable;&nbsp; More than $1.5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael; and A ban on the purchase or use of foreign-made drones by the Department of Defense.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad Congress made our men and women in uniform a priority by finally passing the NDAA, which includes nearly $750 billion to fund our military and gives them the resources they need to defend our nation. I fought to include more than $1.5 billion in funding to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base and a pay raise for military members, as well as my proposals to hold China accountable and prohibit the DOD from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduro&nbsp;regime. I&#8217;m incredibly proud these priorities were included in the final NDAA, and I will always do everything I can to support our military and its mission to protect our nation, support our allies and stand up for freedom across the globe.&#8221; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Government Misfires in Funding the Arts&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott released an episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money. See previous Washington Waste Wednesday features HERE.  This week's episode focuses on what happens when Washington gets involved in the arts &#150; waste and misuse of taxpayer dollars. We all can support research and appreciate the arts, but the federal government spends $300 million a year on arts and humanities, including funding expensive projects that don&#8217;t provide any return on investment for taxpayers.  For example, this year&#8217;s spending bills include $25 million for the &#8220;operation, maintenance and security&#8221; of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and a $7.25 million increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest increase in a decade. These spending increases might be nice to have, but with $23 trillion in national debt, Congress needs to make some tough choices.

This investigation was the direct result of a letter Senator Scott sent this month to Florida university presidents urging them to protect national security by safeguarding U.S. research from Communist China. Senator Rick Scott&nbsp;said, &#8220;I applaud Lee Moffitt and the board of directors of Florida&#8217;s H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute for their proactive leadership in taking swift and decisive action against these individuals, who had an improper and undisclosed relationship with the Communist Chinese government. According to the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee, the Thousand Talents Program &#8216;incentivizes individuals engaged in research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and research they gain here to China in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives.&#8217; We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China and its attempts to steal U.S. research and intellectual property. We have to remain vigilant and proactive, and I will to continue to work with universities, hospitals and businesses to make sure they are protected.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.&nbsp;  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott Response to House Impeachment  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the House vote on impeachment.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;The House Democrats just spent a month confirming that the President did nothing wrong and that this impeachment circus is nothing but partisan politics. This vote solidifies how little the Democrats care about what&#8217;s really important to the American people. It&#8217;s clear all they care about are political games. This is sad and embarrassing, but I came to Washington to get something done for the American people. I look forward to getting back to working on all the things that aren&#8217;t getting done, like passing No Budget, No Pay, securing the border, and lowering drug prices for American families.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Marsha Blackburn and Colleagues Urge Response to National Security Threats Posed by Chinese Drones  Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Marsha Blackburn, Marco Rubio, John Cornyn and Tom Cotton in a letter to Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration leadership asking them to protect national security and stop using drones made in Communist China.

Human Rights Council and the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp;Read more, including the full letter, from Senator Hawley's office HERE.&nbsp;              Sen. Rick Scott: Merry Christmas, Here&#8217;s How Congress is About to Waste Your Money  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for National Review about the $1.4 trillion, 2,313 page-long spending package that Congress voted on this week.  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;This week, Congress is set to vote on a giant spending package &#151; 2,313 pages long &#151; that was just released, was negotiated in secret, spends $1.4 trillion, and is chock full of member projects and special-interest giveaways.  To put that number in context: Without any opportunity to read the bill, Congress will vote to spend more than $4,200 for every man, woman, and child in America. That&#8217;s on top of the $23 trillion in debt we&#8217;ve already accumulated, not to mention that the federal government is already running a trillion-dollar deficit, every year.&#133;  And let&#8217;s not forget. This bill spends $1.4 trillion, with no cuts or reforms.  This is not how Washington is supposed to work.&#133;  But one simple idea that we can get done right now is No Budget, No Pay. If Congress can&#8217;t pass a budget and appropriations bills in a timely and orderly fashion, members of Congress shouldn&#8217;t get a paycheck. You don&#8217;t get paid if you don&#8217;t do your job. Why should Congress?  It&#8217;s time to stop the madness. How many more trillions of dollars do we need to spend before we wake up to the danger of our national debt?  We need to reform the way Washington works, and we need to do it now.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in the National Review HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott Leads Colleagues in Urging Congressional Leadership to Pass No Budget, No Pay  Senator Rick Scott and Senator Kyrsten Sinema led a bipartisan, bicameral to Congressional leadership urging them to pass No Budget, No Pay to prevent members of Congress from getting paid if they don&#8217;t pass a budget.&nbsp;  Read more in the Fox Business article, Lawmakers from both parties rally around 'no budget no pay' ahead of deadline: &nbsp; &#8220;Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are once again rallying around the idea of &#8216;no budget, no pay&#8217; before a stopgap&nbsp;spending&nbsp;bill expires on Friday.&#133;  Scott urged his fellow lawmakers to pass \"No Budget, No Pay\" legislation&nbsp;in a Fox News&nbsp;op-ed&nbsp;written with Republican Sens. Steve Daines, of Montana, and Mike Braun, of Indiana, last week.  \"&#8217;If Congress can&#8217;t do its most basic task, then members of Congress shouldn&#8217;t get a paycheck,&#8217; they wrote. &#8216;Not only is this common sense, it's moving through Congress with bipartisan support.

It will be our last issue in the U.S. Senate before my retirement at the end of 2019. Every day since I was first sworn in to the U.S. Senate on Jan. 4, 2005, it has been a privilege to serve Georgia in this role. I&#8217;ve done my very best to make sure Georgians&#8217; best interests are reflected in my votes and policy work.  During these last several months since I announced my retirement, I&#8217;ve taken time to thank my staff, friends, supporters and family. Without them, we would not have reached the level of success we&#8217;ve achieved thus far, nor would it have been as gratifying. The relationships we have built have been so meaningful, and I will carry them with me always.  Traveling our beautiful state and working with Georgians from Rabun Gap to Tybee Light to represent commonsense, conservative values and deliver meaningful results has been a joy, regardless of the political climate or season. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the opportunity of a lifetime. In the Senate  At the time of this writing, the U.S. House passed two bills on Tuesday&nbsp;packaging together the 12 full-year appropriations bills to fund the government for fiscal year 2020, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measures later this week.  Several&nbsp;provisions I supported to help Georgians are included in the final measures:   Full funding for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for fiscal year 2020 to keep this number one economic development project for our state on track. The Hurricanes Florence and Michael and California Wildfire Tax Relief Act, to provide relief to victims of Hurricane Michael and other natural disasters from 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Preserving America&#8217;s Battlefields Act to help ensure our nation&#8217;s living memorials honoring those who fought for our freedoms are protected for current and future generations. The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, called the SECURE Act, to improve retirement preparations, encourage saving for retirement and help ensure hardworking Americans can plan in advance so they do not outlive their retirement savings. Funding for new resources to modernize public health data collection at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and across the country. Permanent repeal of Obamacare&#8217;s taxes on medical devices and health insurance, protecting consumers from the cost of these taxes and removing a burden on innovators and American manufacturers in the life sciences sector.  Improvements for Veterans  One of the areas I&#8217;m most proud of during my time in the U.S. Senate is our work on behalf of our nation&#8217;s proud veterans. During the last five years while I have been chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs, we have fundamentally changed the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to be more responsive to the veterans it serves. I am proud of how far we have come, and I hope the committee will continue this progress to ensure veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve. Since 2015, the Senate has passed nearly 60 pieces of legislation that originated in our committee to improve accountability at the VA, expand VA education benefits, modernize the process for veterans&#8217; appeals of benefit determinations, and overhaul the VA&#8217;s community care programs. You can read more about our work here. Commitment to Education  Our children are the message we send to the future, so whether it&#8217;s been in the Georgia general assembly, the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate or as chairman of the Georgia Board of Education, I&#8217;ve worked on education issues to help better the lives of future generations.      This week, we released the latest video in a series focusing on my career. I want to thank my colleagues who contributed to the video and everyone who has helped me better serve our young people through improved education policy. What&#8217;s On Tap?  In early January, Senator-designate Kelly Loeffler will be sworn in to the seat I have occupied in the U.S. Senate.&nbsp; This will be our final e-Newsletter. However, I look forward to remaining as active as possible in Georgia after my retirement from the U.S. Senate on Dec. 31.  Thank you again for this honor of a lifetime.

Maine Astronaut Jessica Meir Speaks with Senator Collins from the International Space Station Following her successful completion of the first all-female spacewalk, Dr. Jessica Meir, a native of Caribou, spoke with Senator Collins by phone aboard the International Space Station.&nbsp; Senator Collins congratulated Dr. Meir on her historic achievement and asked about her experiences in space thus far.&nbsp; The Senate unanimously passed a resolution introduced by Senators Collins and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and cosponsored by all 23 of their female colleagues congratulating Dr. Meir and her fellow astronaut, Christina Koch, on their accomplishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;      Portland Veteran Tells Senator Collins&#8217; Committee about His Successful Efforts to Protect Fellow Veteran from being Scammed   When Ben Wells of Portland completed his service in the Air Force, he wanted to find a way to give back to his community while applying for doctoral programs.&nbsp; He did not anticipate that he would once again end up on the frontlines, this time in the fight against scams.&nbsp; At the invitation of Chairman Collins, Ben testified before the Senate Aging Committee about how he prevented a Korean War veteran and his wife from being victimized by two con artists seeking to rob them of their hard-earned savings.&nbsp; Click HERE to read more about Ben&#8217;s story.      Bipartisan Legislation Introduced by Senator Collins to Address Growing Crisis of Drug Shortages   In 2018, there were more than 200 drug shortages in the U.S., and that number continues to rise. Unavailable medications result in delayed or cancelled treatments, creating severe anxiety for patients. A kidney and bladder cancer patient in Portland recently told Senator Collins about how a lack of BCG is stopping him from receiving preventive treatments his doctor recommended now that he is in remission.&nbsp; Shortages also put time and cost pressures on hospital staff, who must scramble to find alternatives.&nbsp; For instance, MaineHealth is currently managing 40 shortages. Earlier this year, the hospital was forced to switch to a medication that cost ten times more than the drug that was out of stock.&nbsp; In a bipartisan effort to increase the supplies of vital drugs, Senator Collins joined Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) in introducing the Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages (MEDS) Act.&nbsp; It would expedite the review of drugs in shortage and strengthen manufacturers&#8217; reporting requirements, among other provisions.&nbsp; Senator Collins recently met with MaineHealth Chief Pharmacy Officer Brian Marden, who spoke at a panel discussion highlighting the importance of passing this bill. &#8220;Drug shortages, unfortunately, remain a significant barrier in delivering optimal and safe patient care,&#8221; Dr. Marden said.&nbsp; &#8220;It is critically important to share these challenges and continuously educate so that we can advance national strategies that have a true impact on remedying drug shortages and lead to a more predictable and sustainable drug supply in this country.&#8221; Click HERE to read more.    Senator Collins Presses FDA, CDC Officials to Step Up Response to Youth Vaping In the last 30 days, more that 27 percent of high schoolers and 10.5 percent of middle schoolers reported vaping according to the latest National Youth Tobacco Survey. In response to the alarming rise of e-cigarette use among children, Senator Collins, a member of the Health Committee, pressed FDA and CDC officials to bolster their efforts to protect public health at a recent hearing. Senator Collins raised her concern with Mitch Zeller, the Director of the Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA, and Dr. Anne Schuchat, the Principal Deputy Director at the CDC, that according to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, teens who began using e-cigarettes are more likely to start smoking conventional cigarettes.&nbsp; She also asked Dr. Schuchat to describe the specific resources available to schools to highlight the dangers of vaping. Senator Collins previously announced her support of the FDA&#8217;s plan to ban flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, and she is a cosponsor of a bill to remove flavored vaping products from the market as well as legislation to prevent online sales of e-cigarettes to minors.    $44.6 Million for Two Maine Transportation Projects Announced by Senator Collins Maine will receive a total of $44.6 million for two transportation projects following the advocacy of Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee.&nbsp; Out of the hundreds of applications that the U.S. Department of Transportation received for this year&#8217;s BUILD grants, Maine&#8217;s projects were two of only 55 projects across the country that were selected through this highly competitive grant program. The funding includes: 1)&nbsp;$25 million for the replacement of the aging Station 46 Bridge on U.S. Route 1 in Woolwich, a vital commuter and tourism corridor. 2)&nbsp;$19.6 million for the Town of Lubec to build a safe harbor to protect boats and fishermen in inclement weather and help fishermen get their catch to market more quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to thank our Congressional representatives - including Senator Collins - for their ongoing commitment to funding transportation infrastructure improvements in Maine,&#8221; said MaineDOT Commissioner Bruce Van Note.&nbsp; &#8220;This support from our federal partners continues to be a big part of how we fund our annual work plan.&#8221; Senator Collins has secured $593 million for Maine transportation projects since joining the Appropriations Committee in 2009.    ConservAmerica Honors Senator Collins with Congressional Champion Award for Her Leadership on Conservation &amp; Clean Energy Initiatives   ConservAmerica, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of sound environmental and conservation policy, bestowed its Congressional Champion of 2019 Award on Senator Collins at the group&#8217;s annual dinner.&nbsp; Senator Collins was honored for her leadership in conservation and clean energy initiatives.&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;ConservAmerica&#8217;s hard work and dedication are helping to preserve our nation&#8217;s stunning beauty for the enjoyment of all and to support America&#8217;s economy,&#8221; said Senator Collins.&nbsp; &#8220;I am grateful for this recognition and will continue my long-standing efforts to support and strengthen vital conservation programs, such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund.&#8221; Senator Collins has been a champion for protecting our environment.&nbsp; Some of her recent accomplishments include her successful advocacy to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund&#151;our country&#8217;s most important and successful conservation program&#151;and authoring the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act to promote energy storage technology for renewable energy.&nbsp; Click HERE to read more about Senator Collins&#8217; work to ensure that everyone can enjoy the beauty of natural resources in Maine and across the country.    Senator Collins Presents Distinguished Flying Cross Award to Vietnam War Veteran   While on a mission in Vietnam on June 13, 1969, Major Charles McClead, USAF, Ret., guided his aircraft through heavy enemy fire to successfully destroy two gun positions. He was notified that he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his courage and skill, but never received his medal.&nbsp;Five decades later, Major McClead reached out to Senator Collins&#8217; Bangor Constituent Service Center and requested assistance in obtaining his award.&nbsp; Senator Collins contacted the Department of Defense on his behalf and forwarded them the necessary documents.&nbsp; On Veterans Day, she hosted a ceremony at the Cole Land Transportation Museum in Bangor to formally present Major McClead with his medal.&nbsp; The event was attended by Major McClead&#8217;s family as well as Major General Douglas A. Farnham, the Adjutant General of the Maine National Guard; Senior Master Sergeant Stanley Niedorowski of the Maine National Guard; and several other community leaders.&nbsp;&#8220;One of the best parts of my job is helping a veteran receive a long-overdue medal,&#8221; said Senator Collins.&nbsp; &#8220;We owe Major McClead and all of our veterans a great debt for the sacrifices they have made to preserve our freedom.&#8221;&nbsp;Major McClead flew a total of 220 combat missions during the Vietnam War, and he served in the Air Force for more than two decades. &nbsp;Click HERE to read more about Major McClead.

Dear Friends:  With the bulk of the Intelligence Committee&#8217;s work on impeachment behind us, Thanksgiving week provided me with a good opportunity for rest and reflection. I thought a lot about the privilege it is to serve the people of the 10th Congressional District and to be one of only approximately 12,000 people in our Republic&#8217;s history to serve in the US House. This is important work and there are many parts to the job I deeply love.  I have loved:   handing the long overdue Purple Heart to the deserving soldier whose serious injuries had been overlooked by the authorities. Indeed, I loved advocating for all the service members and veterans who populate the District; forming the State Road 167 Coalition to successfully fight for completion of this critical roadway; standing up the Puget Sound Caucus with my friend and roommate, Derek Kilmer, and moving the needle on saving the Sound; leading the Congress on reauthorization of the job-creating Export Import Bank; writing the New Democrats&#8217; Housing Task Force Report which helped to finally throw a spotlight on the national housing crisis; working on issues with Indian Country such as renaming the Nisqually Wildlife Refuge for my friend Billy Frank, Jr. and reauthorizing the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act; and the honor of serving on the House Intelligence Committee and being entrusted with our nation&#8217;s most sensitive security secrets.  Heck, I even loved becoming one of the House&#8217;s foremost monetary policy experts. How nerdy is that?  The opportunity to work on these issues and others was only possible through the support and good graces of the people of the district. I am eternally grateful to them. And I am equally grateful to the outstanding staff who have been a hard working and living testament to the promise of America&#8217;s future.  It is incredible work but it takes its toll. Being away so much from Paula, my best friend and wife of nearly 44 years, can be lonely even when I am in a crowded room. At our age, however many &#8220;good years&#8221; we have left together is not a growing number.  In the spirit of complete openness, part of me is also discouraged. The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary. I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the President&#8217;s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.  As has been observed, however, to some degree he is a symptom and not the cause or at least the only cause. The truth is that civic discourse began degrading before him. At times, it is as though there are no rules or boundaries. Success seems to be measured by how many Twitter followers one has which are largely gained by saying increasingly outrageous things, the more personal the better. There are simply too many hyperbolic adjectives and too few nouns. Civility is out. Compromise is out. All or nothing is in.  None of this discouragement in any way diminishes the bone-deep gratitude I feel for the privilege to serve in Congress and for all who have made this incredible journey possible &#8212; my family, the voters of the 10th District, my staff and all the countless people who have extended a thousand kindnesses along the way. So, unless it hasn&#8217;t been clear enough: Thank you! But it is time for me to retire.  I make this decision completely confident that there will be outstanding people step forward to take up the challenge to represent this beautiful corner of our great land. My only wish is that whomever emerges will remember the eternal wisdom of my former colleague John Dingell who was the longest serving member of the House in US history (59 years and 21 days) and who recently passed away. He would tell all incoming freshmen smart enough to seek his advice: &#8220;You have a very important job, a VERY important job . . . and you&#8217;re not a very important person.&#8221;  John taught us that we don&#8217;t &#8220;have&#8221; power but that we hold it in trust. It has been a privilege to hold this trust the last many years.  I promise to &#8220;run through the tape&#8221; until the end of my term and continue to work hard and give it my best. But after that, Paula awaits as well as at least two books I will write. And more movies and sleep and time at the cabin. Washington State so has it over Washington, D.C.  Finally, after more than 40 years of intermittent public service, know this: I got more out of it than I gave it, and I gave it all I had.

Following the observance of Veterans Day, I took to the floor of the United States Senate to recognize and honor veterans in Colorado and across the United States who have served our country in uniform. There has never been a fight too dangerous or a task too difficult for the men and women who have served our country. We must approach veterans care with the same commitment, and find creative solutions to ease the transition to civilian life and ensure they receive the best possible care. To everyone who has served, thank you for every sacrifice you have made, and know that our nation is grateful. It is because of our veterans&#8217; commitment that we can continue to live in a nation with unlimited opportunities.  Olympians Deserve a Say in the USOPC Structure   Click here or the photo above to view Senator Gardner's remarks.  My bipartisan&nbsp;legislation to evaluate the structure of the United States&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;Committee was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. This common-sense bill would create a 16-member commission, half of whom would be Olympians or Paralympians, to examine what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not and report back to Congress with their findings, conclusions, recommendations, and any suggested&nbsp;policy changes.&nbsp;In Colorado we are proud of our&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;City, Colorado Springs, and all that our&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;athletes mean to our great state. But we know that we can do better. This will help the U.S.&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;Committee&#8217;s presence in Colorado grow even stronger and make sure we do a better job looking out for the futures of our&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;and Paralympic athletes.  Championing Conservation   As co-chair of the Roosevelt Conservation Caucus, I was honored to receive the &#8220;Congressional Champion&#8221; award from ConservAmerica for my work in Congress to preserve and protect the great outdoors. Every American should want to protect the environment and pass our beautiful country on to the next generation better and cleaner than it was given to us. In Colorado, we take pride in being responsible stewards of the environment and our state&#8217;s abundant and diverse natural resources. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance innovative, economically viable policies to improve our environment and make sure the American people continue to have the highest quality of life possible. Measuring the Impact of Colorado&#8217;s Great Outdoors Outdoor recreation has always been part of who we are in Colorado. It's a pillar of our local communities and Western heritage, and draws people from all over the world to enjoy our beautiful state and its great outdoors. But until recently, the federal government did not study the economic impact of outdoor recreation. That changed when President Obama signed the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act or \"Outdoor REC Act\" in 2016, authored by myself and Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). In September, the government released the findings of its first-ever state-level measurements of outdoor recreation's economic impact. Read more about why this matters for Colorado and our great outdoors in my latest op-ed in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel.  Bipartisan Bill to Protect Firefighters Advances in the Senate My bipartisan bill with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to examine and address health concerns regarding firefighters&#8217; exposure to PFAS chemicals passed unanimously in the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Our firefighters and emergency responders in Colorado and around the country risk everything to protect our communities, and it is our duty to make sure we have accurate research to understand and mitigate any dangerous per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure during emergency response and training activities. Our bipartisan legislation will authorize a study through the National Institute of Standards and Technology to examine the concentration of PFAS in firefighters&#8217; protective gear and take steps to reduce or eliminate the possibility of any dangerous PFAS exposure. Researching Opioid Addiction The opioid epidemic is devastating communities across the nation and has ruined too many lives in Colorado. There&#8217;s no one solution to ending this crisis, but promoting research to better understand the epidemic and encouraging the development of new tools and treatments for opioid addiction and abuse are meaningful steps. I&#8217;m proud to see the Senate Commerce Committee approve the EFFORT Act, my bipartisan legislation with Senator Chris Coons (D-DE), which will support research efforts at the National Science Foundation so we can base policy on evidence and work to stop the cycle of opioid addiction.  NASA and Colorado&#8217;s Leadership in Space&nbsp; The bipartisan NASA Authorization Act of 2019 moved forward in the Senate with my support and several provisions I secured. Colorado has positioned itself as a hub of space exploration, and I&#8217;m proud to work at the federal level to bolster Coloradans&#8217; efforts. I successfully included an amendment in the NASA reauthorization to look at creating a NASA center for excellence for space weather technology, an area where Colorado has been a leader. Our state has one of the largest aerospace sectors, and I&#8217;ll continue to support the critical work our men and women are doing and advocate for policies that ensure Colorado and the United States remain the world&#8217;s leader in space exploration.&nbsp; Need Help with a Federal Agency?&nbsp; My staff is available to assist you with finding out the status of a case and requesting additional information from a federal agency.

(Vermont Youth Rally for the Planet Young people understand the urgency of addressing climate change, as they will be the generation most affected by its devastating consequences. Hundreds of Vermont students rallied recently at the Statehouse, demanding bold action to address this planetary crisis. I am proud that our state's youth are joining young people around the world and speaking out on this critical issue. Real change only happens when people organize at the grassroots. And I am proud of young Vermonters for doing just that. I hope they continue to hold politicians and the fossil fuel industry accountable. We must act, and we must act now. Video (-------------------------------------------------- Remembering the Fallen On Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who gave their lives in service to our country. Some lost their lives on the battlefield and many, many more died of injuries to body and mind once they returned home. On this day, we also recognize the tremendous sacrifice of our Gold Star families - the spouses, parents, siblings and children of the fallen. To my mind, the best way to honor the fallen - not just on Memorial Day but every day - is to make sure that all veterans and family members receive the services and benefits they earned. While serious people can disagree in good faith about when our country should go to war, there should never be a debate over whether we fulfill the promises made to the men and women who have served in our military.

Student debt is weighing down the lives of millions of college graduates--who can't pursue their dream job or are putting off buying a house or even starting a family. Many other countries provide free college tuition and their young people aren't saddled with enormous student loan debt. Students in Vermont and across this country deserve no less.

So far, about one-third of the extraordinarily beautiful trail is complete, and area businesses already say they have seen a positive impact on their bottom lines. I am delighted I could secure more than $5 million in federal funds to get this project moving and I look forward to the trail's completion, which will eventually run for 93 miles from Swanton to St. Johnsbury.

Bandelier National Monument encapsulates each of these in unrivaled ways. That's why I am so proud to work with communities in northern New Mexico to introduce legislation to make Bandelier our nation's newest national park. This legislation has garnered widespread support from local communities throughout northern New Mexico and tribes across Indian Country. I announced the Bandelier National Park and Preserve Act yesterday, and was honored to have Santa Clara Pueblo Governor Michael Chavarria share his views on the legislation during a teleconference. I hope you can take a moment to listen to our comments on KSWV - Suave Radio. PHOTO: Alcove House in Frijoles Canyon in Bandelier National Monument. Bandelier's mesas and canyons have human history that dates back more than 10,000 years. The ancestral sites in Bandelier continue to hold deep cultural and religious significance to the pueblos. Creating this new national park is the best way to ensure Bandelier's cultural treasures and northern New Mexico's history and natural beauty receive the recognition and protection they have long deserved. Only Congress can create a national park and provide the highest level of protection for cultural resources, and Congress can ensure that a current or future president can't undo those protections. Many of our best-known national parks, like the Grand Canyon and Carlsbad Caverns, started as national monuments and were later upgraded to national park status by Congress. I believe it's long past time that we recognize that Bandelier's historical and natural resources are more than worthy of this same treatment. I encourage you to write to me about this and other issues important to you and your family.

We will continue to thank our heroes and&nbsp;their families and remember those who gave their last full measure of devotion in defense of our freedom.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Attending the Leehan Memorial Bridge dedication in Moore on Veterans Day was one of the highlights of this season for Cindy and me. The bridge was dedicated in the memory of Lt.

These students from Minco High School asked great questions and were very engaged.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Oklahoma Farm Bureau asked me to preach for their Sunday morning vespers to conclude their state meeting on November 10. It was a beautiful breakfast and a pleasure to see so manyfriends from around the state.    Dear Oklahoma friends and neighbors:  Happy Thanksgiving! Next week, most Oklahomans will get to enjoy at least a day of food and family traditions. As you sit down with your family and/or friends to enjoy this time of gratitude for the freedoms we have as Americans and for God&#8217;s many blessings, remember those serving our nation away from their families in law enforcement and the military. Please also consider giving to or volunteering to help others in need during this season.  Lately, several people have told me that they dread the inevitable Thanksgiving political argument around the table and in the kitchen. Just about every family has some political differences, but we should not allow our political differences to separate our families and friendships.&nbsp;  Let&#8217;s try something for Thanksgiving: turn off the news and turn on the gratitude.&nbsp;  There are so many good things to talk about in our state and nation. Find a family project to do, serve a neighbor in need, get outside, watch the parade, share old stories&#151;anything but bringing up more politics. Make the commitment to change the subject to something or someone you are grateful for every time someone brings up politics. Even though we have so many tough issues right now as a nation, maybe it would be helpful for all of us to take a break from the political noise and remember how much we have to be thankful for. A little more caring and a little less complaining sounds like a good recipe for Thanksgiving.  Government Funding through December  One of those ongoing, tough national conversations right now is the funding for our government. This week, Congress voted to once again delay the deadline until December 20 to fully fund the government through the passage of yet another continuing resolution (CR), a bill that extends funding at current levels. I supported the measure because, with the House&#8217;s preoccupation with the impeachment inquiry, Congress needs more time to consider and pass appropriations bills and consider government shutdown prevention legislation.  However, every CR has consequences. When our government has temporary funding, federal workers worry about a government shutdown, contracts cannot be completed, agency leaders spend all their time on short-term budgets, and costs go up for everyone. The government is open, but it is not working well. That is why I have worked for months to end government shutdowns and make sure short-term funding is really short term.  My bipartisan Prevent Government Shutdowns Act has already passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), and we are currently working to bring the bill to the finish line during the current federal spending conversation. Oklahoma is home to 45,868 federal employees. It&#8217;s time Congress, not the American people, were held responsible for our lack of action. We can continue to solve our debt and deficit issues and take government shutdowns off the table by forcing Members of Congress to stay in Washington until the work is done on federal spending.  CLICK HERE to watch my floor speech this week on our bill and on the current funding conversation in Washington.  UPDATE: Impeachment  Article 1, Section 2 of the US Constitution states, &#8220;The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.&#8221; Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution states, &#8220;The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.&#8221;  Just like the rest of the country, I am tracking the House impeachment hearings and testimony. But the Senate is not involved in the process unless the House chooses to impeach the President. If the House chooses to impeach the President, it will force a trial in the Senate. Until that time, I have plenty of work that needs to get finished. I sat down with one of the former Senate parliamentarians to talk about the Senate rules for impeachment on my latest podcast, the Breakdown with James Lankford. This is a deep dive into the quirky Senate impeachment rules and what you could expect if the House chooses to impeach President Trump.  CLICK HERE to listen to my fascinating conversation with former Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin about the impeachment and trial processes.  UPDATE: Border Security  Last week, I questioned officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Justice Department at a HSGAC hearing to obtain updates on immigration, learn more about the issues with state E-Verify participation, assess government immigration attorney shortages, and hear about ongoing border security issues including detention facility bed shortages.  Last July, I visited border security and immigration facilities along our southern border to see first-hand the overcrowding issues and apprehension processes for illegal crossings along our southern border. In addition to having an opportunity to thank our border law enforcement agencies and personnel directly, my Q&amp;A focused on how we must be ready for a potential surge at our borders this coming spring and summer.  CLICK HERE to watch my Q&amp;A.  Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s Visit to the White House  Last week, I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the visit of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to the White House. Numerous times over the last couple of years, I have publicly expressed my disappointment in the Turkish regime&#8217;s increasing relationship with Russia, particularly its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia, which is designed to take down the American F-35 aircraft. In October, I was outspoken in my support of President Trump&#8217;s announcement to issue sanctions on Turkey amid the aggression in the region, and I was pleased our government prevented Turkey from acquiring America&#8217;s modern F-35 jet.  CLICK HERE to watch my speech on our relationship with Turkey.  UPDATE: Election Security  Earlier this month, I questioned Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher&nbsp;Wray, Under Secretary for DHS Office of Intelligence&nbsp;and Analysis David J. Glawe, and Acting Director of National Counter Terrorism Center&nbsp;(NCTC) Russell Travers, during a HSGAC hearing on&nbsp;&#8220;Threats to the Homeland.&#8221; This annual hearing addresses some of the most pressing&nbsp;issues facing the nation&#8217;s national security and how FBI, NCTC, and DHS work together&nbsp;to thwart potential threats. I focused my Q&amp;A on DHS&#8217; responsibility to address election&nbsp;security.  CLICK HERE to watch my Q&amp;A on election security.  As I have said many times before, we need federal legislation to ensure each state can confidently and securely run their elections. Our states have already put in place most of the recommendations from my Secure Elections Act, so we are definitely in a better position for election security now than we were in 2016. But there is still more work to be done.  In addition to overall election security efforts, I recently worked with Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Gary Peters of Michigan, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin to introduce a bipartisan bill to strengthen local government cyber security defenses by switching to the .gov domain for websites and email addresses. The DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2019 directs DHS to provide resources and assistance to local governments wanting to adopt .gov web addresses.  The internet has become a main source of information, but you certainly can&#8217;t always trust what you read or see. Our bill expands the federal government&#8217;s ability to offer a city, state, county, or Tribal government the .gov domain, which will provide more communities access to safe, secure, online resources. Federal and state government agencies commonly use the .gov domain, but it is not widely used on a local level. This trusted domain increases resilience to cyber crimes that frequently target local government systems.  CLICK HERE to learn more about my bipartisan election cyber security bill.  Federal Fumbles is Coming!  In just over a week, our team will release our annual Federal Fumbles,&nbsp;our guide and solutions to federal inefficiency and government waste. We want to do more than complain about the waste; we want to put a spotlight on it and then fix it.            Keeping You in the Loop   On November 6, I met with Assistant Secretary for Army-Civil Works R.D. James to discuss civic projects and work at the US Army Corps of Engineers, with particular attention to the recent flooding in Green Country. In our meeting I had the opportunity to talk through flood control options and stress the importance of finding a solution to the chronic flooding issues in northeast Oklahoma. We also discussed land-lease issues in eastern Oklahoma and ways to improve all of the Corps processes for local communities and individuals. On November 4, Oklahoma City commemorated 168 days until the 25th anniversary of the tragic loss of 168 lives in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. As we move closer to the 25th anniversary, we should remember well what hatred can do to a community and continue to remember those we lost, those who survived, and those whose lives were changed forever. Let&#8217;s embody the Oklahoma Standard in our everyday lives. Please visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial website to get involved and to learn about our beautiful memorial and museum in OKC. If it has been a few years or if you have never been to the Memorial Museum, I would encourage you and your family to spend a day there to learn about that horrible day so that we #neverforget. On November 4, I led Members of Congress in an amicus brief to urge the US Supreme Court not to enforce a rule issued by Health and Human Services (HHS) during the Obama Administration that forces organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor to violate their religious beliefs.&nbsp;The Supreme Court has sided with the Little Sisters of the Poor twice. It&#8217;s time for the government to stop bullying the people who are actually doing good work for our nation and allow the Sisters to return to their vocation. CLICK HERE to read more about the case and my amicus brief. During the week of Veterans Day, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce the Protect Veterans&#8217; Education and Training Spending (Protect VETS) Act of 2019, which would protect military and veteran students by closing the 90/10 loophole and require for-profit schools to secure at least 10 percent of their revenues from sources other than taxpayers. More than two decades ago, President George H.W. Bush signed a bipartisan bill into law that limited how much federal funding for-profit schools may receive from taxpayers. Now called the 90/10 rule, this limit requires for-profit schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenues from non-federal sources. However, a loophole in the law excludes veteran and active duty education funds like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Tuition Assistance (TA) from being considered as federal funds. Some for-profit schools have exploited this loophole by using aggressive recruitment practices and deceptive marketing to enroll service members, veterans, and other GI Bill beneficiaries. The Protect VETS Act would close the 90/10 loophole by counting VA and DOD funds as federal dollars. This helps protect Vets from some for-profit schools that are taking advantage of them and it protects the taxpayer by forcing for-profit schools to find other sources of funds besides hard working tax payers. CLICK HERE for more information on this commonsense measure to fix the loophole. Last month, Senator Jacky Rosen from Nevada and I launched the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism. The mission of the Task Force will be to collaborate with law enforcement, federal agencies, state and local government, educators, advocates, clergy, and other stakeholders to combat anti-Semitism by educating and empowering our communities. Watch for more information on our work to combat Anti- Semitism together. CLICK HERE to read our op-ed about the Anti-Semitism Task Force. On November 13, Attorney General William Barr announced a new plan to combat gun violence in our nation known as Project Guardian. The plan enforces existing laws by setting federal law enforcement protocols for information sharing with state law enforcement to ensure individuals who legally are prohibited from owning, possessing, or purchasing a firearm are barred from doing so. I have cosponsored a bill called the NICS Denial Notification Act, which would require federal law enforcement to notify state law enforcement when an individual fails a NICS background check. Project Guardian would enforce similar guidelines as well as greater enforcement of gun revocations from convicted domestic violence offenders and better information sharing among state and federal law enforcement regarding mental health-related denials of firearms. I have also cosponsored the RESPONSE Act, which provides increased resources for law enforcement and mental health training, as well as school safety to address active shooter training. I remain a staunch Second Amendment advocate and believe enforcement of existing law, like Project Guardian, or clarifying legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and improve training for law enforcement are helpful as we confront gun violence in our nation. CLICK HERE to read the AG&#8217;s full memorandum on Project Guardian. Between the State of Oklahoma and our partners in federal agencies, we continue to work toward an overall reduction of opioid-related deaths by treating drug addiction and dependence and focus on the mental health aspects of both. After the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy visited eastern and central Oklahoma earlier this year, the Director shared data that shows Oklahoma has already seen a 1.4 percent overall decrease in overdose deaths - down but not by very much. All of us should help people we know who struggle with addiction of any type. I have met multiple times with the National Institutes of Health to encourage them to keep up their work to discover non-addictive pain treatment alternatives. CLICK HERE to watch the video. The Senate continues to work through Judicial and Executive Branch nominations, including several for courts and legal positions affecting Oklahoma. This week, the nomination of Judge Bernard M. Jones to serve as judge on the US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and now heads to the Senate floor. The Judiciary Committee also approved the nomination of Mrs. Jodi Dishman, a nominee to serve as a district court judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. Senator Inhofe and I were also both pleased to see President Trump&#8217;s nomination of John Heil to serve as judge on the US District Court for the Eastern, Northern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma. We will continue to work through these and other nominations through the advice and consent process in the Senate. CLICK HERE to read more about Bernard Jones. CLICK HERE to read more about Jodi Dishman I was recently joined by a bipartisan group of senators, including Senator Inhofe, to introduce the Harmless Error Lesser Penalty (HELP) for Small Businesses Act (S. 2757). This simple good government bill would waive fines for first-time paperwork violations by small businesses, excluding fines for violations that endanger the public health or safety, criminal activity, IRS enforcement, and issues that could cause harm to the public interest. Small businesses have difficulty wading through the vast quagmire of federal paperwork, so let&#8217;s give a little grace, instead of giving a fine for one small harmless paperwork error. CLICK HERE to learn more about the bill. Households will soon be able to respond to the 2020 Census online, over the phone, or through a paper questionnaire. Additionally, if you are interested in being a census-taker, the Census Bureau is working hard to recruit and hire local census takers from local communities. You can find more information on how to participate in the 2020 Census HERE. It is important for every Oklahoman to complete their Census form. I recently stopped by several Oklahoma City-based TV stations to talk through the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the impeachment inquiry in the House, our work on the Finance Committee to combat rising prescription drug prices, and other issues.

My team and I continue to work for you and our community. Here are some things we did this week:&nbsp;   With the Florida Delegation, I proudly led a letter&nbsp;advocating for modernized water quality allocation for our state to help fund local water projects and septic-to-sewer conversion I introduced a bipartisan bill to leverage university research to preserve Florida's coastline I co-sponsored the PAWS Act to help pair veterans with support dogs My colleagues and fellow Global War on Terror veterans and I ran in support of the Global War on Terror Memorial and toured potential memorial sites On Thursday, I participated in a service project landscaping and preserving the Korean War Veterans Memorial with a bipartisan group of congressmen and fellow veterans&nbsp;  FIGHTING FOR CLEAN WATER FOR FLORIDA:&nbsp;Last week, I proudly&nbsp;led a letter&nbsp;with 15 of my fellow Florida congressmen&nbsp;advocating for modernized water quality allocation for our state.&nbsp;The current allocation formula for federal funding hasn't been updated since 1987 and as a result, Florida received&nbsp;the third-lowest allotment per capita nationwide in 2019, despite having the third most-significant water infrastructure needs in the country. This is unacceptable! With a new formula, Florida could receive the appropriate funding needed&nbsp;to keep our water clean. Clean water is important to all Floridians and that's why I'm proud&nbsp;to lead the fight to ensure Florida receives the necessary funds to keep our water clean.&nbsp;  LEVERAGING UNIVERSITIES TO PRESERVE OUR COASTS:&nbsp;Floridians know how important our coasts are for our way of life. Unfortunately, our beautiful coasts are eroding due to flooding. We must use all the resources in our arsenal to preserve our coasts -- and one of those resources is our university system. Last week, Rep. Jimmy Panetta and&nbsp;I introduced a bipartisan bill&nbsp;to&nbsp;leverage research from coastal universities to preserve our coasts and our environment.&nbsp;Governor Ron DeSantis&nbsp;has already prioritized our environment at the state level by appointing both a Chief Science Officer and a Chief Resilience Officer and I'm committed to continuing the fight for Florida's environment at the federal level!    Our Daytona Beach Shores coastline  SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS: The effects of war on our service men and women aren't always visible -- and sadly, more veterans lose their lives to suicide than combat today. Our veterans deserve all the tools necessary to live happy, healthy lives. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m working with fellow Florida Congressman John Rutherford to co-sponsor the PAWS Act to pair veterans with support dogs. Support dogs help east the difficulties many veterans experience as they transition into civilian life. Support dogs help our veterans get out of bed each morning and slowly integrate them into society again. Dogs provide hope, love and purpose.This bill brings us one step closer to providing our veterans with the care they have earned and deserve!   &nbsp; Discussing the bipartisan PAWS Act and the benefit of support dogs for our veterans FIGHTING FOR GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR MEMORIAL:&nbsp;For veterans, families and our country, having a place where we can come together, heal and reflect is important.&nbsp;This week, I was proud to run with my colleagues and fellow Global War on Terror veterans on both sides of the aisle to the proposed memorial sites in support of the Global War on Terror Memorial.&nbsp;In such a divisive time, I am glad to join my fellow veterans of the Global War on Terror to advocate for a memorial honoring the service of the brave men and women of our generation.&nbsp;   Running with my fellow Global War on Terror veterans around the National Mall COMING TOGETHER TO HONOR OUR VETERANS:&nbsp;On Thursday, I gathered a bipartisan group of congressmen and fellow veterans to landscape and clean the Korean War Veterans Memorial. This memorial honors the nearly 5.8 million Americans who served in the Korean War. As I head back to our district to spend time with many of you and reflect on our blessings during Thanksgiving, I&#8217;m grateful we were able to set partisanship aside and pay tribute to our veterans and their sacrifices for freedom. Let us never forget our heroes.

Safe travels back to the Natural State!  The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Tribal Access to Homeless Assistance Act (, the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act (), the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act (), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (), the Investor Protection and Capital Markets Fairness Act (), the Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act (), the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Further Health Extenders Act (), a bill to extend the authorization for the Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission (), the Big Bear Land Exchange Act (), a bill to rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge as the Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge (), the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act (), the North American Wetlands Conservation Extension Act (), the First Infantry Recognition of Sacrifice in Theatre Act (), the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act (), a bill to rename the Homestead National Monument of America near Beatrice, Nebraska, as the Homestead National Historical Park (), the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Study Act (), the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (), a bill to prohibit the commercial export of covered munitions items to the Hong Kong Police Force (S. 2710), and the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act ().   One of Congress&#8217;s constitutional obligations - and essential functions - is to fund the federal government. That is supposed to mean passing 12 appropriations bills by the start of each fiscal year. FY2020 started on October 1st,&nbsp;and we have yet to do this. Instead, Congress has put forth continuing resolution after continuing resolution (CR), which extends previously set funding levels. The latest CR, which extends the next funding deadline to December 20th, was put on the floor this week. I voted against it because Congress should be doing its work now - not punting our responsibility another few weeks to right before Christmas.   We have had several weeks since the beginning of the new fiscal year to reconcile policy differences and fulfill our appropriations duties, but all Congress has to show for its work is another move to kick the can down the road. There is no reason why we should be waiting until December to address the issues we can be debating today. All this bill does is extend the ticking of the clock to another budget deadline, and I have no confidence that sitting on our hands will make discussions more productive in the coming weeks. My vote reflected the urgency to address these issues head-on now - not wait to take votes of desperation. We need to finish our work, not perpetuate the dysfunction of the legislative process. As I declared on the House floor, I&#8217;m extremely frustrated. Nobody conducts their business or personal finances the way Congress does. Furthermore, I think history has shown the reality of the situation. It is unlikely that we will conclude all the other funding bills before the expiration of the next CR. I guess we're hoping that this body is going to have an epiphany that we've got to do the work that we've been trying to do for weeks. The reality is, on December 20th, we will most likely be in the same exact situation as we were this week - and having the exact same conversations. It&#8217;s apparent to the people of America, and everyone in this chamber that this is a flawed and failed process, and we need to fix it. What more evidence do we need for showing that the budget and appropriations process is broken beyond repair than the lack of ability to pass full and stable appropriations?  The American people deserve better than this. The inability of Congress to pass 12 appropriations bills is not only disappointing - it&#8217;s irresponsible. It prevents agencies from starting or resuming projects that were planned and damages our military. CR impacts include major program delays and billions of dollars in wasteful spending - both of which hinder our military readiness to meet today&#8217;s challenges and the ability to develop new capabilities to meet tomorrow&#8217;s emerging threats. We should be completing our work, not continually jumping from one CR deadline to another. Watch my floor speech on this issue . &nbsp;  MEETINGS  In between legislative business, I had productive meetings with Arkansans and other organizations throughout the week. As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas&nbsp;Army&nbsp;National Guard, Chairman of the West Point Board of Visitors, and someone who recognizes the rising threats across the globe - a strong military and national defense is something that is vital to the strength and security of the United States. I had the opportunity to sit down with Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, and the Adjunct General of Arkansas, Major General Kendall Penn, to discuss Army readiness, modernization, and combat training. We also discussed the negative impacts CR&#8217;s have on the Army and its operations. Here's what he said: \"Eventually, the government will provide stable funding to our men and women in uniform, but the problem is that the military can&#8217;t get time back.\" Each day without stable, long-term funding allocated is a day where the military can&#8217;t work on projects, plan ahead, invest in equipment, and properly support our warfighters. The Army must be ready now, and in the future, to confront the challenges and security threats we face. Congress must ensure that they have the resources to do just that, and it&#8217;s unacceptable that we have yet to pass full appropriations. I then met with CBO Director Phillip Swagel to talk about budget issues and the fiscal challenges of our nation. As Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, I feel strongly that we should work together to confront our growing debt burden and ensure a sustainable rate of government spending. We have a moral obligation to future generations to get our fiscal house in order.  The United States is a global leader, and it&#8217;s vital that we continue to use diplomacy to&nbsp;promote stability and democracy across the globe. It was a pleasure to welcome a member of the Georgian Labour Party to D.C. We talked about the importance of democracy, security, and stability to our nations and the international community. We also discussed Russia's aggressive actions in Eastern Europe and its expansion over Georgia and the Caucasus region. Russia&nbsp;is not our friend and must be held accountable for its hostile actions, especially as they continue to seek to undermine the West&#8217;s democratic institutions by&nbsp;sowing fear, instability, and distrust.  The House Budget Committee also held a  to discuss the current and future economic costs of government debt levels. Our economy is strong, and the forward momentum continues, thanks to the pro-growth policies enacted last Congress and under this Administration. Americans are confident, and rightfully so. We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt.  Simply put, the debt is on a completely unsustainable trajectory. The national debt is $23 trillion, and it is projected to grow to more than $34 trillion within a decade. Soon thereafter, on our current path, the federal debt will reach the highest level in American history as a percentage of the economy. Congress must come together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to reduce the debt, deliver on our Article I duty, and make good on our responsibility to the American people who have to balance their own budgets each month.  The next day, I had the opportunity to listen to fellow Arkansas Congressman Bruce Westerman lead a briefing on forestry and carbon capture. By advancing an all-of-the above&nbsp;energy&nbsp;plan, we can both support productivity,&nbsp;energy, and sustainability for the future. Arkansas is leading on these issues, and it was great to hear more from another representative from the Natural State! The World Trade Center recently released a new report on Arkansas&#8217;s economy, and it highlighted the fact that 32% of our total exports are going to Canada and Mexico. Exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, while Mexico exports totaled $870 million. Trade is vitally important to Arkansas and the farmers, ranchers, businesses, and workers who move our economy. The USMCA will allow for a strong trade framework that will provide greater market access, support job growth, protect U.S. intellectual property, and unleash new sources of opportunity. Canada and Mexico are two of Arkansas&#8217;s top trading partners, and modernizing our trade policies will help foster prosperity for decades to come. The votes to pass this deal in Congress are there - Speaker Pelosi should bring this measure to the floor now! Read the report .  I wrapped up my time in Washington by meeting with Billy Goldston of Bella Vista, who represents the Salute Foundation. The Salute Foundation helps those who have served in uniform. The organization focuses on supporting&nbsp;disadvantaged&nbsp;veterans and their families to improve quality of life,&nbsp;empower those in need, and address homelessness issues. Their work provides amazing support to those who have given so much to this great country. I not only thank Billy for his work in Arkansas, but I am also grateful for his previous military service.  Today, I am also happy to announce that Arkansas received two grants that will support the Natural State. Arkansas will receive increased resources to combat feral hogs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a  investment to fund projects to address this invasive species, which has impacted natural resources, farmers, ranchers, and landowners. Additionally, Drake Field in Fayetteville is the recipient of  in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), which will be used to improve the terminal building. Transportation infrastructure is vital to economic growth and a valuable resource for residents and businesses. This investment in Drake Field will enhance safety and modernize the facility to ensure long-term value. I thank Secretary Chao and the Administration for their continued work to support the Third District.  Wishing Arkansas&#8217;s Third District a great weekend!

I am thankful for the almost 50,000 veterans who call the Tenth District home and for all who have fought to keep our country safe. Last Monday was a beautiful day to honor those who served! Why Are We Wasting Our Time On Partisan Bills This week in the House of Representatives we wasted our time debating a partisan Export-Import Bank reauthorization bill. This is especially frustrating because the House Financial Services Committee had a bipartisan agreement to reauthorize the Bank until bill Democrats walked away from it. Instead, House Democrats passed a this partisan bill that President Trump has already announced he would veto and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said would not pass the Senate. The question we should be asking ourselves is: why weren't we voting on bipartisan Ex-ImpEx-Im reauthorization that helps support American jobs while also combating Chinese aggression? Click here or on the image below for a great recap of last week's debate on this partisan legislation. The Sham Impeachment Hearings This week, Congress held the first two hearings of this sham impeachment process. During these hearings, House Democrats made it clear that they will continue to ignore the facts as long as they are able to achieve their goal of removing President Trump from office. To get an idea of how fiercely partisan this process is, click here to watch a video highlighting how Chairman Adam Schiff has acted leading up to this sham process. What is even more disappointing is that House Democrats are holding these hearings less than a year away from the next election. They don't want to let the American people decide who their president should be. Instead of voting to pass the USMCA or to secure our borderlegislation that would actually help the American peoplethey have wasted the last year playing partisan political games. This needs to end. What I Have Been Reading Belmont veteran remembered for his service to country, family Gaston Gazette Last week, Gaston County lost one of its heroes. Mack Drake lived his life dedicated to defending the United States, to his family, and to his fellow veterans. He began his career at just 16 years old when he enlisted in the Marines to fight in WWII and went on to serve in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and later in the U.S. Air Force. We will never forget his service to our country.

A bipartisan bill I authored to help protect Veterans passed out of the House, my bill to boost tourism passed out of Subcommittee and I introduced another bipartisan measure to improve healthcare outcomes for all Americans. Continue reading for more information about my continued work on your behalf.  Fighting for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  Last week, the House passed my Student Veteran Empowerment Act as part of a larger Veterans' package. My bill ensures Veterans utilizing the GI Bill are protected from unexpected school closures. Specifically, GI Bill entitlement benefits are fully restored to a Veteran if a school closes mid-semester without the ability to transfer credits to another institution. Additionally, it put safeguards in place and establishes oversight measures to help prevent school closures from occurring. This bill is about doing the right thing for our nation&#8217;s heroes. They sacrifice a great deal in order to earn the GI Bill, and I want to ensure that those benefits aren&#8217;t squandered by those seeking to exploit students for financial gain. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in expediting passage of this commonsense legislation. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my remarks on the House Floor about this important bill.  Reducing the number of homeless Veterans in America has been a priority of mine since joining Congress. Last week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a 2% decrease in the number of homeless Veterans throughout the nation between 2018-2019, which reflects an approximate 50% reduction since 2009. Locally, the agency reports that Pasco County saw a 57% reduction between 2018-2019, and Hillsborough County saw a 12.9% reduction during this same period. We are making progress, however, even one homeless Veteran is one too many. I will keep working to eradicate homelessness from within the Veteran community. &nbsp; During last week's VA Committee hearing we discussed the spread of false information on social media specifically targeting the Veteran community. We want to work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that those who prey upon our heroes are stopped and held accountable for their deceitful actions.&nbsp; You can watch my exchange with panelists by clicking&nbsp;here. Additionally, I had the chance to meet with VA Committee Ranking Member Phil Roe and VA Undersecretary of Benefits, Dr. Paul Lawrence. We received an update on implementation of the Forever GI Bill and new Information Technology systems. It is important that we provide oversight to ensure the VA is taking action on these important new requirements of law which are designed to help Veterans.   Promoting Tourism  Last week, while I was reading the paper and enjoying my morning coffee, I was delighted to find an ad urging Congressional leadership to reauthorize Brand USA, the nation&#8217;s first public-private partnership to promote the United States as a premier travel destination. As co-Chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, I am proud to co-lead the bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3851, which reauthorizes this important program. The program is particularly beneficial to the Sunshine State. Tourism is the backbone of Florida&#8217;s economy, generating over 1.4 million jobs and bringing nearly 130 million visitors to our state every year. Brand USA has helped create these jobs, reduced the national debt by $231 million dollars, and costs absolutely nothing to tax payers. It is important that Congress reauthorizes Brand USA, and I will continue to work hard to ensure the passage of this legislation.   Also, the Florida Congressional Delegation met last week to discuss ways that we can work together to boost tourism throughout our great state. I&#8217;m thankful for Visit Florida and others who testified on the importance of bringing visitors from around the globe to our great state.  Additionally, the Tampa International Airport was&nbsp;named the best mid-sized airport in America last week. As someone who travels in and out of the airport most weeks, I know how much TPA deserves this special recognition. Joe Lopano and his team work hard to maintain a customer-centered experience, ensuring continued accessibility while allowing for the expansion necessary to boost tourism and enhance options for travelers. &nbsp; Improving Healthcare  Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, to bolster diagnostic research in medicine and improve patient outcomes. Our bill makes critical investments to advance research and progress in diagnostic quality, safety, and value in health care. In the United States, diagnostic errors result in between 40,000 and 80,000 preventable deaths and cost the health care system more than $100 billion each year. Millions of Americans are negatively impacted by a diagnostic error each year. Patients experience a broad range of complications resulting from these errors. While some patients may only encounter a minor inconvenience, many others experience worsening health conditions and even death. According to a 2015 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime. Our bipartisan legislation seeks to tackle this important issue through targeted research that will yield standards in improving the quality, safety and overall value of diagnostics. It is an important step in improving the quality of healthcare available to Americans.   Creating healthy families starts with ensuring the health and well-being of expectant mothers. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 700 women die each year in the U.S. as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications and this is significantly higher than many other developed countries. The Health Subcommittee began investigating this growing problem several years ago, and last year, the President signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law. This important law improved data collection and reporting regarding maternal mortality. It also developed systems at the local, state, and national levels to better understand the burden of maternal complications.  We built off that essential work by passing two bipartisan bills in last week&#8217;s Health Subcommittee mark-up hearing. The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act, authorizes grants to identify, develop, and disseminate maternal health quality best practices, supports training for health professionals, and authorizes grants for operating innovative evidence-based programs that deliver integrated services to pregnant and postpartum women. The Helping MOMS Act enhances coverage for pregnant and postpartum women in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs by giving states the option of covering pregnant and postpartum women for a year instead of 60 days, which is the current timeframe. These bipartisan bills demonstrate our commitment to continue addressing maternal mortality and improving the health outcomes in expectant or new mothers across the country.   Protecting Human Rights  So a short Greek and tall Turk meet at the U.S. Capitol...That might be the opening of a cross-cultural joke, but the actions of Turkey's President Erdogan are NO joke. Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter shared with me the unprecedented harassment he has suffered at the hands of Erdogan's bullying simply for pointing out human rights violations perpetrated by the Turkish regime. Like Kanter, I called for President Trump to cancel last week's meeting with the Turkish leader. A NATO ally that continues to militarily occupy an EU nation, harasses and jails journalists, denies religious freedom to the Holy See of over 300 million Orthodox Christians, violates the Exclusive Economic Zone of a sovereign nation, provocatively infringes on the air space of another, and systematically tries to annihilate the Kurds, does not deserve the ear of the leader of the free world. Though feet apart in height, Enes Kanter and I see eye to eye. I will ensure his voice is not silenced as he speaks truth to power. #shortgreek #EnesKanter  Meeting with Constituents  I appreciated the opportunity to meet with members of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, including Commissioner Jack Mariano and School Board Member Cynthia Armstrong, during their visit to D.C. last week. I enjoyed talking with them about the issues impacting local businesses and their legislative priorities.  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received an email from an elderly constituent in Dade City who was frustrated that his trash hadn&#8217;t been picked up in weeks. While this certainly isn&#8217;t a federal issue, my team tries to help whenever possible. My staff contacted the appropriate local officials, and within two hours, the constituent&#8217;s trash had been removed and his account credited for a month worth of service. He called my office very grateful for such prompt assistance.  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. While we can&#8217;t promise a positive outcome on every case, we do constantly look for ways to help constituents with the problems they are facing. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  It was a great morning for my team to visit the Friday morning market in Dunedin, located in John R. Lawrence Pioneer Park at the intersection of Douglas and Main Streets. I was pleased to find out the market supports locally-based food vendors and small businesses.   My team had the pleasure of participating in the grand opening of the Bayonet Point Wound Care Center. I am confident many patients will get great care at this new facility. Welcome to the neighborhood!   My team enjoyed participating in the North Tampa Bay Chamber's ribbon cutting for Parks Ford. It is great to see Central Pasco County continuing to grow.   My team had the pleasure of facilitating a meeting between Hillsborough and Pinellas county sheriff offices last week. The discussion centered around the possible expansion of a program to bring more mental healthcare professionals to the Pinellas County Jail. It&#8217;s my commitment to help curb recidivism in correctional facilities through a combination of increased access to mental health and the utilization of innovative approaches to help offenders become productive citizens.   My team was honored to help celebrate the 100th birthday of one of my constituents, Cosimo A. DePietto. Captain DePietto served in World War II. Thank you for your service and a very Happy Birthday, sir!   Additionally, at last week&#8217;s Council of Organizations meeting in Dunedin, my team was glad to hear an update from Sheriff Bob Gualtieri on the work he and his team are doing to keep our community safe. We really are fortunate to have so many outstanding first responders who protect and serve the citizens of Tampa Bay each and every day.     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update.

The impeachment inquiry produced important new information as well, and the House voted to formally begin impeachment proceedings. Impeachment  As you know, in September news broke that a whistle-blower had alleged that the President used a high-profile meeting and U.S. military aid as leverage to pressure the government of Ukraine to undertake several investigations related to U.S. domestic politics. On September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House would begin an impeachment inquiry into those allegations. &nbsp;In October, three House committees began taking closed-door depositions from witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. Transcripts of many of those depositions have since been made public. Click here for the transcripts. On October 31, I voted with a majority of Members of the House to approve H.Res. 660,&nbsp;a resolution formally authorizing an impeachment inquiry, on a vote of 232 to 196. Click here for a fact sheet outlining the impeachment inquiry process going forward. &nbsp;It&#8217;s my opinion that a President pressuring a foreign government to influence our elections for personal political gain would constitute an abuse of power justifying impeachment and removal from office. It could constitute a national security threat as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe American elections should be decided by Americans &#150; and that no one is above the law. I also swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.&nbsp;Given that the allegations in this case appear to be credible, I voted in favor of the resolution.&nbsp; Public hearings have now begun and I encourage you to follow them closely.&nbsp; These hearings will provide an excellent opportunity for all Americans to better understand the facts in this case.  &nbsp;Lowering Prescription Drug Prices  Many Americans say they have difficulty affording their prescription medicines, including half of all people in fair to poor health. Nearly a third of all adults reported not taking their medicines as prescribed at some point in the past year because they couldn&#8217;t afford to. Maybe that shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. A study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that Americans pay more than twice as much in the retail market, per person, as people living in the OECD countries &#150; and that &#8220;U.S. spending was higher than spending in any of the other 30 industrialized nations examined.&#8221;  I believe Americans ought to be paying less for their prescription drugs &#150; especially since we contribute through our taxes to the medical research that makes new breakthrough drugs possible &#150; and that American shouldn&#8217;t have to pay more for their medicines than what the drug companies charge people in other countries for the same drugs.&nbsp;  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been working with other House Democrats on legislation to lower prescription drug prices:&nbsp;H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.&nbsp;H.R. 3 would:   Give Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies for lower drug prices; Make those lower drug prices available to Americans&nbsp;with private insurance, not just Medicare beneficiaries; Prohibit drug companies from charging Americans more than 120 percent of what they charge other countries for the same drugs; Create a new, $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare Part D enrollees; Use some of the government savings from negotiating lower drug prices for more research to find new breakthrough treatments and cures; and Use the remainder of the savings to expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental benefits.&nbsp;  The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office&nbsp;estimated that drug negotiations alone from this legislation would save taxpayers $345 billion in&nbsp;Medicare Part D Spending over 2023-2029, while the Office of the Actuary&nbsp;concluded that drug negotiations and Medicare inflation rebates from H.R. 3 would save households $158 billion and private businesses $46 billion from 2020-2029.&nbsp; &nbsp;The House is expected to vote on H.R. 3 soon. &nbsp;Protecting Our Elections  &nbsp;Finally, I joined other House Democrats in voting to approve legislation to protect our elections from foreign attacks. The House approved H.R. 4617, the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for A Lasting Democracy Act (SHIELD Act) on a vote of 227 to 181.&nbsp;  The SHIELD Act would:   Create a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign governments and their agents; Help prevent foreign interference in future elections by improving transparency of online political advertisements; Close loopholes that allow foreign nationals and foreign governments to spend money in U.S. elections; Restrict exchange of campaign information between candidates and foreign governments and their agents; and Prohibit misleading practices about voting dates and procedures; and Establish strong penalties for voter intimidation.  I believe that we must ensure that American elections are decided by Americans &#150; and that we have no time to waste to safeguard our democracy from the attacks that we know are coming in 2020. And I&#8217;m not alone:   The Mueller report concluded, &#8220;The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.&#8221; and FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress that &#8220;The Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere in our elections.&#8221;&nbsp;  I hope and pray that the Senate and President will approve the SHIELD Act or similar legislation to ensure the integrity of our electoral process and protect the future of our democracy. It continues to be an honor and a pleasure to serve you.

This week's episode covers the&nbsp;rising costs of healthcare &#150; which became more expensive thanks to Obamacare. Premiums are up. Copays are up. Deductibles are WAY up. Now, the Socialist Democrats are proposing Medicare-for-All, which would ruin the Medicare system and throw 150 MILLION people off the private insurance they like. The solution to the crisis of healthcare costs is not more government participation, it&#8217;s less. That&#8217;s why Senator Scott is working on common sense solutions to provide quality healthcare at a price American families can afford.&nbsp;See more in the video below or HERE.    Senator Rick Scott also cosponsored the&nbsp;SFC Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019&nbsp;to make sure our men and women in uniform are taken care of every step of the way. See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.              Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Committee Passage of Legislation to Protect Florida&#8217;s Environment  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation advanced two of Senator Rick Scott and Marco Rubio&#8217;s bills to protect Florida&#8217;s environment. The Committee voted to pass the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act to expand research and understanding of blue-green algae and red tide, and the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act of 2019&nbsp;to reauthorize and modernize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 to help restore and protect our nation&#8217;s coral reef ecosystems.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;People from across the world come to Florida because of the state&#8217;s natural beauty. During my eight years as Governor, Florida&#8217;s annual investments to preserve the environment increased by $1 billion. I&#8217;m proud to join Senator Rubio and my colleagues on the Committee to pass the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act and the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act to build on our efforts to protect and preserve Florida&#8217;s environment for generations to come.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Statement Ahead of President Erdogan&#8217;s Visit to White House  In advance of Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s visit to the White House, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;President Trump should implement aggressive sanctions against Turkey for purchasing the S-400 missile system from Russia.&nbsp;Existing law under CAATSA requires the President to enforce sanctions, and today I&#8217;m urging the President to do this immediately unless Erdogan changes course. If he doesn&#8217;t, Congress should consider immediate action.&nbsp;We should also re-evaluate Turkey&#8217;s membership in NATO, a treaty organization created to act as a bulwark against Russian aggression. If Turkey continues to cozy up to Moscow, there is no reason they should enjoy the protections of the NATO alliance. I introduced a resolution in July that lays out these goals. I urge my colleagues to join me and present a united front.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Decision to Invest Retirement Savings in Communist China Threatens National Security  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) decided to shift billions of dollars from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement fund to an index fund that includes Chinese companies. Senator Scott is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan, bicameral Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, which would prevent the FRTIB from steering federal retirement savings to Communist China. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in the FRTIB for ignoring requests from Congress to reverse this decision. Choosing to invest in Communist China threatens our national security and jeopardizes the retirement savings of hardworking Americans. There is no reason U.S. taxpayer dollars should be used to prop up companies under the control of Communist China, which continues to steal our technology, abuse human rights and build up its military to compete with us. I will continue to work to pass the Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, to protect the American people and prevent the FRTIB from supporting Communist China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.

Although we will never be able to repay the tremendous debt we owe to our veterans, I encourage all of us to use this time to give thanks. I also want to use this newsletter to discuss the legislative progress we have made in the Commonwealth against the opioid epidemic and provide perspective on the impeachment narrative at a time when Democrats want to jump to conclusions.&nbsp; &nbsp; HEALING COMMUNITIES STUDY LAUNCH &nbsp;        On October 7, I had the chance to join various national leaders to celebrate the launch of the UK HEALing Communities study on opioid deaths (photo by Mark Cornelison).    &nbsp;  My office is happy to have played a role in the University of Kentucky receiving $87 million in grant funding as part of the HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-term) Communities Study. The funding was announced in April, but officially launched this month. I had the honor of speaking&nbsp;alongside my colleagues&nbsp;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to commemorate the launch of the program. Our Commonwealth is among the states hit the hardest by this epidemic, making this event all the more important. The goal of the HEALing initiative is to reduce opioid deaths by 40 percent throughout Central Kentucky. You can read more about the study and event here.  &nbsp;  PROVIDING HEALTHCARE FOR THOSE IN NEED &nbsp;        Last month, I joined state officials in Mt. Sterling to announce a $500,000 grant for the&nbsp;Post Clinic.&nbsp;    My office was pleased to support a $500,000 grant that was awarded to the Post Clinic in Mt. Sterling last month. This grant will help ensure vital healthcare services continue to be provided for those in need. The Post Clinic provides free, essential services to those in Montgomery and surrounding counties who are without insurance, underinsured, or on Medicare or Medicaid, ranging from primary care to dental care. You can read more about the Post Clinic, its services and eligibility requirements here.  COMMUNITIES WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGHT OPIOIDS &nbsp;        Last month, I had the pleasure of meeting with Wolfe Countians Against Drugs to learn more about their mission to create drug-free communities.    &nbsp;  One of the greatest assets we have during this epidemic is our own community coming together to help those affected. I had the chance to get a firsthand look at this when I met with Wolfe Countians Against Drugs to discuss legislative progress made on the opioid crisis. I am proud to see our local communities coming together to support those in need; this sense of caring for our neighbors is what makes our District and our Commonwealth so unique. We have made tremendous progress on the legislative front and I will continue to fight in Washington to ensure this progress is not lost. You can read more about Wolfe Countians Against Drugs here.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;AMERICANS DESERVE TRANSPARENCY ON IMPEACHMENT   Last month, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats voted on the House floor to deprive any resemblance of due process when it comes to impeachment. This resolution advanced the secretive, hyper-partisan effort from Democrats to impeach the President on yet another baseless theory. I voted against this resolution that attempts to undo the vote of the American people in the 2016 election. You can read my full statement on the resolution here. I also discussed the impeachment inquiry with Leland Conway on WLAP radio in Lexington.&nbsp;You can listen to the entire interview&nbsp;here. &nbsp;  &nbsp; MOBILE OFFICE HOURS To better serve the people of central and eastern Kentucky, my staff conducts regular traveling office hours in every county of the Sixth Congressional District.

Because of their immense sacrifices, we enjoy liberty and freedom. As a Member of Congress, I strive every day to honor their commitment to the United States by ensuring the health and well-being of the more than 25,000 veterans in our Congressional District and the more than 19 million veterans across our country.  I&#8217;m proud to have voted for the 24 bipartisan bills the House passed this year to strengthen care for our veterans. It&#8217;s our collective responsibility to ensure that every American who wears a uniform to defend our country will have the services, opportunities, and care they&#8217;ve earned. Our legislation addresses the full spectrum of the needs of veterans: veteran suicide prevention; military to civilian transition assistance; resources to end veteran homelessness; increasing VA accessibility; and improved health care for veterans. I&#8217;m also very proud to have helped launch the Women Veterans Task Force to ensure that the more than 2 million women veterans have the access to health care, benefits, and resources they&#8217;ve earned.  This year, I&#8217;m especially proud to have made strides to secure housing for veterans and their families. I cosponsored and passed the Homeless Veterans Families Act, legislation to increase funding to help homeless veterans with children have a safe place to live, and I was thrilled to dedicate the opening of the second Fisher House at the Palo Alto VA. The Fisher House program is a unique private-public partnership that supports America's military by providing \"homes away from home\" built on the grounds of major military and VA medical centers. I&#8217;ve fought for funding for a second Fisher House for over a decade, and I&#8217;m pleased the families of veterans are now benefiting from the new house that provides lodging for an additional 20 families of veterans and military at no cost, allowing them to be close to their loved ones as they receive treatment at the Palo Alto VA. The Fisher Houses are beautiful in every way and are a comfort to our veterans&#8217; families during incredibly stressful periods. Service members and their families will save more than $3.387 million a year because of the Palo Alto VA Fisher Houses.   We owe so much to our service members and veterans, and I hope you&#8217;ll take a moment today to bow your head and quietly give thanks to our great patriots for their service and love of country.

Thank you for all you do to make our country&#8217;s freedoms and opportunities possible. We must honor the immeasurable debt we owe to past and present military members for their dedicated service by ensuring there are tools and support available to navigate civilian life. &nbsp;  Earlier this year I announced my VA Readiness Initiative, a comprehensive package of legislative items to ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is always ready to deliver excellent care to veterans. This initiative includes measures to expand access to services, encourage innovation for veteran healthcare solutions, increase accountability at the VA, and empower transitioning service members as they pursue civilian careers.  Happy Veterans Day weekend, may God continue to bless you and the United States of America.  Fighting for Colorado Military Funding For the second time in two months, partisan politics has prevented the U.S. Senate from moving forward on vital funding for the U.S. military. The Centennial State&#8217;s six military bases and critical military commands such as the newly formed U.S. Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base rely on this funding, and face an uncertain future because of Washington gridlock. Altogether, the Senate defense appropriations bill contains roughly $344 million to support military priorities important to Colorado.  Read my latest op-ed in the Colorado Springs Gazette, calling on all of my Senate colleagues to come to the table and provide the vital military resources that impact our national security and the lives of Colorado military families. Colorado&#8217;s service members exemplify the best of our nation, and they deserve better from Washington.  Akron Med Evac Tour &amp; Roundtable   &nbsp;  The staff at Med Evac in Akron work around the clock to help Coloradans in need and save lives during emergencies. Thank you to the pilots, medics, and everyone involved for a great tour and discussion about the services they provide to Colorado residents and how I can support their efforts at the federal level. Thatcher and Caitlyn were really impressed! New U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett  &nbsp; It was an honor to attend the swearing-in ceremony for the 25th Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, Barbara Barrett, in Colorado Springs. We were lucky to be joined by members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed group of African-American World War II military pilots. I&#8217;m grateful for their remarkable service to our nation.  Secretary Barrett&#8217;s new position is incredibly important to Colorado&#8217;s military installations and the future of U.S. Space Command in Colorado. With her strong background in aviation and government service, I have great confidence in her ability to serve as the new head of the U.S. Air Force and I wish her and her family well. Encouraging Investments in Every Corner of Colorado  Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) and I introduced bipartisan legislation to reform the approval process for charitable investments, so organizations can more easily invest in community improvement and job creation. Private charities are more than willing to invest in and grow the economy, but are too often deterred by government bureaucracy. The Philanthropic Facilitation Act (PFA) benefits rural economies in particular by cutting red tape and removing barriers between philanthropists and small businesses, ultimately leading to more job creation. This legislation is a common-sense solution that gets government out of the way and encourages more investments across Colorado where it is needed most. Fighting the Rise of Meth in Colorado  Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner&#8217;s remarks.  &nbsp; I successfully included a bipartisan amendment to increase funding for an anti-meth program in the domestic spending appropriations package passed by the Senate. In between 2011 and 2018, Colorado has experienced a nearly 40 percent increase in admissions for meth addiction. We have to provide new tools and resources to deal with the dangers caused by methamphetamines in our communities. My amendment increases funding for the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program to help state law enforcement agencies fight the rise of meth. Pushing for Full LWCF Funding Senator Michael Bennet and I introduced a bipartisan amendment to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the crown jewel of conservation programs for Colorado. This conservation program comes at no cost to the taxpayer, but has only been funded to its maximum authorization level twice in its history. We were successful in permanently reauthorizing the LWCF earlier this year, and the next step is to make funding automatic. Colorado&#8217;s beautiful public lands rely on this critical conservation program, and it&#8217;s time for Congress to fully and permanently fund it.&nbsp; The Ski Area Fee Retention Act Moves Forward  Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner&#8217;s remarks.  &nbsp; My bipartisan Ski Area Fee Retention Act gained traction with a recent hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I was fortunate to introduce Brendan McGuire, Vice President of Public Affiars at Vail Resorts Management Company, as he testified that this bill would give ski areas in Colorado an important tool to invest in development projects. The Ski Area Fee Retention Act would help local ski areas keep more of the fees they produce, which will lead to increased local investments and improvements. I&#8217;ll continue working to see this important legislation for Colorado ski areas signed into law. Colorado Priorities Pass the Senate I&#8217;m proud to have secured funding for a number of Colorado priorities in the domestic spending package passed by the U.S. Senate. This appropriations bill is important for rural Colorado, with full funding of the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program and an increase of funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) that will help ensure our beautiful public lands are preserved for future generations to enjoy. Click here to learn more about the Colorado priorities funded in the appropriations package, including a sizable increase for scientific research and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.  Maintaining a Critical Relationship with South Korea   &nbsp;  I was honored to be the first Member of Congress to meet with Lee Soo-hyuck, in his new capacity as the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States. The United States-Republic of Korea alliance is critical to U.S. economic and national security interests, and it is a lynchpin of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Our countries have worked together to promote international peace, security, economic prosperity, human rights, and the rule of law. The friendship between our two countries remains ironclad, and we will work together to make it even stronger. Tracking Chinese Intimidation of American Businesses Recently we&#8217;ve seen American companies censor themselves to avoid Chinese retaliation, which sends a chilling ripple effect across our country and further empowers the Chinese Communist Party. The first step to solving any problem is knowing its full extent, which is why Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and I introduced bipartisan legislation to create a U.S. government taskforce to monitor instances of China intimidating U.S. companies that exercise free speech.  TAIPEI Act Passes Senate Unanimously The U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, which Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) and I authored. This bipartisan legislation is intended to strengthen Taiwan&#8217;s standing around the world and comes in response to increased Chinese pressure and bullying tactics intended to restrict Taiwan&#8217;s international space and global diplomatic recognition. The United States should use every tool to support Taiwan&#8217;s standing on the international stage, and I applaud the Senate for sending a strong message to nations that there will be consequences for supporting Chinese actions that undermine Taiwan.

Click here! &nbsp; &nbsp;                                            Dear Cormack,&nbsp;Following a busy week meeting with folks across eastern Connecticut, here to provide you with some updates on my work as we head into Veterans Day Weekend:&nbsp;   An Important Update for our Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans  As&nbsp;we head in to this&nbsp;Veterans&nbsp;Day weekend, I&#8217;m looking forward to honoring all of our veterans at events across eastern Connecticut. Eastern Connecticut is home to so many of our nation&#8217;s veterans and active-duty service members, and it&#8217;s an honor to represent them in Congress. Today, ahead of Veterans Day, I announced the creation of a new resource page on my website to provide Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans and their families with important information on how to apply for new resources being made available to Blue Water vets through the VA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new resources are being made available following Congress&#8217;s passage and the signing-into-law of the&nbsp;Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act&nbsp;(H.R. 299), a bill that I&#8217;ve fought for years to get across the finish line. The new law will take effect on January 1, and my resource page will help provide veterans and their families with more information on the bill, and on how to file or re-file a claim with the VA so that they can receive the benefits they deserve.&nbsp; The debt we owe to&nbsp;our Blue Water Navy veterans&nbsp;for their service, and for the subsequent obstruction to their care, can never be repaid. However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act will soon be the law of the land, and it will help ensure that we do right by them moving forward.&nbsp;I encourage all Blue Water veterans, their families, and anyone else interested in taking advantage of these powerful new benefits to visit the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act resource page on my website, and to contact a Veterans Caseworker in my office so that we can make sure folks have the information they need to get the care they deserve.&nbsp;        Click here to visit my Blue Water Resource Page     Last Green Valley 25th&nbsp;Birthday&nbsp; &nbsp;Last week, it as great to join friends, community members, local leaders, and the staff of Last Green Valley (LGV) at Allen Hill Farm in Brooklyn to celebrate 25 outstanding years of the LGV. There was no better way to celebrate LGV&#8217;s big milestone than with a walking tour of the beautiful valley we&#8217;ve all worked so hard to protect, and I&#8217;m grateful to Lois&nbsp;Bruinooge, Executive Director of LGV, and her team for inviting us all out to commemorate the occasion. Following last week&#8217;s announcement of over half a million dollars in federal funding for our region&#8217;s state parks and wildlife conservation areas &#150; which included $94,250 to expand the Quinebaug River Wildlife Management Area within the Last Green Valley &#150; there was plenty to celebrate. Click here to learn more about the recently announced federal grant awards that will help bolster the Last Green Valley, and other state parks and conservation areas in our region.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you to the folks at Last Green Valley and Allen Hill Farm&nbsp;for hosting Saturday&#8217;s great event, and to everyone who joined us.&nbsp;I&#8217;m looking forward to another 25 great years!&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney at Allen Hill Farm last weekend celebrating 25 years of Last Green Valley     New Gap Financing Program for Homeowners with Crumbling Foundations  Last week, I joined Governor Lamont in announcing the launch of the Supplemental Collapsing Foundation Loan Program &#150; a new statewide program for homeowners with crumbling foundations that will allow for folks who have received assistance from the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company (CFSIC) to receive a loan from participating banks in Connecticut to cover other repairs.&nbsp;The new program will help to cover the cost of repairs that CFSIC isn&#8217;t able to cover.&nbsp;For example, if a deck, patio, or plumbing system needed to be destroyed or altered in order to repair a home&#8217;s foundation, CFSIC could help cover the cost of the foundation repair, and this new program could help cover the cost of repairing the deck, patio, plumbing system, etc.&nbsp;Homeowners can repay a loan from this program through the federal property casualty loss deduction &#150;&nbsp;for more&nbsp;information,&nbsp;visit&nbsp;my resource page&nbsp;online.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m working to find resources to&nbsp;respond to the crumbling foundations crisis at the local, state, and federal levels,&nbsp;and the new supplemental loan program is an important piece of the puzzle. However, one&nbsp;persisting gap in addressing the problem&nbsp;at every level&nbsp;has been a lack of reliable standards for evaluating what quantity of pyrrhotite must be present in concrete in order to pose a danger to a foundation&#8217;s structural integrity. The University of Connecticut and others have efforts underway to explore this missing element, but it&#8217;s clear that more research is needed to help affected homeowners and communities.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the House passed a spending package for FY2020 that included my amendment to provide NIST &#150; the leading federal expert in cement and concrete standards &#150; with $4 million to conduct research on the crumbling foundations crisis, to develop a standard testing method for at-risk homes and other structures for the presence of pyrrhotite, and to create a risk-rating scale so that homeowners, small businesses, and local governments have a better understanding of what quantity of pyrrhotite poses a danger to their foundation&#8217;s structural integrity. The Senate&#8217;s spending bill included $1.5 million for NIST to conduct this research, and now &#150; as the House and Senate are preparing to conference a final spending package &#150; we&#8217;re pushing for the research to be funded at the full $4 million agreed to here in the House.&nbsp;&nbsp;        Click here to read the full letter to the House appropriators      Community Discussion on the Lower Prescription Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp; On Wednesday, I hosted a panel discussion and community conversation at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Groton Senior Center to address the skyrocketing cost of prescription medication, and to highlight the work being done in Congress to give Americans a better deal on prescription drugs&nbsp;through bills like&nbsp;the Lower&nbsp;Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3).&nbsp; I&nbsp;was joined by an impressive&nbsp;group of regional healthcare experts to discuss how&nbsp;out-of-control&nbsp;drug prices&nbsp;are&nbsp;impacting&nbsp;people and families&nbsp;of all ages and from&nbsp;all&nbsp;from all walks of life, and to talk about&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;ways in which H.R. 3 would&nbsp;give Americans a better deal on prescription medication.&nbsp;The Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;would change the law by finally allowing for Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for fairer, lower drug prices&nbsp;-- the kind of prices they offer to other countries, but not to us. It would&nbsp;also&nbsp;charge drug manufacturers for a rebate if they increase the price of their drugs faster than inflation; it would create a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries; and&nbsp;it&nbsp;would reinvest savings into research at the National Institutes of Health, and into improving Medicare.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lower Drug Costs Now Act has a chance to be the most significant legislation on health care that the 116th Congress will accomplish. Prescription drug prices are out of control, and I&#8217;m proud that the House majority has made this issue one of our top priorities this year. In just the past few weeks, H.R. 3 was introduced, hearings were held, and my committee moved to approve the bill so that it can come before the full House of Representatives for a final vote. I&#8217;m grateful to Nora Duncan, Laura Hoch, and Judy Stein for joining me in Groton to talk more about the importance of passing this bill, and I&#8217;m looking forward to pressing ahead so that we can get H.R. 3 across the finish line once and for all.&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney speaking at Groton Senior Center this week on the Lower Drug Costs Now Act     Touring the Newly Upgraded New England Central Rail&nbsp; On Thursday morning, I was joined by officials from Genesee&nbsp;&amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W) and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) to tour the final upgrades of the New England Central Rail (NECR).&nbsp;These recently completed upgrades are an impressive sight, and&nbsp;they&#8217;ll provide firms and small businesses throughout our region with a real opportunity for economic success and growth.&nbsp; Over the past decade,&nbsp;our&nbsp;region has come together to secure federal funding&nbsp;to&nbsp;make much-needed upgrades to the NECR &#150; a rail line that&#8217;s about 100 years old, that until now hasn&#8217;t been able to move at high speeds or to tolerate heavier weights.&nbsp;In September 2014, my office helped secure an $8.3 million federal grant through the U.S. Department of Transportation to upgrade the NECR, which was the&nbsp;culmination of an effort that started five years earlier in 2009.&nbsp;In her article on the new upgrades and what they mean for our region&#8217;s economy, The Day&#8217;s Julia Bergman noted that the&nbsp;$8.3 million&nbsp;federal&nbsp;grant&nbsp;made up about 66% of the total project, while G&amp;W covered the remainder.  The completed project is a&nbsp;great achievement, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;means&nbsp;great things for our region. These upgrades will improve our freight rail service, will help&nbsp;relieve congested highways by&nbsp;getting&nbsp;big trucks off the road&nbsp;and&nbsp;placing more of that cargo onto rail lines, and will open up new&nbsp;economic&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;and frontiers&nbsp;for the many firms and small businesses here in eastern Connecticut who rely on the NECR to do business. We took a ride up the new rail line&nbsp;on Thursday, and it&#8217;s now smooth as silk &#150; no joints, no delays, no &#8216;clackety-clack&#8217; &#150; just a smooth ride. The new and improved NECR will make a big difference for the economy of our region, and I was proud to help secure the federal TIGER grant that made it happen&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney touring the final upgrades of the New England Center Rail     Thank you, as always, for taking the time to read this update. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance. Wishing everyone a happy, safe, and meaningful Veterans Day Weekend,  Have a great weekend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;Joe CourtneyMember of Congress     &nbsp;&nbsp;            OFFICE LOCATIONS        Washington, DC Office 2332 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-2076Fax: (202) 225-4977 Norwich Office 55 Main Street, Suite 250Norwich, CT 06360Phone: (860) 886-0139Fax: (860) 886-2974 Enfield Office 77 Hazard Ave, Unit JEnfield, CT 06082Phone: (860) 741-6011Fax: (860) 741-6036           |            p { margin-bottom:1em; } /***** SMARTPHONE STYLING RULES *****/ @media only screen and (max-width: 497px) { body, td, div, span, p {font-size:40px !important;} a { text-decoration:none; } *[class*=\"container\"] { width:100% !important; table-layout:auto !important;} *[class*=\"footer\"] td { font-size: 12px !important;} *[class*=\"mobileimg\"] { width: 300px !important;} *[class*=\"mobile-hidden\"] { display:none !important; } *[class*=\"mobileshare\"] img { width: 288 !important; height: 50 !important;} }  ","district":"2","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"CT","party":"Democrat","score":2.809383},{"name":"Congresswoman Katherine Clark","address":"MA05KCIMA@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-11-06","subject":"Shielding Our Democracy From Foreign Interference","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                                      &nbsp; &nbsp;Contact&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       &nbsp; &nbsp;                 &nbsp;      Hello Friend, I wanted to update you on recent progress we&#8217;ve made in Congress to protect the integrity of our elections.  \"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.\" In the first paragraph, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report succinctly sums up the stakes of why we must do more to safeguard our democracy from hostile foreign actors. A bipartisan Senate report released a few weeks ago&nbsp;backed up these findings and called on the executive branch to act before it was too late. The extensive interference in the 2016 election is shocking, and it is clear that 2020 will be no different and possibly even worse. Despite warnings from intelligence agencies and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, I believe&nbsp;the administration has not yet taken any concrete steps to shore up our election security.&nbsp;  In fact, during a televised interview in June, the President stated that he&nbsp;may not alert the FBI&nbsp;if offered information on one of his 2020 rivals, and in September, thanks to the courage of a whistleblower, the nation learned about&nbsp;a phone call between the President and the President of Ukraine where the President said, \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\"&nbsp;The call concerned congressionally-mandated security assistance to Ukraine that had been held up for several months. Since then, several&nbsp;witnesses from the State Department have come forward to&nbsp;share their concerns about how American foreign policy is being run.  On October 23, the House passed the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for&nbsp;a Lasting Democracy, or SHIELD, Act. I proudly voted for this bill that would require campaigns to report acts of foreign election interference, close loopholes allowing foreign nationals and governments from spending money to influence U.S. elections, and boost transparency&nbsp;in political advertising.&nbsp;  House Democrats have made election reform a priority since taking the majority. One of the first bills passed by the House this Congress was H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a bill I cosponsored aimed at getting money out of politics, cracking down on the influence of lobbyists and special interests, and expanding voting rights. Additionally, the House passed an appropriations bill earlier including $600 million for states to replace electronic-only voting machines with ones that include paper ballots. The Senate has not yet taken it up.  Are you concerned about foreign interference in the 2020 election?

Hosting Town Halls on the Eastern Shore    Responding to constituents at my Easton Town Hall  I had the opportunity&nbsp;to host three town halls on the Eastern Shore in early October.&nbsp; The first was held at the Greensboro VFC Community Hall in Caroline County, the second at the Talbot County Free Library in Easton, and the third at Stephen Decatur High School in Worcester County.&nbsp; We covered a wide variety of topics including: global warming, the impeachment inquiry, gun control, the Ocean City offshore wind project, the Turkey-Kurdish Conflict in Northern Syria, and more.&nbsp; I look forward to hosting more town halls in the northern part of the district this fall and having you join me on one of our telephone town halls in the future.&nbsp; To get added to the telephone town hall list, please call my DC office.

Honoring one of Maryland's Distinguished Leaders  On October 17th, Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland-07) passed away.&nbsp; While Mr. Cummings and I worked together on issues of importance to Maryland (but agreed less frequently on other issues), he was a respected public servant who had a passion for serving his district and his constituents.&nbsp; His body lay in state at the U.S. Capitol on October 24th.&nbsp; My and Nicole's thoughts and prayers are with his family.  &nbsp;  Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in your letters and Facebook posts.

I&#8217;m thrilled that the Department of Agriculture has chosen Missouri to host the ERS and NIFA. Missouri is once again showing that it is open for business, welcoming these important agencies with a qualified workforce, lower costs of living, and a business climate that allows for families to thrive. I am honored to have been a part of this process and am excited to welcome them to the Heartland. Since August of 2018, I have worked in bipartisan fashion with my Congressional and University colleagues to bring ERS and NIFA closer to stakeholders. Missouri is well suited to provide a direct pipeline of top talent to these two agencies. I&#8217;m incredibly happy that Missourians will contribute to the research produced by ERS and NIFA as it continues to assist some of Missouri&#8217;s most important economic industries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____________ On Wednesday of this week, the House Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 4895, a bill to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This bipartisan legislation modernizes the CFTC, ensures charitable organizations and church retirement plans are treated fairly, and protects customer assets in the event of a commodity broker bankruptcy.    Following the committee markup, the Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research Subcommittee held a hearing to gain insight from producers on the state of organic agriculture.  Throughout the hearing, producers expressed the need for strong regulations that ensure the integrity of the National Organic Program, especially as organic fraud from foreign sources continues to threaten the industry, and the need for reliable labor.  As interest in the organic market continues to expand and all farmers continue to face uncertainty, I enjoyed visiting with these organic farmers about their operations and the growing market for their products.  I look forward to continuing to monitor how provisions in the 2018 Farm Bill seek to address challenges for America&#8217;s farmer and ranchers both short and long term.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____________ This week the House took a vote to try to legitimize Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s impeachment inquiry process. It was another sad step in a demonstration of misplaced priorities by House Leadership Instead of bringing up a vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which would create 176,000 jobs, the Speaker is devoting House time trying to bring up impeachment charges against our President.  The way they are doing this is denies the President the basic due process other presidents have been afforded such as having counsel present, being able to cross-examine witnesses, or have his witnesses subpoenaed.   It continues the unfair proceedings of the past several weeks where Speaker Pelosi and Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, have held closed-door meetings, haven&#8217;t allowed Republicans to call in witnesses, and have prohibited the vast majority of Congressmembers from accessing information collected during these hearings.  We&#8217;ve seen how the Democrats have preferred to build a preemptive narrative against President Trump, tainting the process with selective leaks and controlling who gets to say what and when. It&#8217;s just not right.  This inquiry the House of Representatives voted on last week tries to make up for the sham but falls short allowing the secret hearing to continue and the president to be denied counsel and other rights.  As a Congress, we should be focusing our time addressing the problems faced by Americans; not trying to impeach a president. I will continue to work on behalf of the good people of the 4th Congressional District and fight to ensure Congress prioritizes the people, not politics.  Legislative Update On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4334, the Dignity in Aging Act with my support. As a granddaughter who was close to my grandparents growing up and someone who has worked with senior citizens my entire life, I have a special place in my heart and the utmost respect for those who have led the way in our country for so long.  Many of them have served this nation, sacrificed for future generations, and put their life on the lines for our freedoms. We owe it to them and future seniors to ensure the strength and solvency of those programs they need and rely on for support. This important legislation builds on the Older Americans Act (OAA), increasing seniors&#8217; access to food, transportation, and services they need to live independently, including caregivers and programs to counter social isolation. OAA currently aids 11 million Americans age 60 and over every year. It funds a wide range of popular programs and services that millions of seniors rely upon every day, including Meals on Wheels, transportation services, and part-time job opportunities to support financial security and combat social isolation. For many older individuals, OAA programs are vital to their health, wellbeing, and independence. I was glad to support this vital legislation.  District Update I had the honor of speaking this week to a Women in Agriculture Conference in Columbia. Women play an important role in our state&#8217;s number one industry, and this gathering was designed to provide leadership and hands-on training for women primarily involved in livestock production and to provide ideas for how key decisions are made in farms across Missouri.    I mentioned how I am one of just a handful of working farmers serving in Congress today and how this background in agriculture was such an asset as I worked with my colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee to pass two FARM bills and to work toward creating the right trade policies for those involved in our agriculture industry.  One of those policies is the USMCA, which is awaiting a vote in the U.S. House. This agreement has already been approved by Mexico and is expected to pass in Canada as it will be a good deal for all three countries, adding an estimated $2.2 billion in U.S. agriculture and food exports to Canada and Mexico.&nbsp;    Hopefully, Speaker Pelosi will bring this bill up soon for a vote. America wins when USMCA passes.  Constituent Update While in Columbia, I had the opportunity to meet the new Director of the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans&#8217; Hospital and to visit with the medical team at Truman about PTSD treatment and suicide-prevention among veterans. I was encouraged by our discussion. Patricia Hall is a retired Army colonel who took over the reins of the Truman VA in September. She is already familiar with the VA in Missouri and the needs of veterans here as she previously served as Director of the John J. Pershing VA Medical Center in Poplar Bluff.    She and her team shared all the PTSD treatment options available to our veterans.&nbsp; They are focused on helping veterans get the help they need and are taking proactive steps to partner with groups like Welcome Home in Columbia which provides shelter and services to homeless vets. The Mid-Missouri region is blessed to have such compassionate and competent professionals and volunteers in the area reaching out and helping veterans overcome challenges and live lives of hope and purpose.

Gallagher                                     &nbsp;     Getting our Fiscal House in Order       Friends,  We've known for years that the trust funds supporting our nation&#8217;s most vital programs are on the brink of collapse. Yet rather than try to solve this problem, Congress has kicked the can down the road and avoided the tough debates needed to fix the mess we can all see coming.  This is unacceptable. These trust funds support critical programs like Medicare and Social Security, which people across Northeast Wisconsin depend on. We must find a way to ensure the federal government keeps the promises it has made and preserves these programs for years to come.  That's why this week I introduced the TRUST Act, a plan to help get our  in order. This bill would establish Congressional rescue committees tasked with strengthening each federal trust fund at risk of insolvency, and require Congress to vote on the ideas these committees come up with. It's not a silver bullet solution, but it's an  that will&nbsp;force Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to find a plan we can agree on--something Congress has failed to do on its own.  We don&#8217;t know what answers the rescue committees will come up with, but we do know that without any action, we risk cuts to Social Security and Medicare or massive tax hikes down the road, both of which would be devastating to Northeast Wisconsin.&nbsp;  Problems don't age well, and it's time for Congress to get serious about this problem. Many of these trust funds are projected to become insolvent within the next 13 years. There's no time to waste.&nbsp;  Semper Fi,   &nbsp;  Congressman Mike Gallagher (WI-08) Longworth House Office Building | Washington, DC&nbsp; 20515 (202) 225-5665Click here and sign up for Rep.

As a Member of two of the committees overseeing in the inquiry, I&#8217;m extremely grateful for the courage and dedication demonstrated by these lifetime civil servants who, at unimaginable personal and professional risk, have put the country and our Constitution above their own welfare and have helped the House get to the truth. In one particularly remarkable interview, we heard from Purple Heart recipient Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the first current White House employee to testify and someone who has been the subject of vile slander and baseless attacks by the President and Republicans who know the evidence and testimony are damning. Because they can&#8217;t defend against the facts, they are attacking the individuals providing the evidence and first-hand accounts of the illegal and inappropriate pressure Trump used against Ukraine in order to force &#8220;investigations&#8221; into his political rival.&nbsp;Also this week, the impeachment process entered a new phase with the passage of H.Res. 660, a resolution setting forth the process we will use for bringing the evidence to the American public and the Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment. This process provides protections for the President not seen by his predecessors and will lay out the mountain of evidence that the three committees have unearthed over the last several weeks. There was a great deal of other House business, as you will see below.

Votes and Legislative Highlights Voted for Next Phase of Impeachment Inquiry and Heard More Explosive Testimony about the President&#8217;s Corruption On Thursday, House Democrats proudly passed H.Res. 660, a resolution setting forth the process we will use for bringing the evidence to the American public and the Judiciary Committee for consideration of articles of impeachment. The process outlined in H. Res 660 includes holding open hearings, releasing public transcripts, and transmitting evidence to the Judiciary Committee. This resolution demonstrates that the House remains committed to a fair, lawful, and open process that Americans can trust. While such a resolution is not required for the impeachment to lawfully proceed, we are taking this extraordinary step in the interest of transparency and fairness. The mountain of damning evidence gathered by the three committees can no longer be brushed aside or carelessly denied. It&#8217;s time for the facts and evidence to be put to the American people so that they can decide the matter for themselves.   On Tuesday, I was proud to vote with 404 of my colleagues to pass a historic resolution formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide. This vote, decades in the making, affirms that the Ottoman Empire and its forces engaged in an extermination campaign against Armenians during World War I. It also upholds the long U.S. record of recognizing the genocide, which began with our then-Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and continued with Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Growing up, my Armenian mother often talked about the genocide with fear and anger. As I said in my remarks on the House floor, passing this resolution helps quell some of this fear and anguish and affirms the legacy of those who perished for millions of Armenians worldwide. I am especially proud to have such overwhelming, bipartisan support for this critically important recognition of genocide. Given Turkey&#8217;s ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign in Syria, this vote also served as a warning that these atrocities will not be forgotten and perpetrators will be held to account for their crimes.  House Passes Sanctions on Turkey to Condemn Acts of War in Northern Syria This Tuesday, I joined 354 of my House colleagues in voting to sanction Turkey for its aggression in Northeast Syria. This resolution, which rebuked the President&#8217;s haphazard and irresponsible Syria policy, will signal to Turkey and our allies that the President does not speak for the American people or Congress. The resolution will also give the Administration specific tools needed to encourage Turkey to adhere to the existing ceasefire and deter future aggression, such as the ability to sanction Turkish officials, military leaders, and soldiers. Congress has shown that we will stand with our Kurdish and other Middle Eastern partners and against Turkey&#8217;s incursion. I hope passing this bill will lead the Administration to stop abdicating its responsibilities and start leading in Syria.  Protected Public Lands and Natural Resources On Wednesday, House Democrats moved a series of bills that would protect our beautiful natural spaces from exploitation and destruction. H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act, would ban new uranium mining claims around the Grand Canyon, one of our most remarkable national treasures and home to critical biodiversity and water resources. H.R. 2181, the Chaco Culture Heritage Protection Act, would protect a sacred site for Pueblo nations that houses close to 4,000 historical archaeological sites by prohibiting oil and gas development within a ten-mile radius of the Chaco Canyon National Historic Park. H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act, would address years-long oil and gas disputes within the Thompson Divide Withdrawal and Protection Area by designating nearly 80,000 acres as new recreational land, establishing a voluntary lease relinquishment process, and creating a pilot program to capture and utilize methane emissions.  These bills take an important step toward preserving America&#8217;s incredible natural resources and public lands for future generations and I will continue to work with my Democratic colleagues to ensure greater protections in the face of Republicans&#8217; ongoing attacks on our environment and precious natural resources.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Chaired Roundtable on the Electronic Health Record Implementation at the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs On Wednesday, I co-chaired a Joint Roundtable between the House Armed Services Committee and the House Veterans Affairs Committee addressing the roll-out of a new electronic health care record system. The new system is housed within the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs and comes in response to the previous VA health care systems that have clearly failed our veteran populations. Wednesday&#8217;s roundtable brought together experts from the DoD and VA to discuss the rollout of the new electronic health record system across military bases and VA regions, and how it will provide continuity of care for active-duty servicemembers transitioning to veteran status. This is an important and complex process that will require continued congressional oversight and my colleagues and I are committed to ensuring that this new health care record system addresses numerous problems that have plagued our veterans for far too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;   As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional UXO/Demining Caucus, I spoke at a briefing on Tuesday that included representatives from demining and advocacy groups as well as the U.S. Department of State who discussed efforts to remove thousands of unexploded cluster munitions that remain in Laos from U.S. wars in Southeast Asia. Over 2 million bombs were dropped on Laos during this time, with roughly 30 percent failing to detonate. They remain a terrible danger to human health and development. Over 50,000 Laotians, 40 percent of them children, have been injured or killed by our weapons while they play, farm, or walk to school. Last year, I saw firsthand the impact of these remnants of war on the people of Laos and I was inspired to create the UXO/Demining Caucus. This year, I led my colleagues in keeping funding for UXO removal in Laos in the budget and I co-sponsored H.R. 2097, the Legacies of War Recognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act. As I&#8217;ve said many times, it&#8217;s our responsibility to clean up our mess and to do whatever we can to ease the burden on Laos, the most heavily bombed country worldwide.    Meetings with Jackie Met with Artsakh Foreign Minister On Wednesday, I met with Masis Mayilyan, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Artsakh, which democratically governs lands freed from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s. Meeting in Washington, DC provided an excellent follow up on my visit to Artsakh earlier this month, providing an opportunity for us to discuss Artsakh&#8217;s upcoming elections, its inclusion in the peace process with Azerbaijan, and demining efforts. I look forward to continuing to support Artsakh in the years to come and working together in the pursuit of&nbsp;a peaceful and prosperous future for the region.   On Tuesday, I met with a delegation of constituents and leaders from J Street, a pro-Israel, pro-peace group, in town for the organization&#8217;s annual conference. We discussed the importance of the two-state solution, a diplomacy-first approach with Iran, and values-based foreign policy. J Street has proved an invaluable partner for me and fellow Members of Congress who believe in fighting for a Jewish, democratic Israel.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District Each week, hundreds of my constituents reach out to my San Mateo and Washington, D.C. offices to express their concerns and support for issues and get information about legislation and policies. Every constituent who writes in receives a personal response. Some issues constituents raised this week include:  &#149; 80 constituents shared their support for H.Res 296, a resolution affirming the United States record on the Armenian Genocide. As one of only three Members of Congress of Armenian heritage, I am heartened that this measure was agreed to in the House by a vote of 405-11. By passing this resolution, we have affirmed that we will continue to stand against evil and that history cannot be rewritten.  &#149; 62 constituents expressed their continued concern regarding climate change. President Trump&#8217;s flat denial of climate change science in favor of advancing his personal agenda to bail out polluting industries is a direct threat to the safety and prosperity of the American people.

This is the number one issue people in our district ask me about, and has been my priority since getting to Congress.  Back in June, a Republican member and I introduced a bill called the &#8220;Real-Time Benefits Act.&#8221;&nbsp;It&#8217;s a bipartisan bill, and it will help lower out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.  Well, on Monday night it passed the U.S. House of Representatives with unanimous, bipartisan support. It&#8217;s now on to the Senate.  Here&#8217;s how it works: insurers would be required to upload information on drug prices which doctors would access through their electronic prescribing program. Doctors and Medicare Part D patients could then receive details, right in their doctor&#8217;s office, on the price of a drug based on insurance plan, the price of any cheaper drugs that would fit their needs, and the price difference at each pharmacy. Patients would leave their doctor&#8217;s office knowing the cheapest price for a prescription, and where to get it.&nbsp;  This will not only lower the out-of-pocket costs that seniors, in particular, are paying for drugs, but it will inject much-needed price transparency into our system. Price transparency will help support good old-fashioned competition &#150;&#150; which helps lower costs across the board.     Since I got to Congress, I&#8217;ve been focused on what we can do to follow through on those bipartisan areas of agreement, and come up with practical legislation that can drive costs down. Democrats and Republicans have both said the right things when it comes to lowering prescription drug costs. They have talked the talk. Now it&#8217;s time for the Senate to walk the walk.  I am incredibly proud that our legislation passed, and I&#8217;ll be sure to keep you updated on the next steps.

Others enlist for duty and honor. Many join to be a part of something bigger than oneself. And everyone serves to defend and protect our great country. As Vice President Mike Pence recently told service members stationed abroad, \"You come from the rest of us, but you are the best of us - heroes all.\" While I didn't have the honor to serve in our Armed Forces, many of my family members have and I consider serving as your United States Representative my chance to fight for our active duty service members, veterans and your families in Congress.* I wanted to share a few updates on legislation I've been working on that will go a long way to support veterans.* Right now, my staff and I spend a lot of time cutting through needless bureaucracy and red tape for veterans who need access to their service and medical records - a process that can drag on for months. *Veterans regularly come to my office with stacks and stacks of papers, service records and medical files.* Sometimes it's enough papers and files to fill several boxes because the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) still hasn't transitioned to electronic health records. It's almost 2020 - it's past time for our veterans to have the best technology available when it comes to their care. *I'm proud to tell you the Trump Administration has made fixing this problem a top priority. *Under President Donald Trump's leadership, the VA is working to deliver a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA. This will grant doctors and veterans alike access to the complete picture of a veteran's health information - improving the VA's ability to care for veterans.* This is a massive, 10-year modernization effort and I want to make sure we do it right. I recently introduced the *Department of Veterans Affairs Electronic Health Record Advisory Committee Act* (H.R. 4693), a bipartisan bill to ensure we have transparency and accountability to make this transition as seamless as possible for veterans. *The new electronic health record system is too important to veterans' health care for the VA to get wrong, and my bill will provide strong oversight.* * [image = In this same vein, it's important to ensure professionals who care for our veterans are the very best available.* I was extremely concerned when I found out the VA was hiring some providers with revoked licenses. *That's why I introduced a bill to ensure there are clinical reviews for all care recommended by these providers. If the third-party review finds a practitioner would have recommended a different treatment plan, the veteran will be notified. *This legislation* *is a common-sense step to hold accountable providers* *who had a revoked license and to ensure our veterans received proper treatment and* *care.* As Fort Bragg's Congressman and a voice for veterans across the district, I will continue to do everything in my power to fight for our veterans and ensure you have the best health care out there. *If any veterans in the Eighth District can't get an answer from the VA in a timely fashion or if they feel they have been treated unfairly, please reach out to my Concord office at 704-786-1612, my Fayetteville office at 910-997-2070, or my Pinehurst office at 910-246-5374. * *I am here to serve you and will work hard to help in any way I can.* *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* [image = [link 1] [image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] [image = [link 6] [image = [link 7] [image = [link 8] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":5.274989},{"name":"Congresswoman Yvette Clarke","address":"info@ny09yc.congressnewsletter.net","timestamp":"2019-10-25","subject":"Congresswoman Clarke Honors the Life and Legacy of Chairman Elijah E.

Cummings. As one of seven children born to sharecroppers, it is safe to say that Chairman Cummings embodied the epitome of our ancestors' wildest dreams, as one of the greatest leaders in the United States Congress. Chairman Cummings represented Baltimore, Maryland with pride and dignity, and dedicated his career to ensuring that his beloved community was never left behind. As Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Mr. Cummings used his voice to protect our democracy and Constitution until his last breath and we are forever indebted to his lifelong dedication to public service. He will be remembered as a steadfast advocate of the Congressional Black Caucus who used his voice to elevate our colleagues in leadership positions and to mentor Black staffers. Let us take comfort in knowing that Chairman Cummings' legacy will be forever ingrained in the halls of Congress through the next generation of leaders that his work impacted and inspired. Chairman Cummings completed his mission--he is now dancing with the angels and will go down in American history as a pillar in preserving our democracy and our core American values. Words cannot express the pain that our community feels during this time of sorrow, but we must lift our heads and continue to walk in the light of Chairman Cummings' legacy. We are standing on the shoulders of a giant and we will live out his mission of creating a better America for all. On behalf of the Clarke Family and the Ninth Congressional District of New York, I am lifting Mrs. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, his children, and loved ones in prayer. Thank you for sharing such a beautiful spirit with the American people. May Chairman Elijah E. Cummings Rest in Power.

American elections should be decided by Americans, just as our Founders intended.&nbsp; We urge the Senate to show the patriotic leadership that their counterparts in the House have abandoned, and take up this legislation to defend our elections, national security and democracy.&nbsp; We also urge them to honor their oath by finally taking up H.R. 1, the For The People Act, and the SAFE Act, which strengthen our defenses against foreign assault.&nbsp; We have no time to waste to safeguard our democracy from the attacks that we know are coming. &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Intern for your Congresswoman Do you have an interest in government? Do you want to better understand the legislative process? Do you want to give back to your community?&nbsp; If you answered yes to any of these questions then you might be interested in an internship in either the San Francisco or D.C. office! Congresswoman Pelosi&#8217;s internship program offers college students and recent college graduates a unique opportunity to learn about the functions of the U.S. House of Representatives, as well as the Congresswoman's work as the representative of the City and County of San Francisco (12th Congressional District, California) and her role as the Speaker of the House. Last year, House Democrats took an historic step forward to ensure that our Congressional community reflects the diverse perspectives, voices and experiences of the American people it is our profound honor to serve by creating the House Paid Internship Fund. The Congress and the country are greatly strengthened when opportunities are extended to all, no matter their zip code, socioeconomic status or background, and when our halls are open to young people who embody the beautiful diversity of America. Under the Paid Internship Fund, at least one paid intern slot in the office is reserved for a student that is a Pell Grant recipient, who will be paid at the maximum cap of $1,800 a month, working a 30-hour internship week. In the busy atmosphere of a Congressional office, it is important that interns conduct themselves in a mature, professional manner; are well-organized and able to take initiative, follow instructions, perform well under pressure; and work&nbsp;as an integral&nbsp;part of a team. Skills required include:   Effective and professional phone manner Computer experience Good typing ability Punctuality Attention to detail Ability to follow instructions Ability to complete tasks efficiently and thoroughly  &nbsp;Congresswoman Pelosi supports students requesting credit for their internship through their school or university.&nbsp; The deadlines for our Spring internship applications are November 8th for the D.C. office and November 23rdth for the San Francisco office. &nbsp;Apply today!  &nbsp;      A constituent recently contacted my office because he was denied entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at an international port of entry. As part of the denial, the constituent was banned from entering the United States for ten years. The office contacted CBP with additional information and clarification provided by the constituent.

This brand new library is a beautiful facility with updated features for readers, including expanded collections of books and e-books, a larger children&#8217;s section and dedicated teen area, a 45-seat multi-use program room, and more computers and technology equipment. In addition to touring, I was able to visit with a group of 3rd graders from Joseph Henry Elementary School in the Galway Central School District. I am a proud advocate for increased funding for libraries, and sent a letter to House Appropriators earlier this year to request added funding for the Library Services and Technology Act. Speaking Out with House Republican Leadership About Lack of Transparency    This week, I was proud to stand with members of House Republican leadership and voice my concerns over the conduct of Democrats, and House Intelligence Chair Rep. Adam Schiff, throughout the impeachment process.&nbsp;The impeachment inquiry has been a closed door, unfair and unprecedented process from the beginning.&nbsp; Not only have Republican members on the Intelligence Committee been barred from reading certain documents related to the impeachment inquiry, the vast majority of Members of Congress have had no access at all to any transcripts or depositions. I believe all Members of Congress and the American public should have access to the transcripts. Adam Schiff has turned this very serious matter into a political game and he is unfit to Chair the House Intelligence Committee.&nbsp;Watch my full statement here or above.  Introducing the State Workforce Incentive Act  This week, I introduced the&nbsp;State Workforce Incentive Act along with Congressman Fred Keller (PA-12.) This legislation reforms the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, shifting it to a state-directed program of annual loan repayment benefits for workers in high-need occupations. While too many hardworking Americans carry the burden of student debt, the broken PSLF program has only sown confusion and frustration for borrowers seeking relief. I was recently asked by constituents about how we can fix and modernize this program at my Coffee With Your Congresswoman in Lowville. My legislation levels the playing field for borrowers and targets loan relief to low- and middle-income households. Further, it empowers states to address the workforce and public-service needs in their communities, such as beginning farmers or childcare professionals. It is time for a new approach, and this bill delivers a state-led solution to the $1.5 trillion student debt problem facing our nation. Read more about the legislation here.&nbsp;  Voting to Censure Chairman Schiff  This week, I voted in favor of bringing a resolution to the House Floor to censure Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. As an original cosponsor of the resolution, I was one of the first Members to ask when Chairman Schiff had access to the whistleblower complaint. I was also the first Member to call him out publicly for his 'parody' testimony while millions of Americans tuned in. Adam Schiff is unfit to serve as Chairman of the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee and I voted to bring this Resolution to the House Floor to censure him because of his continued failed leadership and lack of transparency with both Members of the House and the American public. The American people deserve better. Read more here.&nbsp;  Speaking on Ending Discrimination Against Pregnant Women in the Workplace    Discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace is an indefensible practice, and I am glad to see Congress take an active role to ensure they are given robust protection under the law. This week, I spoke in a House Education and Labor Committee hearing about the protections and accommodations necessary for pregnant women in the workplace. I am proud to recently have introduced the Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment Act along with my colleagues to enhance protections for this specific group of women in the workplace, and I will continue to work to ensure their rights are protected.&nbsp;Watch my questioning here or above.&nbsp;  Meeting with the Australian Embassy, Albany Academies' Head of School, and the Fulbright Association       I had a great meeting this week with Australian Ambassador Katrina Cooper and Australian Embassy Congressional Liaisons Elizabeth Willis &amp; Sarah Storey. We spoke about national security and strengthening the U.S. &#151; Australia partnership. I also met with the Albany Academies' Head of School. I proudly attended the Albany Academy for Girls and it was great to talk about the importance of maintaining access to private and public schools in Upstate New York and how to best prepare grade school students for higher education &#150; one of my top priorities in Congress. Additionally, I met with the Fulbright Association, including a constituent who served at Fort Drum, to discuss constituent stories of the impact that the Fulbright Program has at home and abroad.&nbsp;  Remembering Congressman Elijah Cummings  Yesterday, Civil Rights icon Congressman Elijah Cummings lied in state in the U.S. Capitol. He was one of the most deeply respected Members on Capitol Hill, and it was a true honor to serve the American people with him. He will be missed walking the halls of Congress but his legacy will endure. May he rest in peace.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!

Stefanik recognized for leadership, support of independent colleges, universities  North Country Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, was recognized Oct. 17 for her leadership and support of independent colleges and universities.  She was recognized by Barbara K. Mistick, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, with the presentation of a framed replica of her Congressional Independent Colleges Caucus (CICC) Member Spotlight.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;As a proud graduate of an independent college, the CICC caucus allows me to be a leading voice in Congress on the issues impacting independent colleges and universities,&#8221; Stefanik said. &#8220;I continue to see the impact independent colleges make on the lives of students, and in the communities across my district and throughout the nation. A strength of our higher education system is the variety that exists across the sector, in which independent colleges have an important place in providing students with distinct learning opportunities to foster their individual growth and development.&#8221; St. Lawrence University President William L. Fox, Ph.D. credited Rep. Stefanik with recognizing how higher education empowers students.  &#8220;Congresswoman Stefanik understands the transformational power of higher education and has been a leader and strong supporter of issues such as access and affordability that are important to colleges and universities in the North Country,&#8221; Fox said. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _________________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

The desperation of President Trump and House Republicans to distract the public from the damning facts of the impeachment investigation with this juvenile stunt underscores the fact that they have no defense for the President's blatant and illegal solicitation of a foreign government&nbsp;to dig up dirt on his political opponent. It also shows contempt for the institution and those charged with protecting it, including the US Capitol Police. And their claims fly in the face of the fact that Republicans conducted more than 100 private interviews in the Republican-controlled Benghazi investigation. The Benghazi&nbsp;investigation was underway for four months before a public hearing was held. After two and a half years and spending more than $7 million in taxpayer funds they found no evidence of their accusations. In fact, the Republican Majority report on Benghazi stated, &#8220;Interviews are a more efficient and effective means of discovery. Interviews allow witnesses to be questioned in depth by a highly prepared member or staff person.&#8221; I want to assure everyone, including the President and Republicans in Congress, that public hearings on the impeachment inquiry are coming soon and the American public will get the full story. There was also&nbsp;regular House business, including the passage of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act in response to the Russian attack on the 2016 election and future attacks. We also passed the bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act, which requires companies to report who owns them (&#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221;) to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This critical legislation will cast a light on the dark inner workings of shell companies and elaborate corporate structures. And we voted for the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act to extend funding for this critical legislation to close the rape kit backlog from 2019 through 2024. The Act provides grant funding for crime labs to process DNA evidence and is the central program to end the backlog. That&#8217;s not all, as you will see below, and be sure to check out the next edition of Jackie&#8217;s DC Dashboard for further updates.

On Tuesday, we heard explosive testimony from former Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor about the &#8220;irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making with respect to Ukraine&#8221; used by the President for his own political ends while putting the fledgling democracy of Ukraine in peril. On Wednesday, the House Committees heard from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper to gain additional insight into the impact of the withheld military assistance to Ukraine. Rest assured that we will follow the facts, and our constitutional duty to hold the President accountable for abuses of power and dereliction of his own duties to the American people.  Passed the SHIELD Act to Protect the Integrity of U.S. Elections On Wednesday, I voted to pass the bipartisan Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act. This critical legislation responds to the Russian attack on the 2016 election and would shore up our electoral defenses for the impending 2020 onslaught. To ensure that another campaign like Trump&#8217;s 2016 campaign will not collude with foreign nationals or risk becoming a foreign asset, the SHIELD Act creates reporting requirements for contacts with foreign entities and prohibits campaigns from providing sensitive campaign material to covered foreign nationals. The bill also fights foreign interference by closing loopholes that have let foreign nationals run free with online political ads and permitted foreign nationals to use dark money to exert influence on political expenditures by non-profits and other legal entities. The SHIELD Act&#8217;s passage builds on the bold action House Democrats took to close dangerous gaps in our voting security by passing H.R. 1, the For The People Act, and H.R. 2722, the Securing America&#8217;s Federal Elections (SAFE) Act, earlier this year.  Voted to End Shell Company Abuses of Tax, Legal Systems This week, I voted for and the House passed the bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act on a vote of 249-173. By requiring companies to report who owns them (&#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221;) to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), this legislation will cast a light on the dark inner workings of shell companies and elaborate corporate structures, which can easily be abused for nefarious ends.  Through anonymous shell companies, bad actors have gained unimpeded, untraceable access to our financial system, allowing them to engage in money laundering, sanctions violations, tax evasion, and countless other crimes and frauds. That&#8217;s why national security and law enforcement groups support it and the White House has endorsed this crucial House bill. I call on the Senate to quickly pass this much-needed legislation so it can be presented to the President for his signature and become law.  Reauthorized the Debbie Smith Act to Close the Rape Kit Backlog This week, I voted for and the House passed the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act to extend funding for this critical legislation to close the rape kit backlog from 2019 through 2024. Sexual violence is an epidemic in America. One in three women experience sexual violence in their lifetime, one in five women are sexually assaulted on college campuses, and 84 percent of Native women have experienced violence. The landmark Debbie Smith Act provides grant funding for crime labs to process DNA evidence and is the central program to end the backlog, which includes both evidence that arrived at a crime lab that was never tested and evidence that was never sent to a lab in the first place. Ensuring that states have adequate funding to test rape kits will keep our communities safer, hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes, and ensure that survivors get the justice owed to them.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Roundtable on Financial Difficulties of Enlisted Military Life On Wednesday, I chaired a Military Personnel Subcommittee roundtable featuring six military spouses who bravely discussed the challenges they face and the ability of military programs&nbsp;to help them.   Hearing on Armenia&#8217;s Democratic Progress On Tuesday, I participated in a hearing hosted by the U.S. Helsinki Commission on Armenia&#8217;s democratic progress and U.S. policy and shared my impressions from my recent trip to Armenia. Though Armenia&#8217;s government has a limited window in which to enact fundamental reforms to its Constitution while improving the quality of daily life through better delivery of basic services, I came home deeply impressed by the passion and talent of young Armenians working toward a brighter future. The country is in good hands and U.S. aid programs should follow Armenia&#8217;s lead. Tuesday&#8217;s hearing provided a great reminder of the potential and difficulties that can arise with reform. It also offered an opportunity for Congress to hear directly from an Armenian parliamentarian and civil society leaders. As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, I look forward to working with Armenia as we continue to build a strong relationship between our countries for a more secure and prosperous future for both of our countries.  Unveiled the Democratic Women&#8217;s Caucus Policy Agenda for Unleashing the Power of Women and Girls  Our bold vision includes legislation to close the gender wage gap, provide paid family and medical leave, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, repeal the Hyde amendment, protect pregnant workers from discrimination, and extend rights against harassment to all workers. We will be pushing the Committees of jurisdiction to take up our proposals so that all women and girls can thrive, making our communities stronger, safer, and more prosperous.    Meeting with Jackie The San Francisco Health Network and California Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems  At the meeting, we discussed pressing issues facing San Francisco&#8217;s health care network, such as the future of Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments and the homelessness crisis. DSH payments provide critical financial support to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured patients. I am committed to fighting for a health care system that ensures accessible, high quality care for everyone.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District Each week, hundreds of my constituents reach out to my San Mateo and Washington, D.C. offices to express their concerns and support for issues and get information about legislation and policies. Every constituent who writes in receives a personal response. Here are some issues constituents raised this week:   &#149; 33 constituents shared their support for the continued protection of public lands. Our nation is filled with natural beauty. In northern California alone, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, Point Reyes, Muir Woods, Fort Point, Big Sur, and Yosemite have dazzled millions of Americans and foreign tourists with the splendor of nature. We should be investing in conservation projects to ensure these magnificent places will exist for generations to come, not stripping the land of its resources. I will continue to fight for public land ownership and robust conservation funding. &#149; 18 constituents wrote to me to discuss the need for climate smart infrastructure, which refers to infrastructure that is tougher and more resilient to damage caused by extreme weather patterns. I very much support infrastructure that is &#8220;climate smart&#8221; and designed in a way to reduce heat trapping emissions to the maximum extent possible.

I wanted to take a moment to let you know about my recent visit to Silver City earlier this month. I was honored to open the second annual New Mexico Outdoor Economics Conference. It was refreshing to be joined by so many leaders from across our state who are finding ways to grow the outdoor industry. Public lands fuel our thriving outdoor recreation economy in New Mexico and sustain outdoor traditions. Silver City is a shining example of a gateway community that thrives because of its access to the nation's first wilderness area, the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument, the Gila River, and the Continental Divide Trail.

I also enjoyed celebrating the 51st anniversary of the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act at Little Toad Creek Brewery and Distillery with the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance. Wild & Scenic designations have protected portions of Rio Grande up in northern New Mexico, the Rio Chama, the East Fork of the Jemez, and the Pecos. Sections of the Gila and San Francisco watershed deserves similar protections. While I was in Silver City, I sat down with local community stakeholders to discuss legislation Senator Tom Udall and I are beginning to draft to permanently protect sections of the Gila.

I am committed to providing resources and support to local small businesses that are the backbone of our economy and critical to job creation and sustained economic growth. I remain committed to working hard to deliver results for all New Mexico communities. I hope you can stay in touch about issues that are important to you and your family.

With only 21 legislative days left in the calendar year &#151; and issues like prescription drug prices, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, surprise medical bills, border security, and so many others left to resolve &#151; &nbsp;their contempt for President Trump has fueled a closed-door, behind the scenes, hyper-partisan \"impeachment inquiry\" where Congress and the American people are kept in the dark. Congressional Democrats need to bring their impeachment process out of the shadows and get back to the business of the American people. &nbsp;&nbsp; In the interest of securing our elections, the Democrats brought a bill &#151; the SHIELD Act&nbsp;&#151; to the floor yesterday that would federalize our elections by substantially restricting free speech through government overreach all while failing to actually secure our elections. In its place, we offered a Republican alternative that actually targets foreign actors to prevent meddling in our elections, and modernizes our existing laws for the 21st Century. Unfortunately, our amendment was defeated as the Democrats continued advancing their socialist agenda. Keep reading to learn about what we've been doing in the Ways and Means Committee.   Speaker Pelosi's Fewer Cures for Patients Act Last week, the Ways &amp; Means Committee held a hearing on H.R. 3, the Democrat&#8217;s drug pricing bill. This bill would tie the prices paid by consumers in America to an international index of countries with much different healthcare systems. The resulting government price setting would result in fewer resources for investment in research and development of cures and life-saving drugs for patients in need. Scientists researching how to cure new diseases, manufacturing jobs, and other critical areas of drug development and product delivery would all be detrimentally impacted. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has reported that 8-15 new drugs would not come to the market over the next 10 years if H.R. 3 were implemented. A more appropriate title for Speaker Pelosi's bill would be the Fewer Cures for Patients Act. Unfortunately, by advancing this disastrous bill, House Democrats are working towards fewer cures instead of fighting for life-saving treatments for patients.  Click below to watch my remarks during a Ways and Means hearing on the bill.            &nbsp;   Ways and Means Committee Markup This week, on Tuesday, the Ways and Means Committee marked up the Fewer Cures for Patients Act, with the Democrats advancing the partisan bill out of committee along party lines. The Ways and Means Committee also marked up H.R. 4742&nbsp;&#151; a bill that would put an excise tax on the nicotine in e-cigarettes and vaping devices. I offered an amendment to address the very serious health crisis of vaping related illness. Click the video below to watch.&nbsp;            &nbsp;  I also introduced H.R. 4716 which would require certain high deductible health plans to cover the cost of inhalers for the treatment of any chronic lung disease, including asthma, before the plan&#8217;s deductible is met. This bill&#8217;s addition of inhalers is similar to President Trump&#8217;s efforts to expand preventative services for HSAs. I am proud of the members of the Ways and Means Committee who worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass this bill out of committee.            &nbsp;   Military Academy Nominations It is my honor to nominate students from Georgia's Third District to the United States Service Academies.

NBA Silences GM After Pro-Hong Kong Tweet   The NBA employs an egregious double standard. They are okay when members of the league are critical of America. But not okay when members are critical of China. Here are a few examples:  (1) The NBA boycotted North Carolina over their bathroom policy, but they're silent when China puts Muslims in internment camps.  (2) The NBA was fine letting players protest police brutality on the court, but police in Hong Kong shot protesters with rubber bullets (and in one case a real bullet), tear gas and water canons against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators. (3) And this May, when asked about players criticizing Trump, NBA's Adam Silver responded, \"This is America.\" But when Houston Rockets' General Manager Daryl Morey posted a meme showing support for Hong Kong, the NBA pressured him to apologize.

Adam Schiff Deserves To Be Censured   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) knew of the whistleblower allegations in August. His committee helped file the whistleblower complaint as the CIA changed the whistleblower standards, he fabricated a part of the president's phone call, then played dumb and subpoenaed for the complaint he helped file.&nbsp;  Adam Schiff deserves to be censured, but last night&nbsp;Congressional Democrats sent a loud and clear message that you can lie and get away with it. By striking down the censure resolution, they impugned not just the impeachment inquiry but the entire U.S. House of Representatives. From the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, to the treatment of SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and now these fake impeachment inquiries, Schiff is the first of many who should be held accountable for their bad actions.&nbsp;Click here to watch my full interview with Lou Dobbs.

Beto&#8217;s Plan an Outrageous Assault on the First Amendment   At a recent televised town hall, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke called for religious institutions to lose their tax-exempt status if they disagree with him on same-sex marriage. CNN's Don Lemon asked O'Rourke, &#8220;Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities &#150; should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?&#8221; Without missing a beat, O'Rourke emphatically said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; This is an outrageous assault on the First Amendment and our country's beautiful tradition of religious freedom. O'Rourke's proposal, in addition to being unconstitutional, would pit churches with millions of American members against the U.S. government.

Chinese Communist Propaganda on Capitol Hill   The House and Senate Postal Operations services distribute several American newspapers to Congressional staff every day. These newspapers are provided for free by outlets like the Washington Post and National Journal. However, an outside newspaper logistics company, the National News Agency, delivers a separate list of publications to Congressional offices, bypassing normal Congressional media distribution procedures. One of those newspapers is the China Daily, an English language project by the Chinese Communist Party to, in the words of Xi Jinping, &#8220;tell China&#8217;s story well.&#8221;  As we learn more about the economic and military threat China poses to the United States, it is completely inappropriate that Chinese-funded propaganda is proliferating in the halls of Congress. Every single morning, each member of Congress finds a copy of China Daily on their doorstep. If we can&#8217;t win the information war in Congress, how can we hope to win it anywhere else? I recently sent a letter&nbsp;to the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, Philip Kiko, to find out why and how this propaganda arrives at our doors.&nbsp;Click here to read my full letter.   Student Veteran Protection Act Last week, Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) and I introduced the bipartisan Student Veteran Protection Act. The bill would change how GI Bill overpayments are reimbursed by making schools, not student veterans, responsible for reimbursing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for GI Bill overpayments.&nbsp;  Veterans have already sacrificed so much for our country, they shouldn&#8217;t be forced to deal with the bureaucratic process of repayment. This common-sense and bipartisan bill would ensure veterans won&#8217;t have to endure unnecessary financial hardship or bureaucratic red-tape.  A 2015 GAO report that found the VA identified $416,000,000 in overpayments under educational assistance program during fiscal year 2014, affecting approximately one in four veteran beneficiaries and about 6,000 schools.  By making overpayments the responsibility of schools instead of students, schools would return overpayments directly to VA, instead of sending the payments to students who would then be responsible for reimbursing VA.

Seniors Warned of New Social Security Scam  Con artists are calling Mainers claiming that their Social Security number has been compromised and used by someone else. In another version of this scam, Mainers are told that their Social Security number has been suspended and that there is a warrant for their arrest. Sometimes these scammers may pose as Social Security personnel by &#8220;spoofing&#8221; victims&#8217; caller ID to make it appear as though they are calling from a Social Security office. Never give out personal information to an unsolicited caller.&nbsp; Anyone who receives such a call should immediately hang up.&nbsp;&nbsp; This scam can also be reported to the Aging Committee&#8217;s Fraud Hotline at 1-855-303-9470.      Senator Collins Secures Nearly $15 Million to Remove Lead Hazards in Maine Homes   The cities of Lewiston, Portland, and Biddeford and the Maine State Housing Authority received a total of $14,813,466 to address lead hazards in Maine homes.&nbsp; The funding was awarded as a result of the advocacy of Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee. &#8220;Lead poisoning poses a great threat to families that do not have the resources to afford costly lead abatement programs,&#8221; said Senator Collins.&nbsp; &#8220;Since the beginning of my Senate service, I have worked to raise awareness and secure funding to address this largely preventable health problem, which remains one of the most prevalent environmental issues facing children today.&nbsp; This funding, which I strongly advocated for, will help eliminate lead hazards in hundreds of homes, making them safe for Maine families.&#8221; Click HERE to read more.   World&#8217;s Largest 3D Printer and Largest 3D Printed Boat Unveiled at UMaine   Senator Collins attended a ceremony at the University of Maine to help unveil the world&#8217;s largest 3D printer and christen a 25-foot, 5,000-pound 3D printed boat named 3Dirigo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center received three Guinness World Records for the world&#8217;s largest prototype polymer 3D printer, largest solid 3D-printed object, and largest 3D-printed boat.  UMaine is partnering with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s largest science and energy laboratory, to research using wood fiber for large-scale 3D manufacturing.&nbsp; This project will strengthen environmentally responsible advanced manufacturing throughout America as well as the forest-products industry in Maine.

The new training vessel, known as a National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV), will provide increased training capacity on a state-of-the-art training platform for cadets at MMA. State of Maine, is almost 30 years old and the oldest ship in the fleet is more than 55 years old.&#8221; Senator Collins strongly opposed the Administration&#8217;s proposal earlier this year that requested $205 million to construct an inadequate training vessel that would not have provided sufficient capacity for MMA.&nbsp; In addition, changing the design would have required the U.S. Maritime Administration to start from scratch in designing a brand new ship.

Groundbreaking for New Business District at The Downs in Scarborough Attended by Senator Collins   Senator Collins delivered remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony of The Downs&#8217; Innovation District, a 150 acre commercial-light industrial subdivision located in the center of Scarborough. With its mix of business and commercial uses, it is projected that The Downs will eventually host more than 3,000 jobs.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Downs is the vision of two sets of brothers and life-long friends&#151;the Risbaras and the Michauds&#151;who purchased this land in their hometown in 2018.&nbsp; Once completed, the project will host Scarborough&#8217;s future Town Center, preserve 200 acres of greenspace, and create 10 miles of recreational trails that connect to a mixed-use residential area that will include single family homes, condominiums, and affordable housing.   Senator Collins Attends 65th Annual Forestry Field Day   Senator Collins delivered remarks at the 65th Annual Forestry Field Day, which was held at Newell Tree Farm in Unity.&nbsp; The event, which was co-hosted by Maine Tree Farm Program and Maine Woodland Owners, celebrated the achievements of the 2019 Outstanding Tree Farmer of the Year, Don Newell, and his family. The event featured wagon and walking tours of the woodlot to explore the management and stewardship of the property.&nbsp; Senator Collins is a member of the Senate Working Forests Caucus. &#8220;Congratulations to Newell Tree Farm on being named the 2019 Outstanding Tree Farm of the Year!&#8221; said Senator Collins.&nbsp; &#8220;In contrast to most of the United States where forests are publicly held, 95 percent of Maine woods are privately owned.&nbsp; These landowners, like Don Newell and his family, serve as the caretakers of the natural resources that are vital to our forest products industry and recreation economy.&nbsp; Thank you to the Maine Tree Farm and Maine Woodland Owners for their efforts to uphold the Maine tradition of providing public access to private lands and to preserve our state&#8217;s beautiful forests for generations to come.&#8221;&nbsp; Click HERE to read more.&nbsp;   Bangor YMCA CEO Diane Dickerson Testifies about Healthy Aging at Senator Collins&#8217; Invitation  At the hearing, Diane also made the exciting announcement that the Bangor YMCA is partnering with The Jackson Laboratory and the Alzheimer's Association, Maine Chapter, to launch the Brain Health Initiative, which will help Alzheimer&#8217;s patients and their families.

Senators Collins and King Rededicate Maine Lobsterman Statue   On Maine Avenue along Washington, D.C.&#8217;s, waterfront, Senators Susan Collins and Angus King celebrated National Lobster Day by participating in a rededication ceremony of the Maine Lobsterman Memorial.&nbsp; The statue was first brought to D.C. and placed near a fish market in 1983.&nbsp; When the area recently underwent a significant redevelopment, Senator Collins coauthored a bill requiring the Memorial to be displayed in a prominent position. &#8220;Once hard to find and surrounded by overgrown shrubbery, the Maine Lobsterman now kneels proudly with his catch on the pier adjacent to the bustling fish market, greeting visitors and reminding them of the importance of the Maine lobster industry to our state and the country as a whole,&#8221; said Senator Collins.&nbsp; &#8220;As the industry faces a number of challenges from changing ocean conditions to retaliatory tariffs, this statue reminds us of who the industry is built upon and who the delegation stands in support of &#150; hardworking Mainers and their families.&#8221; The Maine Lobsterman was sculpted by Victor A. Kahill, a Lebanese immigrant and Mainer.&nbsp; The artist modeled the statue after Harpswell lobsterman H. Elroy Johnson, who frequently visited the Maine State House to participate in discussions on fisheries policy.&nbsp; National Lobster Day was established through a resolution introduced by Senators Collins and King that passed the Senate in August.

Subsequently, Turkey began attacking our Kurdish allies in the region. The dangers of withdrawing U.S. forces from northern Syria outweigh the benefits to American security interests. Nevertheless, I believe a sanctions regime will strengthen the hand of the Trump administration to negotiate with Turkey. This is why I am supporting Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen's (D-Md.) bipartisan Countering Turkish Aggression Act of 2019, which would levy heavy financial penalties against Turkey following their invasion of northern Syria. The legislation would apply new sanctions to senior Turkish officials, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, key Turkish banks, military transactions, and energy sector activities in support of the Turkish Armed Forces. The sanctions would remain in place until the administration certifies to Congress that Turkey has halted attacks against the Syrian Kurdish community, has withdrawn from all locations that they didn't occupy prior to the October 9, 2019 invasion, and is not hindering counterterrorism operations against ISIS. Making History for American Sikhs In my travels throughout southeast Pennsylvania, I've had the privilege of meeting many hard-working Sikh constituents. This week, I was honored to welcome Sikhs from Pennsylvania and across the nation to Washington D.C. for a special morning prayer and evening reception as they celebrated the 550th anniversary of the birth of Sikhism's founder, Guru Nanak. At my invitation, Giani Sukhvinder Singh, a Sikh religious leader from the Philadelphia Sikh Society Gurdwara and resident of Millbourne (Delaware County), became the first Sikh to deliver the morning prayer in the Senate chamber. In the evening, I joined the Sikh community for an Interfaith Conference to foster understanding and acceptance of different faiths. I was happy to help facilitate these events for our Pennsylvania Sikh friends and neighbors. The Sikhs' close-knit and vibrant communities are part of the rich cultural fabric of Pennsylvania. I enjoyed celebrating Guru Nanak's 550th birthday with them. Read more about the day here. Honoring World War II Icons World War II profoundly changed the course of history and required the mobilization of our entire country. I recently cosponsored two bills honoring two great World War II icons -- Merrill's Marauders and Rosie the Riveter. As a long-range penetration special operations jungle warfare unit, Merrill's Marauders fought in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese. The Merrill's Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act directs the Treasury Department to strike a gold medal commemorating this unit for their heroic feats during World War II. Pennsylvania was home to 164 of the original Merrill's Marauders members - the highest of any state. Similarly, the Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal Act honors the cultural icon that galvanized women to join the workforce and assist with the war effort by directing the Treasury Department to strike a gold medal. The medal would honor not only Rosie the Riveter, but all the women who joined the workforce during this time. The members of Merrill's Marauders represented the bravery and determination that propelled the Allied troops to victory. While those brave men fought abroad, women all across the nation were inspired to join the workforce due to the iconic image of Rosie the Riveter. By honoring this cultural icon, we enshrine the contributions of those women. Introducing John Gallagher This week, Senator Casey and I introduced John Gallagher, a nominee for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, before the Senate Judiciary Committee. John Gallagher is an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where he is the Chief of the Allentown Branch Office. Before joining the United States Attorney's Office, Mr. Gallagher held leadership positions in both the Miami and Philadelphia Police Departments and also served as a New York City Police Officer. Mr. Gallagher earned his B.S. from Long Island University and his J.D. from New York Law School. His many years as a federal and state prosecutor and law enforcement officer will serve him well as a judge. I am confident he will be an impartial jurist who treats everyone fairly. I am particularly glad Mr. Gallagher will be filling a seat in the Allentown federal courthouse. Since 2011, Senator Casey and I have worked together, in a bipartisan fashion, to fill vacancies on the federal bench in Pennsylvania. Together we have now vetted, recommended, and confirmed 23 Federal District Court Judges for Pennsylvania.

Despite the increased partisanship that has been created by the Speaker&#8217;s efforts to move their impeachment inquiry behind closed doors and out of the public view, I remain committed to focusing on the issues and priorities of the Sixth District. Hong Kong Legislation:&nbsp;  As Ronald Reagan once said, &#8220;America is a shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere.\" The United States will always stand for democracy, and the citizens of Hong Kong have taken to the streets in support of a fairer society. The desire to live in freedom leads individuals to do heroic acts in the face of certain condemnation, and I applaud the people of Hong Kong for using their voice to spur positive change.        Impeachment:  When Congress sought to impeach Presidents Nixon and Clinton, it was done with bipartisan support and in a transparent and fair fashion before the American people. Unfortunately, the Majority is pursuing impeachment behind closed doors and re-writing the rules to remove due process protections.&nbsp;At the expense of fundamental fairness, the Majority is pursuing impeachment at all costs and have let fall by the wayside the issues that matter most to the American people like passing the USMCA trade agreement, repairing the country's crumbling infrastructure, and fixing our broken immigration system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drug Pricing:  Congress should take action immediately to encourage lower prescription drug prices and better enable Americans to afford the medications they need. That is why I am the lead cosponsor of the Terminating the Extension of Rights Misappropriated Act (TERM Act). This bipartisan legislation would allow for the quicker introduction of generic medications to the marketplace by ending the practice of &#8220;evergreening&#8221; by the pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s H.R. 3, which passed in the Education and Labor Committee this week, would use socialist price controls to crush the pharmaceutical industry, deter innovation, and dramatically reduce the ability of patients to access life-saving medicines. Further, this legislation could cost Virginia roughly 7,200 jobs and nearly $1.8 billion in yearly economic output. I am hopeful that we can address the problem of high prescription drug prices in a bipartisan way moving forward.&nbsp;         Constituent Meetings:  As Members of Congress, one of the great privileges we have is meeting with constituents both in the District and here in Washington. This week, a number of Sixth District residents visited my office to advocate on behalf of causes that matter most to them. Some constituents discussed increasing funding for muscular dystrophy research, others asked for support for the&nbsp;College of Osteopathic Medicine at Liberty University, and one family from Roanoke simply stopped by to tour the Capitol. It is always great to have a bit of the Valley in Washington and to have an opportunity to hear my constituents&#8217; concerns. My door is always open.&nbsp;        For the latest updates from Washington, please follow my social media accounts:&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter, and&nbsp;Instagram.

This process has been secretive and baseless since day one. Speaker Pelosi has lost control of her party and the House Intelligence Committee Chairman leading the impeachment charge has lied to the American people. That is why I joined my friend Representative Andy Biggs and many of my Republican colleagues this week to push our resolution condemning and censuring Representative Adam Schiff for his false retelling of the phone conversation between President Trump and the president of Ukraine in a recent hearing, for spreading false information about the Trump campaign and Russia, and concealing his dealings with the whistleblower. Here is the text of our resolution: \"Condemning and censuring Adam Schiff, Representative of Californias 28th Congressional District Whereas, President Trump released the transcript of a call between him and the President of Ukraine; Whereas, President Trump subsequently released the whistleblower complaint of August 12, 2019; Whereas, in a September 26, 2019, hearing on the whistleblower complaint, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff purported to relay the content of the phone call to the American people; Whereas, instead of quoting directly from the available transcript, Chairman Schiff manufactured a false retelling of the conversation between President Trump and President Zelensky; Whereas, this egregiously false and fabricated retelling had no relationship to the call itself; Whereas, these actions of Chairman Schiff misled the American people, bring disrepute upon the House of Representatives, and make a mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chambers most solemn constitutional duties; Whereas, for more than two years, Chairman Schiff has spread false accusations that the Trump Campaign colluded with Russia; Whereas on March 20, 2017, then Ranking Member Schiff read out false allegations from the Steele dossier accusing numerous Trump associates of colluding with Russia; Whereas, then-Ranking Member Schiff falsely claimed in a March 2017 interview to have more than circumstantial evidence of collusion with Russia; Whereas, then-Ranking Member Schiff negotiated with Russian comedians whom he believed to be Ukrainian officials to obtain materials to damage the President of the United States politically; Whereas, according to a New York Times article on October 2, 2019, Chairman Schiffs committee staff met with the whistleblower prior to the filing of his complaint and staff members communicated the content of the complaint to Chairman Schiff; Whereas Chairman Schiff concealed his dealings with the whistleblower from the rest of the Intelligence Committee and, when asked directly in a television interview whether he had any contact with the whistleblower, he lied to the American people and said, we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. Whereas, members of the Intelligence Committee have lost faith in his objectivity and capabilities as Chairman, with every Republican member on the Committee having signed a letter calling for his immediate resignation as Chairman; Whereas, Chairman Schiff has hindered the ability of the Intelligence Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities of the Intelligence Community, an indispensable pillar of our national security. Resolved, That The House of Representatives censures and condemns Representative Adam Schiff for conduct that misleads the American people in a way that is not befitting an elected Member of the House of Representatives; Representative Adam Schiff will forthwith present himself in the well of the House for the pronouncement of censure; and Representative Adam Schiff will be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.\" I've called for a vote on this resolution as soon as possible. The American people deserve the TRUTH. THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING On this episode of Buddys Briefing, we discuss Speaker Pelosis drug pricing bill that tanked bipartisan efforts to lower prescription drug costs, the situation in Syria, and the Democrats continued impeachment sham. Click here to check out episode 5. Click here to watch this episode of Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXXXVIII Monday, October 14, 2019: Folds of Honor is a national foundation whose mission is to provide educational scholarships to spouses and children of our fallen and disabled service-members. Their motto is - \"Honor their sacrifice. Educate their legacy.\" One of the many ways this great organization achieves this noble goal is through golf tournaments and today I am honored to participate in one of the largest Folds of Honor golf tournaments in Georgia at the Savannah Country Club on Wilmington Island in Chatham County. Organized locally by Dave Simons, I am honored to participate in the opening ceremonies by not only welcoming the golfers but also leading the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag. Also participating in the opening ceremonies is the St. Andrews School chorus who do an outstanding job of singing America the Beautiful and The Star-Spangled Banner. Later in the day I attend a meet and greet on Skidaway Island hosted by the Skidaway Island Republican Club. Tuesday, October 15, 2019: After an early morning flight, Im back in Washington and spend the remainder of the morning in staff meetings before recording a video for Veterans Day. Next, I meet with representatives from JCB, including my good friend Chris Giorgianni, to discuss tariff issues that could potentially impact the Savannah plant before beginning a series of interviews with potential candidates for a position on our Washington staff. Rep. Carter meeting with representatives from JCB Afterwards, I head to the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee room where I record a video on the upcoming National Prescription Drug Take Back Day then head back to my office where I meet with representatives from the Pharmaceutical Printed Literature Association. Rep. Carter meeting with representatives from the Pharmaceutical Printed Literature Association Next, I head to the House Visitors Center (HVC) for a GOP member update on the unprecedented and illegitimate impeachment inquiry that is being undertaken by House Democrats before heading to our weekly Whip Team meeting where we hear from U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper regarding the situation in Syria. Rep. Carter recording a Public Service Announcement for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day After recording a video for the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC) for the rollout of our health care framework, I head to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day and afterwards, remain in the Chamber to pay tribute to my good friend from Brunswick, Dr. Pat Godbey, who has recently been sworn in as the President of the College of American Pathologists. A link to my tribute can be found here. Wednesday, October 16, 2019: My day begins with a member meeting of the E&C Committee where we discuss tomorrow's mark-up as well as other anticipated agenda items for the full committee and sub-committees in the upcoming weeks. Afterwards, I head to our weekly GOP Conference before heading to an E&C joint Communications and Technology (CT) and Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPAC) Subcommittees hearing on fostering a healthier internet. A link to my questions can be found here. Next, I have a meeting with representatives from the pharmaceutical manufacturers to discuss Part D restructuring before heading to a hearing in the E&C Health Subcommittee on reversing the youth tobacco vaping epidemic. A link to my questions can be found here. After attending the conservative RSC weekly meeting, I head back to my office where we have our weekly staff briefing before heading to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day. Next, I head to the HVC where we have a GOP House member meeting with Sen. Lindsey Graham to discuss the latest on the ongoing unprecedented and illegitimate impeachment initiative before heading to the Capitol Rotunda where I film this weeks Buddys Briefing. After returning to my office for a scheduling meeting, I head to the Senate where I participate in a roundtable discussion on climate change with Conservation International, a group whose mission is to empower societies to responsibly and sustainably care for nature, our global biodiversity and the well-being of humanity. Among the board members of Conservation International who attend the meeting are actor Harrison Ford and retired Wal-Mart CEO Rob Walton. Thursday, October 17, 2019: There is a cloud of sorrow over the Capitol this morning as we learn of the death last night of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the hard fighting and well-respected Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. I served on this committee my first session in Congress and worked closely with then-Ranking Member Cummings on an issue that we shared a common interest in - prescription drug pricing. I found Rep. Cummings to be a fair and honorable man. His district and our nation will miss his leadership greatly. A link to coverage on my statement of Rep. Cummings' passing can be found here. My morning begins early with a hearing in the Select Committee on Climate Change on cleaner, stronger buildings where I have the opportunity to highlight the State of Georgias role as the number one forestry state in the nation and the importance of wood products to absorbing carbon in our atmosphere. A link to my questions can be found here.  Rep. Carter at the E&C mark up on health care bills Afterwards, I head to an E&C full committee markup on four health care bills, including H.R. 3, Speaker Pelosis prescription drug price bill, as we begin at 10:00 a.m. and debate and vote on the various amendments and substance of these bills until 8:00 p.m. The only interruption during this marathon session is a vote series at 1:45 p.m. Of the four bills that we debate and vote on, we spend 9 hours and 40 minutes on H.R. 3 and 20 minutes on the other 3 bills. H.R. 3 is controversial to say the least and passes on a purely partisan vote with myself and my fellow Republicans voting against it for fear that not only will this lead to a halt in new drug development due to a stop in research and development, but also is the first step toward socialized medicine. A link to some of my comments during this mark-up can be found here. Friday, October 18, 2019: Im at the White House early this morning as Im assisting some constituents to gain access on what is a beautiful Fall morning in our Nations Capital. Once back at the Capitol, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to Ludowici Mayor Pro-tem Mark Cheeser, who recently passed. A link to my tribute can be found here. After heading back to my office, I return to the Chamber a little while later for our first and only vote series of the day during which we pay tribute to our dear friend, Rep. Elijah Cummings. After a return flight home to Savannah, I head straight from the airport to Richmond Hill where I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to the Richmond Hill football team before their game and to perform the coin toss as the Wildcats faceoff against the Glynn Academy Red Terrors. Next, I head to the annual Great Ogeechee Seafood Festival at J.F. Gregory Park where, like so many who have come before me, I stuff myself with some of the best seafood anywhere.

Keep scrolling for the latest from the U.S. Senate this week, and click here or the image below to watch my weekly video message.&nbsp;   Wild and Wonderful West Virginia I spent the first two weeks of October back home in West Virginia, which was great! I had the chance to visit with constituents from all across our state and hear about how the work we&#8217;re doing in Congress is affecting them. From ways programs in our state are playing a role in creating drug-free communities, to how industry professionals and community leaders are working to increase tourism in our state, it was great to hear so many stories and ideas. What&#8217;s important to West Virginians is important to me, and this feedback is critical as I continue to advocate for West Virginia priorities in Washington. Click here or the image below to watch a quick recap of my visits around our beautiful state.    Advocating for West Virginia Priorities Earlier this week, Senate Democrats&#8217; introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule&#151;a commonsense alternative to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan (CPP). West Virginians know all too well how devastating the Clean Power Plan would have been to our energy economy. That&#8217;s why I strongly supported the ACE Rule as an alternative, because it allows states and energy producers to reduce emissions at an achievable pace without cutting back on jobs or economic growth. That&#8217;s also why I voted against the Democrats&#8217; effort to block the ACE Rule, which would have meant a revival of the devastating Clean Power Plan. West Virginians don&#8217;t have to choose between a clean environment and a thriving economy. We demand both; and with the ACE Rule, we can achieve both. Click here to read my full statement and click the image below to watch my floor remarks urging my colleagues to vote against this resolution.  Also on Wednesday, I advocated for our West Virginia miners on the Senate floor where I again urged my colleagues in Congress to act soon to protect the pensions of our nation&#8217;s retired coal miners. I have worked in a bipartisan way with others in the delegation, as well as my colleagues here in the Senate over the past several years to support legislation that stabilizes the mine worker pension fund and protects these men and women. These hardworking men and women deserve the pensions that they were promised, and we should make sure they receive the benefits they earned by passing legislation to protect their pensions this year.

Click here! &nbsp; &nbsp;                                          Dear Cormack,  Following a busy week in Washington, here with a few important updates and information on a number of key issues.&nbsp;   A Better Deal for America's Students  Whether it&#8217;s learning new skills through a certificate program, community college, or university, a post-secondary education has never been more important to securing a good career. It&#8217;s also never been more expensive. That&#8217;s why this week, along with my colleagues on the Education &amp; Labor Committee, I helped introduced the College Affordability Act (CAA) (H.R. 4674), a bill that would overhaul our higher education system to lower the cost of post-secondary education, simplify the student loan repayment process, protect veteran-student borrowers, and ease the burden of student debt that millions of Americans are facing so that they can begin to participate in our economy in other ways. The benefits of making college more affordable and accessible aren&#8217;t just limited to the students earning the degrees &#150; our entire economy will benefit from a more qualified workforce, and from Americans who aren&#8217;t saddled with such a crushing amount of college debt.&nbsp;  Included in the CAA are several provisions that I&#8217;ve worked hard to advance with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle of the Education &amp; Labor Committee. For example, the CAA would help to ease student debt by allowing for current borrowers to refinance their loans down to today&#8217;s more competitive market rates &#150; precisely what was proposed in my bill, the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act (H.R. 1707).&nbsp; The CAA also improves the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program by establishing a much-needed oversight and appeals process at the Department of Education, and expands the program to additional Veterans&#8217; Service Organizations and farmers, which is what we proposed in the Young Farmers Success Act (H.R. 3232), a bill I introduced in June. The CAA is good for veterans in other ways, too &#150; the bill would finally close the 90-10 loophole, which currently incentivizes shady for-profit schools to aggressively recruit our Armed Services members and veterans because their G.I. Bill benefits and Military Tuition Assistance are not counted toward their federal dollar maximum.&nbsp;  The College Affordability Act will save Americans money, create new opportunities for folks to access post-secondary educations that they previously may not have been able to afford, and will help better align our system of higher education with changing demographics and industry demands. I&#8217;m proud to support the bill, and look forward to working in bipartisan fashion to get it across the finish line.&nbsp;&nbsp;        Click here to watch Congressman Courtney discuss the recently introduced College Affordability Act     Lowering Prescription Drug Prices for Millions of Americans  The cost of healthcare, particularly the cost of prescription drugs, is a top-line issue for people in eastern Connecticut, and for millions across our country &#150; we're paying drug prices that are nearly 4 times higher than other countries for the exact same prescription drugs, made by the exact same manufacturers. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a co-sponsor of H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a bill that was just recently introduced that would give Americans a better deal on prescription medication by allowing for Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for fairer, lower drug prices &#150; the kind of prices they offer to other countries, but not to us. Yesterday, my colleagues and I on the House Education &amp; Labor Committee voted to approve the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a major step forward that sets the bill up for a final vote by the full House.&nbsp;  Last week, my newsletter was focused squarely on how the House of Representatives is working to lower the cost of prescription medication. We're waging that fight on two major fronts: the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act (H.R. 987), a bill the House already passed in May which would help bring lower-cost generic drugs to market more quickly; and H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a bill to finally allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate the best deal possible for American patients, and bring our prices more in line with what patients in other countries pay. Yesterday&#8217;s committee approval of H.R. 3 brings us one step closer to passing the bill here in the House, and I&#8217;ll keep working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the House continues to get the job done on lowering the cost of health care. Watch some of my remarks from yesterday&#8217;s committee markup below.&nbsp;        Click here for Congressman Courtney's remarks during the House Education &amp; Labor Committee hearing on the Lower Drug Costs Now Act     Protecting Social Security  Earlier this month, Social Security announced that recipients will receive a 1.6% cost of living adjustment (COLA) increase to their annual benefits in 2020. The bottom line is that a 1.6% increase doesn&#8217;t come close to covering what seniors need. It&#8217;s true that any COLA increase is welcome news, but this announcement was a stark reminder that the system is fundamentally flawed &#150; the current method of measuring necessary benefit adjustments for Social Security just doesn&#8217;t take into account the true costs incurred by seniors, and COLAs like this aren&#8217;t keeping pace with the real value of a dollar. It's another reminder of why we need to pass Rep. John Larson's bill, the Social Security 2100 Act, which would implement a new and improved COLA method that measures the real-life costs of seniors, and would protect benefits for the next 75 years and beyond. The bill also provides an increase in benefits, reforms the cost of living increase formula to better reflect a senior citizens&#8217; budget, and would give over 12 million Social Security recipients a tax cut by eliminating the tax on their benefits.&nbsp;  Social security is not an entitlement &#150; it&#8217;s an insurance program paid into over the course of a lifetime. I&#8217;m proud to co-sponsor the Social Security 2100 Act, you can read more about the bill here.&nbsp;    Support for the Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act&nbsp;  This week, I was grateful that the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) organization and the American Veterans (AMVETS) organization both joined the growing chorus of endorsements from veterans&#8217; service groups in support of my bill, the Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act (H.R. 566). The bill addresses a gap in our VA system that overlooks some Vietnam and Korean War Veterans who were exposed to the toxic chemical known as Agent Orange during their service, and who are now living with serious illnesses caused by that exposure. The system in place now requires that servicemembers demonstrate that the symptoms of their illnesses developed within a year of exposure in order to receive care &#150; a totally unrealistic and onerous requirement to place upon veterans who should be focused on recovery, not on digging up decades-old documents to get the care and compensation they deserve. H.R. 566 eliminates these onerous and unfair requirements, and would give all servicemembers who were exposed to the pesticide access to the benefits they&#8217;re entitled to.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Both DAV and AMVETS are organizations made up of thousands of veterans serving other veterans &#150; they are strong advocates for the millions of men and women who served our country. Their support and that of local veterans like Gerry Wright, who have done so much to raise support for H.R. 566, is critical to getting this bill across the finish line.

Res 77, a resolution to rebuke President Trump&#8217;s decision to withdraw U.S. troops in northern Syria, effectively abandoning our Kurdish allies in the region. Kurdish forces in northern Syria have stood with America against ISIS when we&#8217;ve needed it most &#150; they've sacrificed alongside US troops, and to abandon them with no plan in sight is to abandon decades of American leadership in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I joined Congressman Jason Crowe (CO-06), a combat veteran who served three tours in the Middle East, and 56 of my colleagues in the House in writing to President Trump to warn that his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria in advance of a known Turkish military operation puts U.S. allies in danger, and harms ongoing counter-ISIS efforts. You can read the full letter here.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to withdraw U.S. personnel from the area is penny-wise and pound-foolish &#150; U.S. military forces had a small presence in the area to begin with, but the cost of withdrawing them is steep. The decision dramatically alters our partnership with our Kurdish allies, who we rely on to guard thousands of ISIS prisoners, makes way for uninhibited Turkish incursions into Syria, and jeopardizes counter-ISIS efforts. The decision introduces uncertainty into U.S. foreign policy that will cause current and future allies to question the reliability of the U.S. as a partner, and invites further instability in this region. I was glad to see the House come together in bipartisan fashion this week to condemn the decision, and to express support for our Kurdish allies.&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney presides over the House floor during the vote opposing troop withdrawal from Northern Syria     I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and, as always, thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update.

North Long Beach Neighborhood Associations My team and I hosted a lunch and chat with the leadership of the North Long Beach Neighborhood Associations. Had a chance to provide a great group of engaged CA44 residents an update on my work in this Congress and to talk about the constituent services my office provides. Also discussed: redistricting, infrastructure along the Artesia Corridor, the 2020 Census, immigration, LA County voting and more. Meeting with neighborhood associations is vital to my ability to serve our district. So, if I havent yet met with yours yet, PLEASE INVITE ME out! Hispanic Heritage Month and the High Holidays These last two weeks also saw the conclusion of Hispanic Heritage Month, the annual celebration of past leaders of the Latino community who paved the way forward for this current generation.

NHAs promote cultural, natural and historic sites of importance in Northeast Florida and will boost our local economy.

John Rutherford, Al Lawson Jr. and I announced new legislation to make Northeast Florida a National Heritage Area. The Nation&#8217;s Oldest Port National Heritage Area Act will preserve our history, environment and bring tourism and jobs to our communities.

This week I visited Super Petrel USA&nbsp; in Ormond Beach and flew in one of their amphibious test planes&nbsp;over the Halifax River, met with local veterans at the Daytona Beach Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic, discussed the&nbsp;Institute for Water and Environmental Resilience with Stetson University President Wendy Libby and spoke at the Tiger Bay&nbsp;Club of Volusia County.

For the latest episode of Undercover Congressman, I joined the United Sates Postal Service as a mail carrier! I learned all about the hard work that goes into delivering mail to our community, rain or shine! There are over 340,000 mail carriers in the U.S. Did you know that 100,000 of those are veterans and 40% of mail carriers are women? I love visiting local businesses and living a \"day in the life\" of my constituents. So far, I've delivered packages with UPS, served chicken sandwiches and waffle fries at Chick-fil-A, dipped ice cream for customers at Dairy Queen, hand-tossed pizza dough at Giuseppe's Steel City Pizza and delivered mail with the USPS.

Liz Cheney in the House and Lindsey Graham in the Senate on bills imposing sanctions on Turkey. The decision to withdraw our specialized forces in Northeastern Syria is an enormous risk for our national security because now our Kurdish allies have no support to fight ISIS. Instead, they are fending off the Turks and ISIS prisoners are escaping as we speak. I'm very troubled by the situation in Syria. With more ISIS fighters on the loose, we could easily see a resurgence of terrorism and an ISIS 2.0 following us home. I'm working with Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Lindsey Graham on a sanctions package to punish Turkey for invading Northeast Syria. We must show support for our Kurdish allies and do what we can in Congress to stop Turkey's aggression in Syria.&nbsp;   Click below to watch me discuss Syria and sanctions against Turkey in full:    &nbsp;  As a reminder, please follow my daily work on social media by&nbsp;liking my&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;page, and&nbsp;following me on&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram.&nbsp;As always, feel free to reach out to my offices in Florida or Washington, D.C. if we can ever be of service.

Here's a recap of my work for our district:  &nbsp;    Getting Results for Our Veterans  &nbsp;  On Tuesday, the House passed my bill to make health care more accessible to veterans with disabilities. The VA Website Accessibility Act would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study and submit a plan to Congress that would make VA websites accessible and understandable for veterans affected by blindness or hearing loss.  Our servicemembers put themselves in harm&#8217;s way to protect American freedom. It is only right that Congress uphold our end of the promise by giving disabled veterans the care they earned. I&#8217;m grateful the House has advanced my effort to eliminate barriers preventing some of our bravest men and women from receiving quality medical care, as well as disability, vocational, and educational benefits.  &nbsp;     Watch as I speak in support of my bill to help veterans with disabilities.  &nbsp;    Leading Efforts to Protect Our Chesapeake Bay  &nbsp;  Last week, I met with my office&#8217;s Chesapeake Bay&nbsp;Advisory Board to inform our region&#8217;s stakeholders about my legislative efforts to&nbsp;improve the health of&nbsp;the Chesapeake Bay.  Last month, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed my bill -&nbsp;Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act -&nbsp;and recommended it for a vote in the full House of Representatives.  We also discussed how I advocated for the House passage of $110 million in funding for important environmental priorities. This funding included $85 million for the Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay Program.  &nbsp;  The Chesapeake Bay is an invaluable economic, environmental, and recreational resource that we must keep clean and thriving for future generations. I will continue to lead bipartisan efforts to preserve and protect this national treasure.  &nbsp;   It was great to meet with my office's Chesapeake Bay Advisory Board and discuss how we can keep the Chesapeake Bay healthy for many&nbsp;years to come.  &nbsp;    Standing By Our Allies  &nbsp;  After the President decided to withdraw U.S. forces from the Syria-Turkey border and abandoned our Kurdish partners in the process, I demanded clarification on the President&#8217;s strategy.  As Turkish forces conducted an offensive military campaign into northeastern Syria, I joined over 50 fellow lawmakers in asking for answers. Together, we wrote a letter with 10 detailed questions about the administration&#8217;s plans going forward. We stressed that the U.S. has a national security&nbsp;and moral responsibility to maintain a presence in Northern Syria and support our Kurdish Syrian Democratic allies.  The President&#8217;s decision betrays the trust of the United States and undermines the security of our faithful Kurdish allies. In real time, the President is degrading America&#8217;s ability to respond to resurgent ISIS actions and future regional threats in the Middle East.  &nbsp;    It was a pleasure to show French Ambassador Philippe Etienne around the USS JOHN C STENNIS with Vice Admiral Andrew &#8220;Woody&#8221; Lewis. Aircraft carriers are the centerpieces of our maritime strategy and critical to our national security.  &nbsp;    On a lovely Thursday afternoon, I toured Colonial National Historial&nbsp;Park on the Peninsula and met with National Park Service leadership. This beautiful park has a rich history and offers therapeutic benefits to all. We&#8217;re so lucky to have it in our community!  &nbsp;    I enjoyed meeting Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3160 in Oceanview.

The trip was part of an initiative by the Bipartisan Policy Center&#8217;s Congressional Exchange Program to bridge the partisan divide and build relationships between Members of Congress. Even though Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers and I may not agree on 100% of the issues, we found that there is a lot that unites us.   Video: Rep. Trone and Rep. McMorris Rodgers discuss rural broadband  Manufacturing In honor of National Manufacturing Day, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers and I toured Accra-Fab, Inc., Kaiser Aluminum, and Hotstart - three manufacturing plants in Eastern Washington. Manufacturing is key to creating good jobs and lasting economic growth for Americans. The Congresswoman and I are both committed to advocating for the hardworking people of our districts.  &nbsp; Rep. Trone and Rep. McMorris Rodgers pose for a selfie and visit Accra-Fab, Inc. to learn about production and jobs  Rural Broadband Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers and I are also united on the issue of rural broadband. Broadband is essential infrastructure for education, health care, and businesses. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a proud cosponsor of the Congresswoman&#8217;s Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2019, which would revamp the mapping process so federal and private providers can better service our rural communities.  Thank you to Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers for hosting me and to the Bipartisan Policy Center for sponsoring this trip. When we come together to work toward common goals, we can create positive change for all Americans.  As my team and I continue to work on the issues that are important to you, don&#8217;t forget to follow my official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram pages to stay in touch and let me know how we can do better.

I always enjoy seeing this beautiful creativity on display in my office and this year was no exception. We held our annual exhibition at the district office in Ballwin to meet the students who entered this year&#8217;s competition and announce the 2019 Best in Show award. Congratulations to Mia Kukorola from Lindbergh High School for winning this year&#8217;s prize. Her artwork will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol!  I met with local advocates from the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association to hear their personal experiences with Alzheimer&#8217;s and discuss ways we can partner together. Over five million Americans are living with Alzheimer&#8217;s and there is still a long way to go on the path to discovering scientific breakthroughs in prevention and effective treatment. I appreciate their dedicated advocacy as we work to fund research for cures and treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s.  This week I joined my colleagues and Gold Star mothers to honor the sacrifices made by their children in service to a nation that is forever grateful. Gold Star mothers are women of great conviction and have bravely experienced incredible hardship. As moms we advocate and fight for a strong America that can defend our freedoms and support those who put themselves in harm&#8217;s way.  I strongly support legislation protecting patients with preexisting conditions. Unfortunately, legislation the Democrats put on the floor this week was a political ploy that had nothing to do with preexisting conditions. Rather, it would reduce innovation in the healthcare field and hamstring a state&#8217;s ability to reduce premiums and help people access tailored healthcare plans. We should be working to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible to Missourians and all Americans, not restrict states that are trying to address the specific needs of their citizens. A standalone bill to protect individuals with preexisting conditions could pass right now, and I am a cosponsor of such legislation. But Democrats instead are passing legislation that would lead to raised premiums and ignoring bipartisan bills that would protect those with preexisting conditions. I cosponsored Rep. Walden's bill to protect those with preexisting conditions, H.R. 692, the Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act of 2019. I met with constituents from the Missouri Association of Insurance Agents to discuss how important it is that the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is extended by Congress and not allowed to lapse. Extending NFIP will better protect homeowners and stabilize the housing market, and I am also committed to reauthorizing and reforming the program so it can best serve Missourians.   I spoke at a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee hearing on China&#8217;s attempts to erode America&#8217;s influence through predatory trade and investment practices. In Missouri, exports support 88,000 jobs, almost 20% above the national average. China must be held accountable for its damaging trade policies, but we must be targeted and ensure that American consumers and business do not shoulder the consequences.&nbsp;   This week I spoke at our Financial Services Committee markup in support of Rep. Carolyn Maloney&#8217;s beneficial ownership legislation that fights human trafficking and exposes criminals who make money from exploitation. Traffickers launder money through shell companies and too often evade criminal liability. It is essential we have a transparency law to expose those who are profiting from trafficking.   &nbsp;Sincerely,   Ann WagnerMember of Congress                                        Washington, DC Office435 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515Phone: 202-225-1621    Ballwin District Office301 Sovereign CourtSuite 201Ballwin, MO 63011Phone: 636-779-5449               Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email If you no longer want to receive these emails, please click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to unsubscribe.&nbsp; Please DO NOT reply to this email.

Click here to read my article. We must expand telehealth for veterans By Rep. Earl L. \"Buddy\" Carter The 1st District of Georgia has a rich military heritage and one of my greatest honors is serving the service members and veterans in Southeast and Coastal Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives. Although a couple hours from home, many of our veterans travel to Charleston, S.C., or Lake City, Fla., in order to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital and medical facility. I, too, often visit these facilities to see how we can improve the care these heroes receive. On a recent visit to the Charleston facility, we discussed a number of barriers that are standing in the way of better care for veterans. One serious concern is the VAs current limitations on telehealth. The VA Mission Act, which I was proud to support in Congress and was later signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017, reformed multiple programs at the VA. It overhauled the Veterans CHOICE Program, improved the veterans caregiver program and aimed to modernize the VAs health care facilities. Additionally, the VA Mission Act authorized the VA to provide telehealth services across state lines. This is critical because these VA health facilities are now able to give care to veteran patients in the First District without forcing those veterans to travel hours to South Carolina or Florida to be seen by a physician. However, while were making important strides in telehealth at the VA, there is still a big problem. While at the Charleston VA medical facility, I learned that only doctors are allowed to use telehealth systems and trainees are not permitted to use the program. Just like in any health care system, students, interns, residents and fellows are critical components of the VA. They use these professionals in every aspect of care. These medical providers have graduated medical school and are training to become full-time doctors. They need access to the telehealth system so they are able to get the experience necessary to provide the best possible care to veterans once they are fully licensed. Additionally, allowing this population of health care professionals to use the telehealth system will increase access to this important care by increasing the number of providers. That is why I introduced H.R. 3228, the VA Mission Telehealth Clarification Act in the United States Congress. My legislation authorizes trainees to use the telehealth program under the supervision of an appropriately credentialed VA medical professional. This will allow better access to VA health care as well as better prepare future doctors to use the system. Our veterans served our nation and deserve access to the best possible care when they return home. Increasing the use of telehealth at VA health centers is critical to ensure veterans are able to receive the care they need no matter where they live. The VA Mission Telemedicine Clarification Act is only one small step to improve the health care system for veterans, but it is an important step that should be taken immediately FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXXXVII Monday, October 7, 2019: Now in its fourteenth year, the Buddy Walk, sponsored by the Lowcountry Down Syndrome Society (LDSS), is held in Forsyth Park in downtown Savannah every year and this past Saturday drew thousands of people. LDSS is a family support group for people in the greater Savannah and Lowcountry area that have been touched by Down syndrome. I was very proud to join my brothers from the Band of Brothers on Saturday as we supported our good friend and fellow member Joe Marchese and his beautiful daughter Ella at the Buddy Walk. Rep. Carter at the Buddy Walk This is a special event for me, as well, as I grew up with an aunt who had Down syndrome and have fond memories of the joys and challenges my grandparents had raising a child with Down syndrome. My Aunt Jean was an integral part of our family. She was always accepted and included everywhere we went. I can still remember my family going out to eat at Williams Seafood in Savannah with my grandfather in his suit and tie with his arm extended and my Aunt Jean holding on as if he were walking her down the wedding aisle. Later Saturday morning I was able to stop by the Georgia Republican Leadership Academy held at the American Legion Post 184 in Thunderbolt to speak to them. On Sunday afternoon I was back at Forsyth Park as I attended one of the best events anywhere, Picnic in the Park, Savannahs largest outdoor musical event. Rep. Carter at Picnic in the Park Sponsored by the City of Savannah and others, this beloved event featured not only students from local schools and colleges, but also the US Army 3rd ID band and, of course, the world-class Savannah Philharmonic. What a great event! Im in Atlanta today as I have a number of meetings in the area before joining Governor Brian Kemp and others at the Georgia GOP 2019 Chairmans Dinner. Tuesday, October 8, 2019: After arriving back home late last night, my first event of the day is at the Georgia Tech Savannah Campus as I speak at the Georgia Alternative Fuel Vehicle and Clean Technology Showcase and share with them my experiences as a member of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee. As a member of the E&C Environment Subcommittee as well as the Select Committee on Climate Change, we have considered many bills dealing with autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, compressed natural gas vehicles, and much more. Rep. Carter at the Georgia Alternative Fuel Vehicle and Clean Technology Showcase Afterwards, I head to our Savannah office where I have a very productive meeting with a representative from the Savannah Freedom Society followed by a meeting with representatives from Twin Pines Minerals regarding their proposed project in Charlton County. Next, I meet with representatives from Coastal Empire Habitat for Humanity to learn more of the great work they are doing in the Savannah area before heading to Hinesville in Liberty County to meet with constituents from Liberty and Long Counties. Afterwards, I head to Cogdell in Clinch County where I meet with a number of constituents from the area. Wednesday, October 9, 2019: Im up early this morning as I head to the Coastal Heritage Society Battlefield Memorial March in downtown Savannah where we honor those who fought and sacrificed for our freedom on the 240th anniversary of the Battle of Savannah during the Revolutionary War. Rep. Carter at the Coastal Heritage Society Battlefield Memorial March The Battle of Savannah was one of the Revolutionary Wars most pivotal battles and is where Gen. Casimir Pulaski was killed. Complete with soldiers clothed in uniforms from that period who marched along the same path as the original battle, participants laid wreaths in Battlefield Park during a commemorative ceremony. Afterwards, I head out to Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool in Bryan County where I read to a group of preschool classes in celebration of Georgia Pre-K Week.  Rep. Carter with students at Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool Of the three books that I read, I have to say that my personal favorite was Llama, Llama Red Pajama. Afterwards, I head to midtown Savannah for a meeting with a constituent before heading to the Savannah Area Realtors Luncheon at the Hellenic Center in downtown Savannah where I am honored to be their guest speaker.  Thursday, October 10, 2019: Im at Lake Raybun in North Georgia this weekend for my youngest sons wedding and this morning I have a conference call with my good friend Col. Daniel Hibner, Commander of the Savannah District of the US Army Corp of Engineers, to discuss a project in the district. Later, I have a phone interview with The Capitol Forum to discuss new Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rules that are being proposed that would give the agency the authority to review non-controlling investments in 28 new categories, including some in the chemical industry. Afterwards, I have a phone conference with representatives from JCB in Savannah to discuss new tariffs being levied by the administration that could potentially negatively impact their business.

As beautiful fall weather marks the start of harvesting season, I hosted my annual farm tour this week, with stops ranging from Ozark to Pine Bluff. This tour is always a highlight of my year, since farmers and ranchers are the lifeblood of both our state and national economy. One of the topics that came up frequently was levee breaches and flood damage from earlier this year. I got to see the sand that's covered part of a farmer's fields and visit a flooded pump station with the Army Corps of Engineers, and I know how much this damage has negatively affected farmers' ability to plant and harvest in a timely fashion. Of course, the question is, \"What happens now?\" We began talking through local solutions with the Corps during a Farm Bureau meeting in Paris, and I'm also working on the Water Resources Subcommittee in Washington to address infrastructure issues on the federal level. To learn more about each of my stops this week and see photos, keep reading below. I have the utmost respect for farmers in Arkansas and across the country who dedicate their lives to working the land, and it's my honor to meet you and represent you in Congress. Until next week, Bruce Westerman Arkansas' Fourth District *By subscribing to my email updates, you are authorizing me to send regular email updates from my office to your email account. *Visiting with a constituent in Mulberry* **2019 Farm Tour** I started the week in Mulberry at USDA grant kickoff event. Mulberry and Waldron are two communities in the Fourth District that USDA selected to receive Rural Community Development Grants. FFA taught me so many incredible life skills, and I could talk for hours about what I learned from the program. Ozark High School [link 2] was kind enough to let me speak to their FFA students as part of my farm tour. Like I mentioned, flood damage has severely impacted our crops this year. James Patterson of Patterson Soybean Farm showed me aerial footage of how the flooding affected his farm in Lavaca. Big River Roller is a new manufacturing business in Paris, and I stopped by for a tour while I was in the area. Colonel Eric Noe with the Army Corps of Engineers showed me the flood damage to a pump station in McClean Bottom. He also pointed out several of the breached levees in the region. This tour will be helpful to me as I work on policy in the Water Resources Subcommittee. I visited Fourche River Farm and Cattle Co. in Harvey. The Hickl family welcomed me into their home to talk about the challenges and opportunities that come with cattle farming. True southern hospitality! I met with the Jefferson County Farmers Working Group at Dell-Cam Farms, which is owned by the Goldmon family. The Goldmons are the 2019 Farm Bureau Farm Family of the Year in the Southeast District! I held two roundtable discussions with the Arkansas Farm Bureau, one in Paris and one in Pine Bluff. We discussed labor issues, trade negotiations and infrastructure issues. I wrapped up my tour at a Tyson's chicken processing plant. Not only does this location provide hundreds of jobs to the area, but it also represents the last stop in an agriculture chain that spans the entire state. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] Contact Information: Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC 209 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-3772 Fax: (202) 225-1314 El Dorado 101 N.

Maloney Dear Lindsey, I love being home here in NYC during District Work Periods because I get to spend time hearing directly from you about the issues you care about and what you want to see me working on when I return to Washington, DC. This past week was a busy one! On Monday, I joined community leaders in mourning the four homeless men who were brutally murdered and speak out on behalf of New Yorkers experiencing homelessness. On Tuesday, I assembled a roundtable with experts to talk about the importance of reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. And last night, I hosted an Impeachment 101 Town Hall with special guest former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. More on all this below. *Homeless Slayings Vigil* [image = On Monday, I joined Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou and the Chinatown community to mourn the deaths of four innocent men after a brutal attack that also left another man in critical condition. This tragic incident makes it all too clear that the city needs to do more to protect the 60,000 New Yorkers experiencing homelessness, including thousands of especially vulnerable unsheltered individuals. I promise to continue to fight for comprehensive federal programs to help individuals find and retain adequate and safe housing. Without the protection and privacy of a home, our homeless neighbors face a much greater risk of violence. Everyone has the right to the safety and dignity of a home, and we must do everything we can to guarantee that right to every New Yorker. *TRIA Roundtable* [image = The magnitude and importance of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act cannot be overstated. TRIA provides critical government backup to private insurers in the event of a terrorist attack and is especially vital to the economy of New York City. After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, insurers realized that they could not accurately model for terrorism risks because they simply did not have all the information they needed to predict where a terrorist attack is most likely to happen, and how likely it is to occur. As a result, the market for terrorism insurance completely shut down. Without terrorism insurance, construction stopped and thousands of jobs were lost. And so, Congress came together in a bipartisan way to pass TRIA to provide a government backstop to ensure that terrorism insurance was not only available but also affordable - at no cost to taxpayers. We need to do the same now before the program expires at the end of next year. We cannot afford to let TRIA lapse and run the risk of high-target cities like New York losing construction jobs and the other economic benefits that come from new building projects. That's why I hosted a roundtable meeting this Tuesday with Rep. Nydia Velazquez, Rep. Gregory Meeks, and industry stakeholders to discuss how TRIA is working now, what improvements could be made in reauthorizing this legislation, and when Congress needs to act. TRIA is one of the most important issues before Congress and it must be renewed without disruption to coverage or lapse in renewal. *Impeachment Town Hall* [image = Thank you to everyone who joined me and former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman last night in Brooklyn for our Impeachment 101 Town Hall! I felt it incredibly important to host an event where concerned New Yorkers could engage in a dialogue about the future of our democracy and learn more about the impeachment process. As one of the nation's strongest voices during the impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon, I'm grateful that former Brooklyn Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman was able to join us for this discussion and share her perspective. President Trump is jeopardizing our national security, in plain sight, and abusing his power for personal political gain. The oath of office that each Member of Congress makes requires us to take this solemn step to protect our democracy and defend the constitution. The seriousness of the impeachment investigation cannot be underestimated. *Snapshots from NY-12* * [image = Great to join the friends and loved ones of Cono D'Alto in Brooklyn on Saturday at his street naming ceremony. He was a dedicated businessman who provided food to families in need after 9/11, and I am so glad I got to present his family with a Congressional certificate recognizing his contributions to the community. [image = I was honored to participate in the 39th Annual Korean Day Parade on Saturday and celebrate the beauty and richness of Korean culture and the many contributions Korean Americans have made to New York!

Hello all, It&#8217;s been wonderful to spend a beautiful couple of weeks visiting with you and working across the district as the leaves change. This week, I got to meet with the local leaders who are pushing for investments in transportation and infrastructure, tour small businesses in Northfield, and continue my healthcare listening tour to hold the vaping industry accountable. These are just a few of the big issues I hear from you about and am working to address. Through my work in Minnesota and in Washington, I am always looking for bipartisan, common-sense ways to work across the aisle to improve lives for our neighbors. In fact, to date, I have introduced 13 bills and cosponsored 261 more - 79% of which are bipartisan. Working across the aisle doesn&#8217;t make the cable news, but it&#8217;s important to me because it&#8217;s important to our community. If these are the kinds of ideas and efforts you are also passionate about, be sure to apply for an internship in my DC or Burnsville offices! Applications are open for spring 2020 internships. Follow this link to find out how to apply. In the District  Celebrating young farmers: This week is National 4H week! CD2 is home to so many dedicated 4H-ers working for a bright future for Minnesota&#8217;s ag economy.     Bringing nutrition to schools: This week, I was proud to announce the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;of the Farm to School Program. Our kids deserve healthy and nutritious foods, no matter where they live, and by bringing together Minnesota farmers, school districts, and community partners, Farm to School creates meaningful community ties and healthier schools across Minnesota. I highly encourage schools in my district to apply for these grants to connect more students to our farming community. More information on how to apply can be found here.  Investing in airport infrastructure: The Minneapolis St. Paul Airport employs hundreds of folks from CD2 and helps connect Minnesotans to the rest of the world. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter Defazio and I are committed to providing the resources they need to operate with world class safety and service. We toured the Minneapolis St. Paul Airport this week and heard from officials with the Metropolitan Airports Commission about the need for critical infrastructure improvements - including a unified incident command center.     Touring small businesses: Northfield is full of thriving businesses and friendly neighbors. Thanks to Sen. Tina Smith for spending an afternoon with me touring businesses and talking to folks about economic development in Northfield and Greater Minnesota.    Fighting for a fair shot: Thanks to Commissioner Steve Kelley from the Minnesota Department of Commerce for meeting with me earlier last week - looking forward to working together with you to lower health care costs for all Minnesota families!    Fall weekend in Cannon Falls: Fall in Minnesota is best spent in Cannon Falls. I got to spend an afternoon at the Ferndale Market&#8217;s Flavors of Fall Festival and grabbed some turkey products for the road!    Putting Minnesotans first: I sat down with Esme Murphy this past week to talk about my bipartisan work to improve the lives of Minnesotans and my responsibility to hold all of our elected officials accountable. Watch here.&nbsp; Supporting local credit unions: Thanks to the folks at Firefly Credit Union for giving me a tour and for talking about the ways my fellow Small Business Committee Members and I can help grow our economy and improve the work of the Small Business Administration.     Building stronger infrastructure: I took a tour of the Hastings Lock and Dam with the St. Paul Army Corps of Engineers and Colonel Karl Jensen! This infrastructure is critical to the river economy that Minnesota farmers, businesses and families rely on for exports and imports to our communities.    Keeping kids safe: The vaping industry has put our kids&#8217; health at risk. As part of my healthcare listening tour, I held a roundtable with doctors, school, and community leaders on how we can work together to reduce teen vaping and hold the e-cigarette industry accountable for this public health crisis.

Click here! &nbsp; &nbsp;                                          Dear Cormack,  As I&#8217;ve traveled across eastern Connecticut in the past weeks, a concern that is often relayed to me by folks from all walks of life is that the cost of prescription medications have become so great, and have risen so quickly, that it&#8217;s making them sick &#150; both figuratively and&nbsp;literally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman from Vernon told me that the cost of one of her medications was more than 9 times as much in 2019 than in 2016, and that when she called her insurance company to inquire about the price increase, she was told that in fact she should have been charged more. A man from Sterling wrote to my office with news that the cost of his generic medication had risen by over 1000% in a calendar year. Another from Old Lyme said that the cost of his eye drops had risen by over 12,000%, with no explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rising cost of prescription medication is a top-line issue for folks here in eastern Connecticut, and for millions of Americans across the country. This week, I want to talk with you about what we&#8217;re doing in the House to curb the skyrocketing costs of prescription medication, and to give Americans a better deal.&nbsp;   Americans Aren&#8217;t Getting a Fair Deal on Medication  We know that one of the biggest concerns people have about the stability of their care is the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. 24% of Americans&nbsp;say that they&nbsp;didn&#8217;t fill a prescription last year due to high costs, and 19% say they skipped a dose or cut pills in half because they&#8217;re so expensive.&nbsp;These statistics are playing out right here in eastern Connecticut. Just recently, a woman from&nbsp;Eastford told me that the copay for her husband&#8217;s medication was $1,300 a dose, and that for the first time in their lives they were choosing to forgo doctor-prescribed medication because of cost.&nbsp; Patients in the U.S. pay drug prices that are nearly&nbsp;four times higher&nbsp;than other countries for the exact same prescription drugs,&nbsp;sold by the exact same drug manufacturers. For Americans, the&nbsp;prices are rising without rhyme or reason. Last month at a House Education and Labor Committee hearing on the rising cost of prescription drugs, witnesses confirmed that Americans&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;from pediatric patients&nbsp;to&nbsp;seniors on Medicare&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;are being exploited by ridiculous spikes in drug prices, and that the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. has exploded to a whopping 25% of premium dollars.          Lowering Prescription Drug Costs, Now  Drug manufacturers are using Americans&nbsp;as a piggy bank, and it&#8217;s time for it to end. That&#8217;s why I was proud to join as cosponsor of H.R. 3, the&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act,&nbsp;a bill just recently introduced in the House that would change the law by finally allowing for Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for fairer, lower drug prices&nbsp;&#150; the kind of prices they offer to other countries, but not to us.&nbsp; As it stands now, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is banned by law from negotiating with big pharma for better, fairer prices. The&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;would instruct the Secretary of HHS to negotiate fair prices for some of the most expensive prescription drugs, helping to lower costs for millions across the country. These&nbsp;lower prices would be available not just to Medicare beneficiaries, but also to those with private insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill also prohibits manufacturers from raising their prices faster than inflation, and requires that they pay back profits on drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries if they do. Also under this bill, Medicare would cap the amount that patients spend on prescription drugs for the first time ever &#150; a huge savings for seniors with high drug costs. Last month, my committee held a productive hearing on strategies for lowering prescription drug costs and heard from experts and patient advocates who are asking Congress to pass the&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act. You can&nbsp;click here&nbsp;to watch my exchange with our witnesses.&nbsp;        Click here to watch Congressman Courtney's exchange&nbsp;at the House Education &amp; Labor committee hearing on prescription drug costs last month     Encouraging Competition for Lower Prices  The&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;is a crucial step towards making sure that Americans are given a fair deal, but it isn&#8217;t the only step we&#8217;ve taken to curb the&nbsp;rising&nbsp;cost of prescription medication. We've already passed&nbsp;bipartisan&nbsp;legislation this year that takes the issue head-on.&nbsp; In May, I voted to pass H.R. 987, the&nbsp;Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act. This bipartisan bill tackles another aspect of unfair prescription drug pricing by helping lower-priced generic drugs get to market faster,&nbsp;offering Americans more low-cost options to choose from. Getting more low-priced prescription drugs into the market is a key way to create billions of dollars in savings for American consumers and taxpayers &#150; in 2017 alone, the entry of generic drugs into the market saved us a&nbsp;total of $265 billion. That&#8217;s good for our wallets, but certain drug manufacturers are using anti-competitive practices to keep lower-cost alternatives off of our shelves. They keep generic manufacturers from obtaining samples of drugs to create alternatives, they purposefully delay the introduction of their own drugs to market, and they even pay&nbsp;off&nbsp;generic drug manufacturers to make sure that their high-cost drugs are the only ones we see on our drug store shelves.&nbsp;&nbsp; H.R. 987 takes the issue head-on, and would finally put an end to many of these calculated practices that are contributing to the exploding cost of prescription medication. It should be reiterated that this bill is bipartisan &#150; it passed the House with support from both sides of the aisle. However, it&#8217;s now among a long list of other House-passed bills that have not yet received a vote in the Senate. The bill is ready to go, waiting on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell&#8217;s desk.&nbsp;   The rising cost of prescription medication is&nbsp;a&nbsp;concern that&#8217;s on the minds of many of&nbsp;our family, friends and neighbors who struggle to pay for lifesaving, or even just routine treatments. With price tags that are on average four times higher than in other countries, it&#8217;s plain to see that Americans aren&#8217;t getting a good deal.&nbsp;With bills like the&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act,&nbsp;the House is working in bipartisan fashion to give Americans a&nbsp;fair deal when it comes to prescription drugs. I was proud to help pass H.R. 987 earlier this year, and&nbsp;I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting&nbsp;to pass H.R. 3, the&nbsp;Lowering Drug Costs Now Act,&nbsp;when it comes before the House for a final vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work&nbsp;to lower prescription drug costs.

LEGISLATION&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp;NEWSROOM      WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this week&#8217;s From the Front&#133; I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation&#8217;s capital, including Robert Martin of Centerton, the Clark family of Fayetteville, the Beecroft family of Rogers, the Crawford family of Harrison, and George and Rosemary Faucette of Fayetteville. Safe travels back to the Natural State!  It was another district work period, which means I got to spend time doing my favorite thing: traveling throughout Arkansas&#8217;s Third Congressional District!  I started my week in Centerton visiting some local small businesses and meeting with owners and employees. I stopped by Heroes Coffee Centerton and 72 West to learn about the companies and get a firsthand look at their operations. They are family-owned and operated and a great example of the entrepreneurial spirit of the Third District. Not only did I get a delicious cup of coffee, but I also saw a lot of hard work, ambition, and dedication to success. It&#8217;s important that the government doesn&#8217;t stand in the way of small business growth. We need to focus on implementing policies that further empower and create more opportunities for businesses to invest, grow, and create jobs.  I then headed to Bentonville to speak with the Wholesale Beer Distributors of Arkansas about the beer industry and its impact on jobs, the economy, and entrepreneurship. The beer industry provides millions of U.S. jobs, supports our economy, and is a sector that boasts businesses of every size. Arkansas has a strong beer sector; from brewers to distributors, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of success. I recently toured the Ozark Beer Company and heard firsthand how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed them to upgrade their equipment and hire additional staff. More brewers reinvesting in their companies also provides new opportunities for distributors. As companies grow and invest -&nbsp; distributors can do the same. We discussed the system between manufacturer, distributor, retailer, and consumer, as well as the importance of their work to promote responsible alcohol consumption. I appreciated their time, conversation, and thoughtful questions.  Our region is home to many people willing to give back and improve the well-being of Arkansans. It was a privilege to watch the George and Simmons families receive the Excellence in Free Enterprise Award, presented by Economics Arkansas. The award honors those whose business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit have improved the lives of countless Americans across our state and nation.&nbsp;Additionally, Dr. Jim Rollins, Superintendent of the Springdale School District, was also recognized for his 35 years of service on the Economics Arkansas Board of Directors. Congratulations to the honorees on their accomplishments and dedication to AR-3.  The next day, I headed down to Fort Smith for a Q&amp;A community meeting! We talked about a range of local and federal issues, including the national debt, infrastructure, economic growth, the partisan divide, and other challenges facing Congress. It's always great to be with city leaders, state representatives, the local fire department, and area educators!  Cancer is a word that changes everything. It&#8217;s a disease that not only impacts the person diagnosed; it also affects families, loved ones, and medical professionals.&nbsp;The Reynolds Cancer Support House provides cancer patients, survivors, and families with assistance&nbsp;and programs that make a difference in their lives. From patient emotional support and financial help, to transportation assistance and understanding treatment options, the facility brings hope and help to many going through the unthinkable. I was privileged to donate books to their library, which allows patients to get lost in a good story and spend some time reading.&nbsp;The Cancer Support House is changing lives, and I thank them for the work that they do each day. With October being manufacturing month, I headed over to Becko Machine Works. This manufacturing center integrates old fashioned machining experience and ingenuity with today's technology and innovation. They provide one-off parts and reproduction, welding, precision, general machining, milling, turning, and other services. I appreciated getting a firsthand look at their operation and meeting with employees on the floor. It&#8217;s always amazing seeing the work done in the district, and Becko Machine Works is providing products that help businesses throughout the River Valley and the U.S.   I wrapped up the week in Harrison, where I spoke at the John Paul Hammerschmidt Men of Distinction Award Ceremony. The event celebrates the legacy of public service that&nbsp;John exemplified by honoring men in the community who have shown great character and dedication to service. It was wonderful to celebrate those that have given back so diligently and selflessly for many years to Harrison and the surrounding area. Congratulations to the 2019 awardees, including Richard Hart, Mark Martin, Kevin Merrill, Joe Nance, Robert Shaddox, Jim Sprott, and Steve Turner. &nbsp;  Wishing Arkansas&#8217;s Third District a great weekend! Remember to keep an eye on my&nbsp;website&nbsp;or check out my&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.&nbsp;  Policy Update  As you may have heard, the Turkish military began an invasion of northeastern Syria and attacked the Kurdish forces who hold the area. This action was made possible by the withdrawal of the small number of U.S. forces who were in the region. Let me be clear, I think the decision to remove U.S. troops from the area was a mistake. The Kurds have been loyal allies who stood with us when others would not. Furthermore, removing U.S. forces from the area threatens the security of this volatile region and only empowers Iran, Russia, and - ultimately - ISIS.   Given my concerns with the situation, I have joined many of my colleagues in the House to support the introduction of legislation that will impose sanctions against Turkey in response to Ankara&#8217;s military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria. This move follows similar efforts led by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in the Senate.  President Erdogan and his regime must face consequences for attacking our Kurdish allies. These sanctions send a clear message: Congress won&#8217;t sit idly by as Turkey continues its destabilizing and reprehensible actions. Erdogan and his proxies must be held accountable for their misguided actions, and it is imperative that we implement these sanctions swiftly. &nbsp;  In addition to my support of these sanctions, I will also be looking at all potential options to protect our interests and those of our allies. In the coming weeks, Congress will be debating the annual defense policy legislation and, hopefully, the defense spending bill. During those negotiations, our nation&#8217;s security and the safety of our global partners will be at the forefront of my mind.    From the front...

Here is a recap of everything that happened throughout the last week.  &nbsp;    Securing a Pay Raise for Veterans  &nbsp;  I am happy to announce that that the President has signed into law my bipartisan bill bringing a much-needed pay raise to American veterans.  Starting on December 1st, my Veterans&#8217; Compensation Cost of Living Act will provide a cost-of-living increase for wartime disability compensation that mirrors the same increase as Social Security.  It&#8217;s a privilege to come to Congress and deliver much-needed support to our nation&#8217;s bravest men and women. Providing quality benefits to our veterans and their dependents can change lives.  Through this legislation, Congress is honoring its commitment to American heroes who served in harm&#8217;s way so that our nation can live in peace at home.  &nbsp;    Connecting with Coastal Virginians at Last Week&#8217;s Town Hall  &nbsp;  On Thursday night at New Hope Baptist Church in Virginia Beach, I fielded questions from constituents during our latest town hall. It was wonderful to engage with everyone, answer so many insightful and thoughtful questions, and point constituents toward helpful government agencies. I truly cannot thank everyone enough who made our town hall possible. I am especially grateful to the Virginia Beach Police Department for providing security and safety at the event, and to New Hope Baptist Church for lending us their beautiful&nbsp;space. Town halls are one of my favorite events to host because they allow me to connect with our community. While time constraints prevented me from answering every question, I look forward to sending responses soon.  &nbsp;    Meeting with VA Leadership to Advocate to Push for Better Care  &nbsp;  Recently, I met with David Collins, the new director of the Hampton VA Medical Center. We had a productive conversation about improving access for patient care, reducing wait times, and increasing patient satisfaction for veterans living in the Hampton Roads region. It&#8217;s clear that this change in leadership can have a positive impact for veterans in our community. I look forward to regularly meeting with Director Collins to ensure that our local veterans receive the best possible care.  &nbsp;    Opening New Doors for Veterans  &nbsp;  On Friday, I had the opportunity to attend and speak at the Grow with Google &amp; United Service Organizations (USO) Training in Virginia Beach. At this event, representatives from USO and Google facilitated networking opportunities and workshops to help veterans and their families develop skills, find jobs, and grow their careers. During my speech at the event,.  It was great seeing a service organization join forces with private industry to help our most heroic men and women. In today&#8217;s economy, it&#8217;s so important that we give veterans the resources they need to find fulfilling employment.  &nbsp;    Full house at our Virginia Beach Town Hall! Thank you to everyone who attended.  &nbsp;     On a fun Friday night, I attended the Kellam-Cox high school football game where I watched our talented #VA02 athletes and caught up with friends on both sides of the field.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      I enjoyed meeting with leadership of the Virginia Beach Volunteer Squad and thanking them for all that they do for our community.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    During our town hall, I had the opportunity to touch base with Michael Whiteside and his son. Previously, my staffer Caleb helped Michael with his naturalization application and he&#8217;s now a proud American!  &nbsp;     It was awesome to meet with my fellow U.S. Naval Academy alumni in Williamsburg!

Although deaths from breast cancer continue to fall, they&#8217;re declining at a slower rate than in previous years, and the number of cases we&#8217;re seeing is rising. It is very important that we take this valuable opportunity to talk about this dreaded disease and increase our knowledge on the topic.  The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be more than 271,000 new cases of breast cancer this year alone, 99 percent of which will be diagnosed in women. Of course, risk factors like age and genetics cannot be avoided, but there are steps you can take to lower your own breast cancer risk, and most of them are related to maintaining good health in general. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and getting regular screenings if you are older than 40.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, most of us have either faced a cancer diagnosis personally or been close to a friend or family member who has. Until we eradicate this terrible disease altogether, it is important to know about the resources available to those in the fight. Throughout my time in Congress, I have considered it a privilege to play in the Congressional Women&#8217;s Softball Game, a charity event benefiting the Young Survival Coalition (YSC). YSC aims to improve the quality of life for young adults affected by breast cancer. My team didn&#8217;t quite pull off a win during this year&#8217;s game, but I could not be prouder of what we accomplished. We raised more than $365,000 &#150; a new record &#150; to benefit YSC and their important mission supporting individuals battling breast cancer.  A cancer diagnosis is certainly never easy, but organizations like YSC make it possible to navigate these challenging circumstances, and I am grateful for their work. During the month of October, I encourage you to increase your own awareness about breast cancer and the risks associated with the disease and tell your loved ones to do the same. As with many other forms of cancer, early detection is critical and saves lives. If you are currently battling breast cancer, please know that my prayers are with you.&nbsp; SECOND DISTRICT RESIDENT WINS DUCK STAMP COMPETITION    Did you know waterfowl hunters created the Federal Duck Stamp in 1934 as a way to ensure a funding source to conserve habitats for ducks and geese? Now, 85 years later, sales of these beautiful stamps to hunters, bird watchers, outdoor enthusiasts, and collectors have raised more than $1 billion, which has been used to protect 6 million acres of wildlife habitat in the United States. A couple of weeks ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service held its annual Federal Duck Stamp competition at Patuxent Research Refuge in Laurel, Maryland, and Eddie LeRoy of Eufaula won for the first time with his submission of a black-bellied whistling-duck pair, pictured above. Congratulations to this Second District resident! LAST WEEK IN THE DISTRICT  Since Congress is out of session for a district work period, I had the opportunity to take several meetings in my Montgomery office last week. I was glad to sit down with several groups of constituents and Alabamians, including: Representatives from New York Life    UPS    Folks from M1 Technologies    Camille Place    Representatives with ALS Alabama    It is an honor to serve you in Congress.

Members of Congress headed back to their districts this week, and I couldn't wait to be home in Arkansas. I've lived here my whole life, but I am still finding new places to explore. This week's tourism tour was the perfect opportunity to visit some of the beautiful campgrounds, shooting ranges, parks and more that we often take for granted. Arkansas may not be the first place that comes to mind when people think about tourism, but the Natural State has such a variety of historic buildings and outdoor recreation opportunities to enjoy. Whether you are interested in rock climbing, horseback riding, skeet shooting or camping with family, you can find a place that is perfect for you in the Fourth District. I had such a great week visiting these locations, meeting the people who own and manage them and discussing how we can better improve access to public lands. Outdoor recreation and tourism are key to our state's identity, and we are fortunate to have great people on the ground ensuring these opportunities are accessible and enjoyable. We are so blessed to have these fantastic opportunities for tourism and recreation right in our backyards. As cooler temperatures head our way, I hope you are able to take some time to enjoy the beauty of the Natural State with family and friends this weekend!

Click here! &nbsp; &nbsp;                                          &nbsp;  Dear Cormack,  Following a busy start to the District Work Period spent across&nbsp;eastern&nbsp;Connecticut, I'd like to share with you some of the key visits and updates from this week.&nbsp; Highlighting&nbsp;National Manufacturing Day  Today, on National Manufacturing Day, I was joined by State Senator Norm Needleman for a visit to Sound Manufacturing in Old&nbsp;Saybrook&nbsp;to tour the facility and to hear from a few of their on-site employees. Sound Manufacturing is a full-service precision sheet metal fabrication manufacturer that helps to build high-powered machinery like leaf and debris truck loaders, industrial vacuums, and a variety of parts for use in a wide range of products.&nbsp;The&nbsp;company&nbsp;was recently recognized by The Hartford Courant as one of best workplaces in Connecticut &#150; an impressive feat for a deserving organization. Employing 77 workers from across the region, Sound Manufacturing offers quality, high paying jobs with comprehensive benefits while also promoting employee development and career growth. Organizations like Sound Manufacturing are a great example of how a businesses can flourish while also investing in their workers, and it was great to receive an update on their activity on National Manufacturing Day. From the new House-passed National Defense Authorization Act, to the groundbreaking on a massive new production facility on our coastline, to the recent data showing that eastern Connecticut is outpacing the state and the nation in terms of growing manufacturing jobs, there has been no shortage of good news for our region when it comes to manufacturing. Sound Manufacturing in Old&nbsp;Saybrook&nbsp;is an important part of eastern Connecticut&#8217;s impressive manufacturing portfolio. I&#8217;m grateful to President and CEO Kelli-Marie&nbsp;Vallieres&nbsp;for a chance to visit them this afternoon, and for her continued leadership in southeastern Connecticut&#8217;s small business community.        Rep. Courtney receives a tour of Sound Manufacturing from President &amp; CEO&nbsp;Kelli-Marie&nbsp;Vallieres     Update on Federal Funds for Crumbling Foundations&nbsp;  As many readers of this newsletter know, addressing eastern Connecticut&#8217;s crumbling foundations crisis and finding more resources to provide financial relief to its victims is one of primary focuses in Congress. This week brought news on both fronts. First, on Wednesday, the towns of Vernon, Ellington and Stafford hosted a&nbsp;community&nbsp;forum for homeowners&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn&nbsp;more about the&nbsp;new resources made available by the federal&nbsp;Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) pyrrhotite testing program. The program&nbsp;provides funding to homeowners for&nbsp;pyrrhotite testing, and&nbsp;at&nbsp;Wednesday&#8217;s forum folks had a chance&nbsp;to ask questions and receive personalized guidance on how to navigate the CDBG application process.&nbsp;&nbsp; I first identified these federal funds as a potential source of crumbling foundations aid back in 2016, and in March of this year I was glad to announce that Vernon, Ellington and Stafford had received approval for $480,000 in CDBG funding to support the testing of concrete foundations for pyrrhotite. This is a positive development, but it should be noted that although these CDBG funds&nbsp;can&nbsp;be used for testing, there is no federal mandate that requires them to be used&nbsp;solely&nbsp;for that purpose &#150; the State of Connecticut should get creative, and work to expand the use of these federal dollars so that they can provide relief to homeowners in other ways, too. Thanks to all who participated&nbsp;on Wednesday, and to the individuals who made this important informational event available to homeowners.&nbsp; In addition to the update on new federal resources, I visited Birth Grove Primary School in Tolland this morning for an update on the school&#8217;s efforts to chart a path forward after the discovery of the school&#8217;s crumbling foundation. I was joined on the tour by&nbsp;a team of researchers from Laval University in Quebec,&nbsp;who&nbsp;studied the effect of pyrrhotite in concrete following Canada&#8217;s own&nbsp;concrete foundations&nbsp;crisis, giving them a unique&nbsp;understanding of the impact&nbsp;that&nbsp;crumbling foundations can have on homeowners and communities. I&nbsp;was also glad to be joined by a representative from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), who will be conducting research on our crumbling foundations crisis thanks to my House-passed amendment that provides them with funding to do so. It was an important opportunity to have them all at Birch Grove this morning, and I want to extend a thank you to each of them for their valuable input and their continued&nbsp;support.&nbsp;        Rep. Courtney was joined by researchers from Laval University and a representative from NIST for a tour of Birch Grove Primary School     Bringing Farms to Schools&nbsp;  I had a great time on Tuesday at Charles Barnum Elementary School in Groton, where I was joined by representatives from&nbsp;Groton Public Schools for an update on the recent&nbsp;U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s (USDA)&nbsp;Farm to School&nbsp;(F2S)&nbsp;program,&nbsp;and the recent USDA grants awarded throughout our region&nbsp;that are making this&nbsp;curriculum&nbsp;possible.&nbsp; Both Charles Barnum Elementary School and Catherine&nbsp;Kolnaski&nbsp;STEAM Magnet School have implemented the&nbsp;collaborative F2S&nbsp;program,&nbsp;which connects schools with local farms to help students learn more about farming and sustainable agriculture, and to&nbsp;eat healthier&nbsp;by providing&nbsp;locally sourced food in school meals.&nbsp;And that's not all &#150;&nbsp;the F2S program also helps support&nbsp;our region&#8217;s farmers and their small businesses. F2S&nbsp;helps educate students on the importance of organic and nutritious diets, how to plant and garden, and brings farmers and educators in our community closer together to benefit our youth. It was great to see the program in action in Groton, and&nbsp;soon other eastern Connecticut&nbsp;towns&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;join&nbsp;in on this unique program &#150;&nbsp;just recently,&nbsp;my office helped facilitate more than $81,000 in federal fund grants awarded through USDA that will support F2S programming in the Thompson and Putnam School Districts.&nbsp; The USDA&#8217;s Farm to School program&nbsp;is great for our&nbsp;students, and for our farmers.&nbsp;I want to thank Groton public schools and the&nbsp;outstanding students at Charles Barnum Elementary for showing us how F2S is flourishing in eastern Connecticut.&nbsp;     Rep. Courtney visited Charles Barnum Elementary to see USDA's F2S Program in action     A Firsthand Look at Our Region&#8217;s Shellfish Industry&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a beautiful&nbsp;morning&nbsp;in Madison today as I was joined by Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt and State Senator Christine Cohen&nbsp;for&nbsp;a visit to&nbsp;Indian River Shellfish,&nbsp;a local, family-owned business who are busy farming some of the best oysters on the east coast. Owners&nbsp;George Harris and Mike&nbsp;Gilman gave us a behind-the-scenes look&nbsp;at&nbsp;how they farm their oysters and shellfish, as well as&nbsp;a tour of their primary farm in the lower&nbsp;Hammonasset&nbsp;River. George, a lifelong fisherman with a profound understanding of southeastern Connecticut aquaculture and shellfish growth, and Mike, who has dedicated his career to marine research and education, make the perfect team.&nbsp;George and Mike are impressive small business owners &#150; they're looking to put Connecticut on the map when it comes to the oyster market, and they&#8217;re busy in the community, working with the towns of Clinton, Madison and Old&nbsp;Saybrook&nbsp;to restore shellfish beds and oyster reefs.&nbsp;It was great to have the opportunity to discuss Connecticut&#8217;s aquaculture and shellfish industry with the two of them, and to get to witness a&nbsp;real&nbsp;professional&nbsp;farm&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the freshest oysters you can find.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to Mike and George for hosting us this morning, and I look forward to visiting again soon.        Rep. Courtney visited Indian River Shellfish to meet with owners Mike Gilman and George Harris     I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and, as always, thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update.

The SECURE Act contains an important provision that I introduced to provide relief to Gold Star Families that experienced drastic tax increases due to President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  &nbsp;  It is wrong that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act caused Gold Star Families to see a tax hike. The House did its job when it passed the SECURE Act with overwhelming support. Senator McConnell must stop stalling support&nbsp;America's most heroic families and schedule a vote for the SECURE Act now.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Introducing Legislation to Help the Victims of May 31's Tragedy  &nbsp;  Last week, I introduced the Virginia Beach Strong Act to help ensure donations to families of victims of the May 31 Virginia Beach mass shooting are tax-deductible.&nbsp; On May 31, our Virginia Beach community experienced an unspeakable tragedy that led to the loss of 12 wonderful people. In the wake of our community's darkest day, we saw countless selfless people donate to provide relief for grieving families.&nbsp; I am introducing this bipartisan and bicameral bill to make it easier to&nbsp;send more&nbsp;needed support to the&nbsp;grieving families.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Sending a Message to Congress: Fund Critical Defense Infrastructure Projects  &nbsp;  I led a bipartisan letter to the leadership of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, urging them to authorize critical funding for infrastructure&nbsp;projects in military communities. Our&nbsp;letter requested that the committees authorize the Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP) at $100 million.&nbsp; Last year Congress created the DCIP to assist state and local governments in tackling deficiencies in infrastructure. Unfortunately, Congress did not appropriate any funds to this program. DCIP grants can be used for projects that support military installations, but are outside of military installations.&nbsp;Examples include transportation development to ease traffic congestion and upgrades to hospitals, schools, utilities and more.&nbsp; As a Navy veteran representing Hampton Roads, I know&nbsp;our military communities desperately need funding for infrastructure projects to promote readiness. The DCIP is a critical and overdue investment for our country. These projects are vitally important to the strength of our national security infrastructure and to the welfare of our servicemembers and their families.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Upholding My Oath  &nbsp;  On a very sad day for our democracy, I called for the House to move forward with impeachment and issued the following statement: In the military and in Congress, I swore an oath to protect our Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. In recent days, credible information has emerged that President Trump sought to pressure a foreign government &#151; Ukraine &#151; to produce damning information on a political opponent. Furthermore, reporting suggests he threatened to withhold critical security assistance to Ukraine, a partner that is under direct assault from Russia, in exchange for the performance of this investigation. He put the foreign policy and national security of the United States at risk while doing so. This was clearly an attempt to leverage foreign involvement to bolster his reelection campaign and shows a total disregard for our democratic political process. It is clear to me that he has betrayed the public trust and abandoned his obligations to the Constitution by elevating his own interests over the national interest. Allegations of this gross misconduct meet the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors set by the Constitution. Congress must investigate and use the full extent of its powers to check these alleged abuses of presidential power. The House must move forward with impeachment.  &nbsp;  Throughout my career, I have made many hard decisions. You sent me here to make these choices and to do what's right for our nation.  &nbsp;    Photo Contest Winner  &nbsp;  I am pleased to announce the winning submission of our VA-02 Summer Photo Contest. Below is a beautiful snapshot of Mount Trashmore that caught my eye.  &nbsp;   Mount Trashmore is a&nbsp;unique Virginia Beach landmark that our community knows and loves. This photo captures a beautiful and especially picturesque day in VA-02. It hits all the right marks and more!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     It&nbsp;was great to meet Patrick Dempsey at the Congressional Families Cancer Prevention Program and to congratulate him on his great work for supporting families and caregivers fighting cancer.  &nbsp; &nbsp;      I am glad&nbsp;to share the stage at the Atlantic Festival with my friends, Congresswomen Chrissy Houlahan and Abigail Spanberger! It&#8217;s a privilege to serve with fellow women veterans and national security professionals in Congress.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    It&nbsp;was a pleasure to speak with Gold Star Families ahead of Gold Star Mother&#8217;s Day at&nbsp;The Library of Congress&nbsp;with my colleagues.

Presidential&nbsp;Impeachment: Reviewing President Trump's actions in office  My office received dozens of calls from angry constituents who support the impeachment of President Trump after press reports detailed Trump's threat to withhold foreign aid from Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky conducted a baseless investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.&nbsp;  On September 24th, House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would conduct a full impeachment inquiry of&nbsp;President Trump's actions to determine whether they violate his oath of office.&nbsp; Personally, I believe there is enough evidence to pursue articles of impeachment against this president already.&nbsp; But I do fully support this inquiry in order to present the facts, so my&nbsp;House colleagues can reach their own conclusions.  I am proud to be one of the original supporters of Rep. Al Green's resolution,&nbsp;H. Res. 498, which called for the impeachment of&nbsp;President Trump on July 17, 2019.    &nbsp;  Newark&#8217;s Water Crisis: Providing clean water to Newark's residents  I am extremely concerned about the elevated levels of lead found in Newark&#8217;s drinking water.&nbsp; After all, my family and I drink this water with the rest of the city's residents. The health and safety of constituents is my #1 priority. Right now, my team and I are working with city, state and national officials to&nbsp;help do what needs to be done to get lead out of the water.  But I wanted to see the issue personally, so I volunteered to help my constituents get clean water at two local distribution facilities.&nbsp; I was grateful to the staff at the Bo Porter Sports Complex and Boylan Street Recreation Center for what they do on a daily basis to help our community.&nbsp; I enjoyed meeting with my constituents to hear their concerns about this crisis.&nbsp;        Congressman Payne, Jr. chats with residents and helps distribute bottled water.    We talked about their fears of living with tainted water.&nbsp; I told them what I am doing to help, but also asked them if there were any other actions I could take to&nbsp;make sure a tragedy like this one doesn't happen again. There are many actions I've taken to try and solve the issue.&nbsp; I introduced the Test for Lead Act in Congress already.&nbsp; I co-signed and sent two letters: one to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (find it here) to urge them to provide more assistance to Newark and the other to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (find it here) to expand access to SNAP and low-income food subsidies to cover the additional costs of bottled water.&nbsp;  In addition, I&#8217;m working with my colleague Rep. Grace Napolitano,&nbsp;chairwoman of the Committee of Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment,&nbsp;to find out how we might be able to help the city with federal funding or other resources.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;I&nbsp;voted for&nbsp;legislation in the House that would allow communities the freedom to adjust their budgets to&nbsp;provide additional resources to their water treatment facilities in the event of an emergency.&nbsp; The legislation passed both U.S. Senate and the U.S. House and it needs President Trump's signature to become law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe federal funds are appropriate because what has happened in Flint, MI. and Newark shows that lead contamination from old pipes are a national concern. There are dozens of major cities and small communities across the country that could use an upgrade regarding the way water gets from the aquifers to the household faucets. If we solve Newark&#8217;s water infrastructure issues, we create an example and template we can follow when other cities suffer the same fate. Job Fair for Veterans: Introducing veterans to future employers  More than 100 veterans participated in my annual job fair on August 7th, the largest turnout we&#8217;ve had. Next year, we are going to look at larger facilities&nbsp;in our district to attract even more veterans and the companies that want to hire them. I was excited and grateful to give back to the men and women who have given so much to this country.        An Amazon representative discusses a future career with a veteran (8/7/2019)    Disaster Preparation and Emergency Response: Making sure we are prepared before, during and after a crisis  Last July, I wanted to see if our district was prepared to care for the underserved and most vulnerable people of our community during an emergency. We&#8217;ve seen how changes in our climate have increased the intensity of hurricanes and other natural disasters across the country. I don&#8217;t want what happened in Puerto Rico and New Orleans after they were struck by hurricanes to happen to us.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery of the Committee on Homeland Security, I held a hearing on the matter on July 23rd called &#8220;Protecting Every Citizen: Assessing Emergency Preparedness for Underserved Populations.&#8221; The hearing was held at the Mac Mahon Student Center in Saint Peter&#8217;s University in Jersey City, so it could be accessible to my constituents. The hearing gave all of us a better understanding of the needs of underserved or vulnerable populations before, during, and after a crisis. It was extremely informative to hear from researchers, emergency responders, and community groups regarding&nbsp;how we plan for and meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens before, during and after an emergency.   Increased Manufacturing Base: Creating more manufacturing jobs for New Jersey&nbsp;  No area of our economy has suffered job losses like America&#8217;s manufacturing base. In August, I spoke with members of a local Machinists&#8217; union about how we can increase the opportunities for workers affected by these job losses. The event is important because it gives me an opportunity to listen as well as speak about possible solutions to the problems that face our workers and communities.        Rep. Payne speaks to Machinists' union (8/6/2019)    Legislation:  I have&nbsp;introduced or signed on to support several legislative initiatives. I wanted to give you a brief introduction to just a few of those measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Payment Choice: Giving residents the choice to pay in cash  Recently, I heard that more businesses are trying to get rid of cash as a form of payment for goods and services. Companies say it will make it easier for consumers. In truth, it will make it easier for companies to secure transactions, reduce the risk of crime, and speed up the process to serve more customers and make more money.  While I applaud the innovation behind these technological advances, we must remember that they aren&#8217;t always good for everyone. Nearly 25 percent of Americans don&#8217;t have access to digital forms of payments, including credit or debit cards. If we eliminate cash payments, we eliminate the only&nbsp;option for these consumers, including seniors and low-income residents, to buy their groceries and pay for other goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is why I teamed with fellow New Jersey delegation member Rep. Chris Smith to introduce the &#8220;Payment Choice Act of 2019.&#8221; This bill would protect cash as a form of payment and require retailers to give consumers the choice to pay with credit cards, debit cards, or cash. The New Jersey State Legislature passed a similar law this year. I want consumers here and across the country to still be able to pay for items &#8220;the old-fashioned way.&#8221;  Return of Local and State Tax Deductions: Returning tax money to Americans  President Trump&nbsp;put a limit on the amount of state and local taxes that workers could deduct from their federal income tax.&nbsp; His Tax Cuts and Jobs Act caps the State and Local Tax deduction, also known as the SALT deduction, to $10,000. Previously, there was no cap on deductions.  This is a major concern for me because it hit the middle&nbsp;and lower class residents in&nbsp;our community the hardest.&nbsp; My&nbsp;constituents averaged more than $17,000 in SALT deductions last year.&nbsp; On average, this current law will deny taxpayers an additional $7,000 per year in deductions.&nbsp; I am working to repeal it, so the hard-working families of our 10th District can get that money back in&nbsp;their pockets.  Donald Payne, Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act: Giving patients more payment options for treatment  My father, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Sr., died of colorectal cancer. Even though his cancer is a preventable disease, his cancer screening happened too late to catch it in time. Sadly, his case was not unique.        Donald Payne, Sr.    One out of every four Americans between the ages of 50 and 75 fail to get screened for this deadly disease. African-American men are particularly vulnerable. They are 20 percent more likely to get colorectal cancer and 45 percent more likely to die from it than white men. The American Cancer Society recently found that incidences and deaths due to colorectal cancer are even increasing in people younger than 50.  On June 4th, I testified before the House Ways and Means Committee about my&nbsp;bill, The Donald Payne, Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act, because it would address this issue directly. Until recently, there were only two methods for colorectal cancer screening: colonoscopy and stool tests. Fortunately, there is a new test that can detect the disease with a simple blood draw. It can be done during a lunch hour in any facility that can draw blood. This test has the potential to significantly increase screening and save countless lives.  Another big issue with colon cancer is how to pay to fight it. Right now, Medicare will cover the screening, but not the treatment. If doctors find cancer cells and a growth, they must wait until the patient recovers from the screening to ask if they want the cancer removed. My bill would provide Medicare coverage for all FDA-approved, blood-based tests for colorectal cancer screening and the treatment, if cancer is found. That way we can prevent what happened to my father from happening to other fathers nationwide.  SAFE Act of 2019: Making our elections safer and easier for voters  Nothing is more important to democracy than faith in the electoral system. This is why Russia is so desperate to hack and infiltrate our social media. They want to create distrust in our elections and our democracy.  I signed on to the SAFE Act to strengthen the security of our elections and the trust in our democracy. The Act will address election security concerns through grant programs and requirements for voting systems and paper ballots. Thanks to this act, the Election Assistance Commission will have several new responsibilities. It must award grants to states to replace certain voting systems, carry out voting system security improvements,&nbsp;find the best way to design a ballot, write instructions for how to use that ballot, and test the ease of use for future ballots. I believe these actions will make our elections safer and easier for voters.  Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2019: Denying airlines the right to overcharge passengers during a crisis  In September, I introduced the Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2019, legislation to prevent airplane ticket price gouging before and after disasters. Climate change has increased the number of natural disasters dramatically. When they hit, area residents have few options available to take shelter and find safety, particularly when they are stuck on an&nbsp;island. During the time of&nbsp;Hurricane Maria, major airlines&nbsp;significantly raised their ticket prices in Puerto Rico. Many citizens who tried to evacuate&nbsp;before or after that&nbsp;disaster were trapped because they couldn&#8217;t afford the outrageous costs. My bill would prevent such airline abuse in the future for all Americans.  Raise the Wage Act of 2019: Giving minimum wage workers the raise they deserve  We need to give our workers a raise to show our appreciation for&nbsp;the hard work and effort they&nbsp;put in every day.&nbsp; I co-sponsored this legislation because it would increase the federal minimum wage for regular employees over a seven-year period, tipped employees, and newly hired employees who are under the age of 20 years old.  The bill would increase the minimum wage every year for six years until it reached $15 per hour for regular employees.&nbsp; It would provide other increases for disabled employees as well as employees who receive tips as a substantial portion of their wages.&nbsp; A pay raise for these workers is long overdue.&nbsp; This legislation would give employees a living wage and increase economic opportunities in their communities.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Gateway Project Update: Pushing to rebuild bridges and tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey        Gateway construction area    In September, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing on federal grants for state infrastructure projects. The Gateway Program, which will replace decaying bridges and tunnels connecting New Jersey and New York, is the most critical infrastructure project in the country. The federal government promised to fund half of the total cost of the project and then began to backtrack on that promise.&nbsp; That agreement should be honored. During the hearing, I questioned the acting Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration on why they are holding up federal funding for the Portal North Bridge project when it is ready to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need this project funded and these improvements made immediately.  Constituent Correspondence: Responding to Constituent Concerns  The thousands of letters I receive from constituents are extremely important to me.&nbsp; During the time period from January 3 to September 30, 2019, I received 18,860 letters from constituents throughout the district about a variety of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Constituent Letters based on City of Origin&nbsp;   I appreciate your letters and your concerns about issues that affect our district.&nbsp; The most popular subjects were support for impeaching President Trump, support for the Dreamers and Promise Act, support for gun control regulation, support for the Climate Action Now Act, support for legislation to support the Green New Deal, support for the Equality Act, support for a ban on toxic pesticides, support for the Social Security Fairness Act, support for stronger rules against robocalls, and support for the Saving America's Pollinators Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;  In closing, it has been a busy time for legislative and district activities.&nbsp; These are but a few of the actions I&#8217;ve taken during the last few months to improve the health and prosperity of all my constituents. I hope you are having a great Fall and let me know how I can be of service in the future.  Sincerely, Donald M.

From continuing the appropriations process to introducing a bill that could help boost tourism in our state, there&#8217;s a lot to report! All of the details are here in my weekly newsletter, so keep scrolling for more information. And click here or the image below to watch my weekly video message. Be sure to forward this newsletter to a few friends to share the news!    Wild and Wonderful West Virginia  The New River Gorge is a special part of West Virginia and a real source of pride for our state. Whether it&#8217;s cheering on the BASE jumpers at Bridge Day, experiencing the thrill of world-class white water rafting, catching a glimpse into our state&#8217;s history and the unique geology of Appalachia, or taking in the beautiful panoramic views, the New River Gorge provides unlimited opportunities for thousands of visitors each year. Earlier this week, Senator Manchin and I introduced a bill that will help promote the beauty and historical significance of the New River Gorge by redesignating the National River to a National Park and Preserve. This redesignation will shine a new, brighter light on the New River Gorge and its many offerings&#151;including hunting and fishing&#151;to help drive tourism and spur the local and regional economy. Click here or the image below to learn more about this bill and what it means for our state.     Appropriations Update  This week, we continued working in the Appropriations Committee to consider several important government funding measures. A few days ago, the committee took action to provide resources that will keep our nation secure, our citizens safe, our economy thriving, and our environment protected. The bills we considered&#151;and ultimately passed out of committee were:   Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Interior and Environment Appropriations bill. State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill.  Not only were we able to pass all of these bills out of committee, but they include a lot of important funding for agencies and programs that have benefited our state and so many West Virginians&#151;from the Katherine Johnson IV&amp;V Center, NOAA in Fairmont, CJIS in Clarksburg, the Leetown Science Center or our three Coast Guard facilities in the Eastern Panhandle, to increased resources we dedicate to fighting opioids, monitoring PFAS contamination, improving cybersecurity, and securing our border. As a leader on this committee, I made sure that West Virginians&#8217; best interests were always front and center; and I was proud that all of these measures reflect that. Click here to learn more.    Nominating the Next Generation of Leaders  As a U.S. senator, I have the great privilege of nominating young West Virginians for entry into our military academies. This afternoon, I hosted my fourth and final Academy Day event of the fall. I hope many of you were able to attend one of these, but if not, you can still learn more about this terrific opportunity on my website. My nomination application is available online here and is due on October 15, 2019, so check out the nominations webpage to learn more and feel free to reach out to my office if you have any questions along the way. Grant Updates  Making sure our communities have the resources they need is important to improving the lives of West Virginians and building a brighter future for our state. Whether it&#8217;s providing funding for transportation infrastructure or delivering resources to support education programs, my position on the Senate Appropriations Committee has empowered me to secure funds for important West Virginia priorities. This week, I was proud to announce several grants that will help communities and programs across the state. Learn more about each one below:   $32,559,963 for affordable housing for low-income families. $6,145,690 for health services in West Virginia. $5,839,934 for economic investments across the state. $1,056,000 for job training programs in West Virginia.

Or maybe you do it the old-fashioned way with a pen and paper. Regardless of how you keep track of it, your to-do list says a lot about your priorities. After last week, it is crystal clear the only thing on Washington Democrats' to-do list is \"impeach President Donald Trump.\" *They've already spent countless time and at least $25 million in wasted tax dollars on the Mueller Report - which showed zero collusion. *They've already forced the House of Representatives to vote three separate times on impeachment - and each vote failed. They've already tried time and again to launch a partisan impeachment process in search of a crime, and last week was no different. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rushed to announce an \"impeachment inquiry\" based on unsubstantiated, anonymous and secondhand allegations. *This is unprecedented. *The White House released the transcript of the call in question and proved these rumors to be false - there was no quid pro quo and there were no laws broken on the call. *These partisan tactics and their one-item agenda won't improve your or your family's lives.* It's clear Congressional Democrats' hatred for our president far outweighs their desire to accomplish things in a bipartisan way. At the end of the day, you deserve better. There are countless items that should be on Congress's to-do list - like lowering drug prices, paying our troops, securing our border, improving our economy and updating our nation's infrastructure. The most frustrating thing about all this is we've made some great strides on important issues in spite of Washington Democrats' unwillingness to work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if bipartisanship was at the top of their to-do list! We've seen progress like a stronger economy and more opportunities for our nation's veterans.* According to data recently released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), our country's 19.2 million veterans have a jobless rate of just 3.5% - a near record-low. *Good policies like tax reform and smarter regulations have led to a strong and stable economy that empowers veterans with the skills needed to transition to civilian life and find good-paying jobs. *Another big factor is a law I helped champion called the Forever GI Bill. *This was the largest expansion of GI Bill benefits in a decade, and it was a bipartisan effort - both Republicans and Democrats worked together to get it done for our nation's heroes. We've also seen progress like lower-income workers seeing more opportunities with higher wages. According to recent reports, the percentage of lower-income workers in America who found new job opportunities nearly tripled. *This progress is being driven by the longest economic expansion on record, and our workers are benefitting tremendously.* Finally, we've seen progress like lower health premiums for seniors. It was announced last week that on average, Medicare Advantage premiums in 2020 are expected to decline 23% from 2018. *And on top of that, plan choices, benefits and enrollment continue to increase.* In fact, the Medicare Advantage average monthly premium will be the lowest in the last 13 years for millions of people. *While this is all incredible progress, can you imagine how much better it would be if Washington Democrats joined Republicans - put the partisan impeachment charade aside - and worked in a bipartisan way on our nation's actual priorities?* As I said to my colleagues at an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week, our constituents don't care which party had which idea, they just want solutions. *Working towards bipartisan solutions that benefit our community will always be at the top of my to-do list.* *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* [image = [link 1] [image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] [image = [link 6] [image = [link 7] [image = [link 8] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":4.980064},{"name":"Senator Lamar Alexander","address":"info@alexander.enews.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-09-28","subject":"Latest from Lamar: The whole world sings with Tennessee","body":"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk *Important news from this week:* - One of the most beautiful bridges in America, on one of the most beautiful drives in America, was named this week after Dean Stone - a good friend of mine and of the Great Smoky Mountains. The Dean Stone Bridge is located on the Foothills Parkway in the Smokies. - I introduced legislation that will make it easier for Tennessee students to attend college. This proposal includes legislation that simplifies the dreaded FAFSA - the student aid form that Governor Bill Haslam called \"the single largest impediment to more students participating in Tennessee Promise.\" - The United States Senate confirmed President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia. *The whole world sings with Tennessee* [image = [link 1] *Click here [link 2]or on the above image to listen to my remarks.* I spoke on the Senate floor about Ken Burns' new film series, \"Country Music,\" which concludes this week on PBS. The first two hours of 'Country Music' were about the recordings of hillbilly music in 1927 at the birthplace of country music in Bristol, where the Tennessee-Virginia state line runs down the middle of Main Street. The rest of the episodes wind through a community called Boogertown in the Smoky Mountains, where Dolly Parton was born, to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, to Beale Street in Memphis. As a senator from Tennessee, I must confess my bias, but Burns' new documentary shows that the whole world sings with Tennessee. If you haven't already, consider watching these great films and learn more about Tennessee's country music history. [image = I was at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville not long ago and heard Will Duvall play a song he wrote called, \"The King of Country Music.\" It was good to have him in Washington this week where I got to hear him play that song again, and talk about the Music Modernization Act [link 3] - bipartisan legislation I introduced and President Trump signed into law to ensure songwriters are paid fairly. *Visitors to the Foothills Parkway will know Dean Stone's legacy* [image = If you want to see the best view of the highest mountains in the eastern United States, you'll drive the Foothills Parkway. The scene is so magnificent that it surprises even those of us who have grown up admiring the Smokies. This parkway is also home to one of the most beautiful bridges in America, and, this week, it was named after a good friend of mine and of the Great Smoky Mountains - Dean Stone. For those who don't know Dean, he was the long time editor of *The Daily Times* in Maryville, and a lifetime advocate for the Great Smoky Mountains. Dean did as much as anybody to make the Foothills Parkway happen. He enthusiastically celebrated the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and was the best historian of what I like to call the \"Oak Ridge Corridor\" that we ever knew. As East Tennesseans know, we all love stories about ourselves, and Dean could tell them. It is now my hope that the naming of this bridge will tell the story of Dean Stone. [image = It was good to visit with some folks from Nissan this week. The auto industry has done more for our state the last forty years than anything else and has been the number one driver of higher family incomes. *Introducing legislation to make it easier for Tennesseans to attend college* This week, I introduced a long-term solution to permanently provide funding for Minority Serving Institutions, including the six Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Tennessee. This solution is part of a package of eight bipartisan higher education bills drafted by 35 senators - 20 Democrat, 15 Republican. This package of bills will make it easier for millions of students to get a college education by simplifying the Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) - which according to former governor, Bill Haslam, is \"the single biggest impediment to more students enrolling in Tennessee Promise.\" It would also provide Pell grants to parole-eligible prisoners, allow Pell grants to be used for short-term programs and increase the maximum Pell grant award. *Confirming Eugene Scalia to serve as U.S. Secretary of Labor* [image = This week, the Senate labor committee I chair approved the nomination of Eugene Scalia, President Trump's nominee to serve as Secretary of Labor. And Thursday, his nomination was confirmed by the full Senate. Mr. Scalia has the skills to help continue to grow our economy and help workers gain the skills they need to succeed in today's workplace. I am glad we have a well-qualified Secretary of Labor, so we can continue to create a strong economy for Tennesseans. *Read below about three of the five funding bills approved this week by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, and the impact they will have on Tennessee:* *Approving legislation that funds the border wall the right way* I support the president on border security, and I commend him for pursuing funding for the border wall in the right way - by asking the Congress for funding, allowing Congress to consider his request, and working with Congress to achieve a result. Congress has approved, for the last four presidents - Obama, Clinton, W. Bush and H.W. Bush - on a bipartisan basis, 654 miles of physical barrier - that's wall - along our almost 2,000 mile southern border. The bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee this week continues the work to secure our border by including $5 billion for the border wall system. When a president, elected by the people of the United States, has a legitimate objective, we in Congress should bend over backwards to try to meet that objective if we want a result, regardless of whatever you may think of him or her. This bill is now ready to be considered by the full United States Senate. *Approving more money to reduce the maintenance backlog at the Great Smoky Mountain**s **National Park* The Senate Appropriations Committee took a promising step to reduce the maintenance backlog at our national parks, including at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The funding approved this week will help restore the campgrounds, trails,and roads in what Ken Burns calls \"America's best idea\" - our national park system. The next step is to pass the Restore Our Parks Act [link 4], bipartisan legislation I introduced that would be the biggest help to our parks in a generation. Also included in this bill is money to help Tennessee protect its waterways from invasive Asian carp. Asian carp are aggressively invading Tennessee waterways and threaten biodiversity, the economy,and sporting from Memphis to Chattanooga. While the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency is working to combat Asian carp in the Tennessee-Cumberland Sub-basin, additional federal resources are needed. I was glad to support the $25 million in funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to combat this issue and protect commercial fishing and our nation's waters. *Approving funding to help Tennessee fight the opioid crisis* The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved a funding bill that provides $505 million for U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grants to help states, including Tennessee, tackle the opioid crisis. States could use these grants to help fund their drug courts, educational efforts, law enforcement programs, recovery programs, and treatment programs. Our law enforcement officers witness almost daily the tragedy associated with the opioid crisis, which effects virtually every American community. This funding will help give them the support they need to keep our communities safe. I was also glad to see that the $12 million I requested to fund meth lab cleanup was included in this bill. This will allow DOJ to continue to assist states in the very difficult and often dangerous efforts to clean up meth labs. According to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, between 2002 and 2012, Tennessee law enforcement agencies discovered more than 16,000 meth labs. While lab seizures are down, meth abuse continues to be a serious and deadly problem across Tennessee.

In Article I, Section 2, the Founders declared that the, &#8220;House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.&#8221;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the founders mandated that Congress protect and preserve the balance of powers before, designating congressional authority to oversee tax and trade, or to address the question of war and peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that Congress will forsake our other duties and responsibilities.&nbsp; Please find below some updates on appropriations, gun violence, the Year of Return, and global peace efforts which you may find of interest.  &nbsp;  Keep the faith,&nbsp;  /s  John Lewis  Member of Congress     &nbsp;Appropriations  The House and Senate adopted H.R. 4378, the continuing resolution (CR) to fund the Federal Government until November 21st.&nbsp; The text of the H.R. 4378 is available&nbsp;here, and a division-by-division summary of the legislation is available&nbsp;here.&nbsp; The CR passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 301 to 123 on September 19, 2019.&nbsp; The Senate adopted the bill by a bipartisan vote of 81 to 16 on September 26, 2019.&nbsp; It is expected to become public law in the next few days. &nbsp;This bill will prevent a government shutdown and give Congress more time to resolve outstanding funding issues in the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill.  Gun Violence  Similar to many people around the country, I was heartbroken by the waves of gun violence during the month of August.&nbsp;  On Wednesday, September 25, 2019, I accompanied gun violence survivors and those who lost their loved ones in requesting a meeting with the Senate Majority Leader on the necessity of considering H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and other common-sense House-passed bills to stem the plague of gun violence in our nation.  In the past two weeks, I chaired two congressional hearings to address gun violence that plagues our community:   The first hearing examined how the tax code subsidizes hate.&nbsp; We heard moving testimony from courageous witnesses that included Mr. Jeff Binkley, from Metro Atlanta.&nbsp; In 2018, his beautiful daughter Maura Binkley was killed by a misogynist who hated women. Earlier this week, I held another hearing which examined the health consequences and costs of gun violence.&nbsp; Dr. David Satcher, MD, PhD, former Surgeon General, Director of the Centers for Disease Control, and Founding Director and Senior Advisor of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute, Morehouse School of Medicine testified.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; During the bipartisan, public discussion Members seemed to agree on the importance of research and the overwhelming cost of gun violence to our health systems. &nbsp;The response to the moving witness testimony made me feel hopeful about the prospect for bipartisan, congressional solutions to reduce mass shootings and gun violence. &nbsp; 400 Years: The Year of Return     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, this year marks the 400th year anniversary of 400 years of African American History.&nbsp; In preparation for this moment in history, I was proud to cosponsor legislation to create the 400 Years of African American History Commission.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, I joined Rep. Bobby Scott (VA) in introducing a bill to extend the commission until 2022.&nbsp; We also continue to offer amendments to increase federal funding to support the Commission&#8217;s important work.&nbsp; I will continue to advocate for the highest level of funding for this important work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer I had the honor to travel to Ghana as part of a congressional delegation to commemorate the Year of Return to Ghana.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one of the most moving and emotional visits of my life and reminded me of how Ghana&#8217;s first President Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah and African liberation movements inspired our efforts to fight injustice here in the United States.  International Peace Day  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, the United Nations (UN) declared the opening day of the UN General Assembly, which falls on the third Tuesday of September, as the International Day of Peace.&nbsp; In 2001, the UN officially designated September 21st as the annual day of recognizing and supporting global peace design, building, and keeping initiatives.&nbsp; This year&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Climate Action for Peace.&#8221;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not too late for faith leaders, teachers, students, artists, and communities to participate in the global celebration for peace.&nbsp; Until October 2, 2019, participants may upload and record their participation in the United States Institute of Peace&#8217;s(USIP) #PeaceDayChallenge.&nbsp; If you are planning a visit to Washington, D.C., you may also set aside time to explore the Peace Trail on the National Mall.

As we all know, there was a community tragedy in Farmington this month when a building exploded, apparently from a propane leak. The building housed a program for people with developmental disabilities. One firefighter was killed and seven others were injured.&nbsp; One small positive was that the building was unoccupied at the time of the blast, or the death toll would have been much higher. What this scene symbolizes is how we come together in times of need. The trucks are parked at the entrance to Farmington where the explosion took place, but if you look carefully you can see that each comes from a different neighboring town&#151;Jay on the right and Wilton on the left.&nbsp; People in Washington often ask me what&#8217;s so special about Maine, and I always have a one-word answer&#151;community. In many ways, Maine has the feel of a big small town (with very long streets) where people still know and care about one another, like in Farmington this week&#151;where a brave group of first responders put their lives on the line for the rest of us. Public Actions, not Private Assurances, Will Help Repair US-Saudi relations  &nbsp;  Trip to the Middle East with Senator Todd Young: At the beginning of September, Senator Todd Young and I traveled to Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, we met with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During our conversation with the Crown Prince, we made it clear that public actions &#150; not private assurances &#150; will repair the US/Saudi relationship.&nbsp; Saudi Arabia is a key counterweight to Iran, and as recent attacks on Saudi oil fields show, instability in the region ripples out to potentially disturb global peace and endanger American lives. Saudi Arabia is a valued security partner &#150; but not one we will support at any cost. Our visit showed positive advancements, but if the Crown Prince truly wishes to modernize his nation, there are a number of issues &#150; from women&#8217;s rights to the Kingdom&#8217;s conduct in Yemen to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi &#150; that must be addressed quickly and completely.   Senator King aboard the USS Gonzalez (built at Bath Iron Works)  Senator Young and I wrote an op-ed as a reflection of our trip to the Middle East. You may have first read it when it&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp; Defense News.  On Lobster Day, Celebrating our Industry and Addressing the Threats   I wrote the following op-ed celebrating National Lobster Day. It appeared in the Ellsworth American.&nbsp;  This week, we celebrate one of Maine&#8217;s most famous residents &#151; and no, I&#8217;m not talking about Stephen King or the couple who say &#8220;buttery flaky crust&#8221; in the Dysart&#8217;s commercial. Actually, this week marks National Lobster Day, when we celebrate not only our favorite crustacean, but all the men and women who help this industry and our state thrive.  Folks from away might not understand why we are celebrating the lobster, but Maine people know that this shellfish isn&#8217;t just a delicious meal &#151; it&#8217;s a vital part of our state&#8217;s economy, supporting communities up and down our coast. Maine people also know that even as we celebrate lobsters, this industry is facing serious challenges &#151; from well-intentioned but harmful potential regulations, to poorly designed foreign policy emanating from Washington, to the looming threat of warming waters due to climate change. So today, more than any other time in the past, it&#8217;s important to emphasize the value of this economic driver, and push back on the threats it faces.  One of the most pressing concerns facing our lobster industry is the danger of potentially misguided federal regulations to protect right whales. Now, let&#8217;s be clear: everyone, including lobstermen, wants to protect this endangered species. We just want to make sure we&#8217;re making changes based on sound data; and at this point, it is not clear that Maine&#8217;s lobster fishery is a significant contributor to right whale deaths. The possible changes threaten livelihoods and lives by calling for expensive and dangerous new equipment configurations. Even worse, these changes would disproportionately affect Maine lobstermen while not holding Canadian fisheries to the same standards.  I&#8217;ve been pushing hard with my Maine colleagues, asking everyone from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to the President himself to make sure we&#8217;re not moving forward based on incomplete data. I even made the argument directly to NOAA officials at an Ellsworth scoping session last month, where more than a hundred concerned people packed into the high school auditorium on a beautiful Tuesday night. The message from the community was unified: we&#8217;re prepared to make reasonable changes to protect this species, but show us the data.  These potential regulations are a serious problem on the horizon, but there is an existing Washington policy that is already harming our industry &#151; the President&#8217;s trade war. China was the fastest growing market for Maine lobsters, and lobster dealers spent a lot of time and money building relationships with Chinese buyers. But that all changed when the trade war started. Lobsters were one of the first products targeted by China for retaliation after the President started imposing his tariffs, and this has had a severe impact: through the first six months of this year, American lobster exports to China declined by more than 80 percent, and Canadian businesses have already seized the opportunity.  Maine people are paying the price for this reckless trade war. The drop in exports is costing jobs and undermining our state&#8217;s ability to build relationships in the Chinese market. Despite this pain, the administration refuses to compensate our industry while it provides bailouts for soybean farmers in Iowa. This is wrong &#151; Maine people did not start this trade war. They deserve to be made whole.  Of course, neither of these concerns will matter if there are no lobsters to catch. That is the threat posed by the warming of waters due to climate change. The Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming portion of the world&#8217;s oceans, a fact that will dramatically alter ecosystems and drive lobster populations farther north. We&#8217;ve already seen once-stable lobster fisheries in Rhode Island and Massachusetts collapse; we don&#8217;t want Maine to be next. I&#8217;m working hard in the Senate to address climate change, through everything from energy efficiency to renewable energies. It&#8217;s the right thing to do for our planet and for our economy.  The men and women who drive our lobster industry make vital contributions to Maine. They&#8217;re our lobstermen and lobster processors and dealers, who pull the lobsters out of the water and ship them across the state, country, and world; they work in our tourism industry that is boosted by this world-renowned fishery, and in our restaurants that serve unparalleled products fresh from the sea; they are our neighbors and our friends. When we celebrate National Lobster Day, what we&#8217;re really celebrating are our people and communities who help make Maine so special.  So, to all of you who make this vital sector of Maine go: thank you. Our state wouldn&#8217;t be the same without you, and I&#8217;ll keep working to defend your livelihoods, in ways both big and small (think emoji-sized), from anyone and anything that interferes with your work. Scenes from Maine &amp; D.C    This past Wednesday, September 25, was National Lobster Day &#150; a day to celebrate not only Maine&#8217;s most iconic industry, but also all the important people who work this fishery each and every day. During our Wednesday morning Capitol Coffee, we offered a traditional Maine lobster egg bake (along with our usual blueberry bread and Maine coffee!). &nbsp;  Later in the day, I was proud to honor the new home for the Maine Lobsterman statue in Washington, fittingly located right off Maine Avenue SW.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; I shared a great morning at the New England Council in Southern Maine, where we discussed some of my work with local leaders and heard about what they believe are the most pressing issues facing our state. It is a privilege to represent Maine people in the Senate, and I take my responsibility to speak on their behalf in Washington seriously. &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Climate change is one of my top priorities, and energy efficiency is an often overlooked but major tool to cut emissions; the cleanest (and cheapest!) kilowatt is the one we don&#8217;t use. This month, I spoke at the&nbsp;Alliance To Save Energy's event about how we can work together towards a cleaner future.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Legislative Update  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Worked to make the Annotated Constitution available to all Americans.&nbsp;To commemorate National Constitution Day, I sent a letter to the Library of Congress, urging to make the Constitution Annotated easily available to all Americans. The Constitution Annotated is compiled by the Library of Congress and details how the Supreme Court has interpreted each provision of the Constitution.&nbsp;Read more HERE. Advocated for family businesses in the logging industry. The Maine delegation&nbsp;led a bipartisan group of 16 members of Congress calling on the Department of Labor (DOL) to take action. Specifically, weurged DOL to grant a regulatory exemption that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to learn the logging trade under parental supervision.&nbsp;Read more HERE. Named to the 2019 NDAA Conference Committee to advocate for Maine and National priorities. I was&nbsp;appointed as a conferee to the House of Representatives and Senate conference committee charged with reconciling differences between the two chambers&#8217; competing versions of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Good News For Maine   $2 million for Gulf of Maine Lobster research&nbsp;This investment will&nbsp;support a range of research projects to advance our understanding of the American lobster as well as to support a regional lobster extension program. The projects being funded will address the following priorities: increased understanding of life history parameters, including migration, growth, and maturity; larval studies and early biology; spatial distribution; and socio-economic lessons learned from Southern New England as they pertain to Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine.&nbsp;&nbsp; $2 million to revitalize Maine's forest products industry. The Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) has awarded $2,004,673 to East Millinocket Industrials, Maine Development Foundation, and Northern Forest Center. $500,000 for rural economic development.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Economic Development Administration (EDA), a bureau within the U.S. Department of Commerce, has awarded $446,757 in federal funding to the Maine Development Foundation (MDF) to support and assist the economic efforts of rural Maine communities who have been negatively affected by mill closures.&nbsp;  In the News   Maine Public (Gratz) Angus King: Donald Trump Should 'Take A Deep Breath' Before Blaming Iran For Saudi Attack Reuters (Zengerle) Activists push U.S. Congress to pass Hong Kong bill CNN (Liptak) Trump's struggle with Iran policy continues without Bolton replacement The Hill (Kheel) Senators grill Army, Air Force nominees on military funding for border wall  Thanks for subscribing to my monthly newsletter!

I was so glad to hear about your favorite parks in New Mexico last month and I hope you have the opportunity to visit them this weekend. As New Mexicans, we know how important our state&#8217;s natural beauty and resources are to our way of life. National parks provide an economic boost to our communities, with more than 100 million dollars of economic output and over 1,000 jobs in New Mexico alone. Hiking, camping, and our historic sacred sites are part of who we are as New Mexicans, and hundreds of thousands of people come to our national parks every year to experience our culture.  The League of Conservation Voters gave me the honor of recognizing my work protecting our public lands in my role as the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to protect public lands in Alaska from destructive drilling. Recently, I held hearings on the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act to protect Chaco Canyon here in New Mexico. I will continue to fight and care for our public lands so future generations can enjoy them as we do now.

In 2015, more than six-hundred seventy thousand children spent time in our foster care system. One out of every twenty-five families with children have an adoptive child. Families adopt for a number of reasons, but whatever the reason, it is a beautiful and selfless decision.  Joining the U.S. House of Representatives has its rewards&#151;one of them being the people I come across that I normally wouldn&#8217;t outside of this job. This year, I had the privilege of nominating Kevin and Megan Kinney for the Angels in Adoption Award. Kevin serves as a Highway Patrolman and Megan is an accomplished author and stay at home mother. After they had their oldest daughter Emma, they felt called by God to participate in South Dakota&#8217;s foster care program. Soon after joining the foster care system, they brought three sisters&#151;Angel, Alicia, and Kylee&#151;into their home. All of the girls were under the age of three when Kevin and Megan became their foster parents. The Kinney&#8217;s instantly fell in love with their new additions and decided to take the big step and adopt them, making Angel, Alicia, and Kylee permanent members of the Kinney clan. Even though the Kinney&#8217;s knew it would be an adventure to adopt all three young children, they understood the importance of not separating the bond of sisterhood. Every child deserves to be a part of a family that loves and supports them. Stories like these hit close to home for me and my staff. In preparing this week&#8217;s column, I asked one of my staffers, who is adopted, for input. He was born to an 18-year-old girl out of wedlock. Unable to afford a child at the time, she decided to put him up for adoption. He was adopted by a great family that lives just down the road from me in Mitchell. He is forever grateful for his parents&#8217; leap of faith and for his birthmother in allowing him to experience the full life he is living today. Adoption creates a ripple effect of love. It&#8217;s an antidote to agonizing, painful situations. My staffer described it as the gift of life.&nbsp;  The Kinney&#8217;s are more than deserving of the Angels in Adoption Award. Folks ranging from Muhammad Ali to First Lady Laura Bush have been recipients of this award. I&#8217;m proud to partner with an organization like Angels in Adoption which celebrates families, individuals, and organizations across the country that have made a remarkable contribution to children in need of families. Please join me in thanking the Kinney&#8217;s, and the rest of our adoptive and foster families in South Dakota, for stepping up when children need them the most.&nbsp;          &nbsp;          Washington, DC 1508 Longworth HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-2801    Aberdeen Office 304 6th Avenue SEAberdeen,&nbsp;SD&nbsp;57401Phone: (605) 622-1060&nbsp;  Rapid City Office 2525 W Main StreetSuite 310Rapid City,&nbsp;SD&nbsp;57702Phone: (605) 646-6454&nbsp;   Sioux Falls Office 300 North Dakota AvenueSuite 314Sioux Falls,&nbsp;SD&nbsp;57104Phone: (605) 275-2868&nbsp;       Please do not reply to this email; this address is not monitored.
