[{"name":"Congresswoman Carol Miller","address":"Rep.Carol.Miller@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-16","subject":"Protecting the Right to Life","body":"Congressman Carol Miller ?      Dear Friend, Happy Presidents' Day weekend! On this day we honor all that our Presidents have done to lead our nation into the prosperous and powerful one it is today. This week was filled with many exciting developments. I introduced legislation to fill the remaining gaps in the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act, that ensures all federal employees are guaranteed 12 weeks paid family leave after the birth, fostering, or adoption of a child. It is important we provide working families with resources to care for their young children, in order to achieve a fulfilling work-life balance in our modern economy.? Additionally, I offered an amendment in the Oversight and Reform Committee while discussing DC Statehood. The amendment would ensure all children born alive after an abortion attempt are granted the full right to life just as any other child would have. The Constitution guarantees the right to life for all citizens and we must do everything we can to stand up for our most innocent and smallest ones. Unfortunately, this amendment failed along party lines. Watch my full testimony by clicking the picture below.  ? The House also voted on the Equal Rights Amendment this week. Ispoke  in opposition of this legislation because it would create the basis for taxpayer funded abortion at the federal level, would force healthcare providers to perform abortions, and would permanently allow abortions up until the moment of birth for any reason. This attack on life is tragic.? As always, do not hesitate to reach out to any of my offices in Washington, Huntington, Beckley, and Bluefield. I am here to help you and greatly value your input. Sincerely, Carol Miller Member of Congress Issue of the Week: Encouraging Our Girls to Join STEM Wednesday was Girl Day on the Hill! I joined with DiscoverE and Collins Aerospace to encourage young girls to explore a STEM career. Did you know that 50% of the workforce is women, but only 28% of the STEM workforce is women? We need to change that. If we provide an environment that gives girls the confidence and assurance they need to choose a STEM career, we can close this gender gap within our next generation. ?

The budget proposal is pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth and pro-American. The President's budget also includes great news for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP). The budget includes full funding to keep the project on track. This is the fourth year in a row SHEP will receive full federal funding from the Trump Administration, pending Congressional passage of the annual appropriations bill. President Trump has again proven that the Trump administration understands the critical importance of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project for our nation. The project is now well past the half way mark. While the finish line is finally in sight, I will continue to fight tirelessly for this federal support and to ensure the project is completed. Also this week, I announced that we secured a federal Department of Transportation grant of $34,600,000.00 for the Port of Savannah. The Port Infrastructure Development Grant is critical to straighten and realign Berth 1, one of the oldest areas of the Port, to increase efficiency. The funding will work to modernize the Berths to handle larger ships. This grant is necessary to ensure the Port is able to handle additional cargo. This announcement goes hand-in-hand with recent news, including the recent land acquisition, to increase port capacity and efficiency. I am excited that this federal funding will work to modernize the port, allow larger ships and increase the amount of cargo they will be able to move. I discussed President Trump's budget and the blockbuster week for the Port of Savannah in this week's edition of Buddy's Briefing. Click here to watch Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCLIII Monday, February 10, 2020: After an early morning flight back to Washington, Im in the House Chamber where I pay tribute to one of my favorite veterans, Paul Grassey from Savannah. Paul, a World War II veteran who is also a great singer and routinely leads us in patriotic songs at veterans events, has recently been given the French governments highest possible honor, the Legion of Honor, for his military service and role in helping to free France from Nazi occupation. A link to my tribute can be found here. Once back in my office, we have our weekly all district conference call to discuss last weeks events in the district, upcoming events and casework. Later, I have a series of phone interviews to discuss President Trumps fiscal year 2021 budget proposal that was released today and includes full funding for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) for the fourth straight year. Funding this project was one of my top priorities when I took office five years ago and this good news should allow us to complete dredging by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. My first interview is with WTOC TV in Savannah, followed by the Savannah Morning News (SMN) and WJCL TV in Savannah. A link to these stories can be found here, here and here.

Once back in my office, I have a phone interview with WSAV TV in Savannah to discuss SHEP funding. A link to this interview can be found here. The good news on the Port of Savannah keeps coming as we find out today that we have secured a $34.6 million Department of Transportation (DOT) grant that will allow us to straighten and realign one of the oldest parts of the Port to accommodate larger ships. Before heading to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day, I have a phone interview with the SMN to discuss the grant. A link to the story can be found here. After votes, I remain in the House Chamber where I memorialize Ann Cox Chambers who recently passed. A link to my tribute can be found here. Rep. Carter meeting with a delegation from the Federal Bureau of Prisons Once back in my office, I have a meeting with the Georgia Special Olympics delegation followed by a meeting with the Director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Scientists (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Next, I meet with a delegation from the Federal Bureau of Prisons before having an on-camera interview with WTOC TV in Savannah to discuss the DOT grant for the Port of Savannah. A link to my interview can be found here. Wednesday, February 12, 2020: Im up early this morning and head to downtown Washington with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as we meet with CEOs of pharmaceutical manufacturers to discuss the prescription drug pricing bills being considered in Congress. Once back at the Capitol, I head to a GOP policy conference where we discuss the threats posed by China and hear from experts in the field. Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to Clermont Huger Lee and Suzanne Shank who are being honored by the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) as Women of Vision, Dr. Freddie Smith, who has retired as the Senior Pastor at Sweat Memorial Baptist Church in Waycross, and the Savannah Art Association on celebrating their 100th anniversary.

Rob Woodall (R-GA), a member of the Budget and Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committees. Before calling it a day, I head to the T&I Committee room where I film this weeks edition of Buddys Briefings. Thursday, February 13, 2020: Having owned my own business for over 30 years, Ive had many associates come and go. While youre always glad to see someone better themselves, many are difficult to replace. After an early morning meeting with leadership to discuss election issues, I spend the next few hours in my office interviewing candidates for our health care legislative assistant position. Fortunately, because I serve on the E&C Healthcare Subcommittee, top candidates are attracted to our office and we have quality interviews. After filming a quick video to promote our open house next Wednesday, February 19th, at our new Brunswick district office location, I head to the House Chamber for our only vote series of the day before heading to the airport for my return trip home. Friday, February 14, 2020: After getting a few hours of sleep last night, Im up early for my Band of Brothers bible study in Garden City this morning and afterwards head down to St. Simons Island where I have the pleasure of visiting St. Simons Christian School.  Rep. Carter visiting St. Simons Christian School Ive always said that interacting with students is my favorite part of serving in this position and today is another example why. What a great group of students! Because it is a small school, I get to visit each classroom from pre-K through 5th and then meet with the 6th through 8th grade classes as a group. They ask great questions and I thoroughly enjoy my visit. Afterwards, I head to Sea Island where my good friend, Jonathan RacIin, has assembled an outstanding group of community leaders for a round table discussion on national and world issues. Next, I head back to Savannah and during the drive I have a phone interview with WJAX TV in Jacksonville for an update on the Golden Ray removal project in the Brunswick Harbor.  Rep.

The two 2020 honorees, Clermont Huger Lee and Suzanne Shank, join an elite group of trailblazers whose remarkable ideas, insightful leadership and distinguished service have had a major impact on the City of Savannah. My last stop of yet another busy week is to Tybee Island where the Two Hundred Club of the Coastal Empire is hosting a benefit. This great organization helps provide for the surviving spouses and dependents of law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics who lose their lives in the line of duty.

In my remarks, I urged us all to remember President Lincoln's insightful words, \"A house divided against itself, cannot stand.\" I look forward to continuing to work together in unity with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to benefit all Americans.  Continue reading for a brief update on my work on your behalf last week.  Advocating for our Heroes  It was a pleasure to meet with Dr. Miguel LaPuz, VA VISN 8 Director. We discussed issues impacting local Veterans, and current plans to expand the Zephyrhills Clinic and North Pinellas VA clinics. I appreciate his commitment to ensure Veterans receive the care they deserve and look forward to continuing to work with him on critical improvements to the system.   In last week&#8217;s VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Hearing we discussed a variety of draft bills to help improve educational opportunities for Veterans. This included my legislation to modernize GI Bill certificate of eligibility processing, as well as bills I support that would improve the STEM education and VET-TECH programs. Click here to listen to my remarks during the hearing. Additionally, I was glad to see this bill I supported signed into law last week. It will help Veterans develop the skills and educational acumen to attain lucrative jobs in STEM industries. Protecting Patients  Last week, I was proud to become the newest member of the Congressional ALS Caucus. ALS a debilitating and horrific disease that claims the life of many Americans far too soon. Additionally, a disproportionate number of Veterans have been diagnosed with ALS, which is alarming. I have long been a supporter of legislation and federal funding designed to increase research that will lead to better treatments and cures for rare diseases, like ALS. However, as an active member of the ALS Caucus, I will be able to do even more. I join this caucus in honor of Doug, who is a constituent, a Veteran and a friend of mine. Doug has bravely battled ALS for almost 15 years. I am inspired by Doug&#8217;s courage, his family&#8217;s commitment and by his best friend, Gary, who has become a fierce and vocal advocate for all ALS patients who struggle with this disease. Together, I am optimistic that our Caucus can be a catalyst for change and that we will do what it takes to find a cure.   It was great to meet with local leaders from Advent Health Hospitals last week. They were in town to discuss how we can improve transparency in healthcare costs and protect patients from surprise medical bills.&nbsp; Surprise medical billing typically occurs when a patient receives an unexpected bill after a medical procedure due to items that were not covered by his/her insurance.&nbsp; As I promised the leaders from Advent Health, I will continue to work on fixing this problem.   Additionally, in last week&#8217;s Health Subcommittee hearing, I appreciated the chance to share stories from women in my district who feel strongly about the need to protect the sanctity of life. Click here to listen to me share their words.  Learning from You  I had the distinct pleasure of meeting with Florida athletes from this year&#8217;s Special Olympics and listen to their inspirational stories. This wonderful program promotes inclusion, celebrates diversity and encourages us all to reach our highest potential.   I also had the opportunity to meet with visually impaired and blind constituents who are members of the National Federation for the Blind. We discussed accommodations and assistive technologies that can be utilized to ensure those with disabilities are fully able to participate in society. As someone with significant visual impairments myself, I am grateful for their work and continued advocacy. I will continue to support their efforts.   One of my favorite parts of the job is having the opportunity to meet with young people and listen to their ideas about how to improve our nation. Last week, I was fortunate to meet with students from Sunlake High School in Land O' Lakes. They were in D.C. as part of the Junior State of America program. I found them to be bright, insightful and optimistic about the future.   I was honored to meet with a constituent from Palm Harbor, Mr. Joe Hedger, who owns a local small business. We discussed the need to invest in sustainable infrastructure projects throughout the nation, and the need for national standards on composites and other new manufacturing technology.   Additionally, I will be hosting a teletown hall this Wednesday, February 19, 2020 at 6:00 p.m. This forum allows a maximum number of constituents to participate. On average, several thousand constituents join in each teletown hall for the entire hour-long exchange. This is just one of the multiple ways that I communicate with my constituents on a regular basis. I look forward to the opportunity to provide a brief update of what I have been working on in Washington and answering your questions. The system will be randomly dialing constituents; however, if you want to ensure your participation you can call in directly at 1-888-480-3641.  Ensuring Public Safety  In last week&#8217;s Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee we discussed proposed legislation to encourage innovation and safety in the regulation of autonomous vehicles. We want to benefit from the major advances this technology will offer while ensuring that the public is protected. I am grateful that legislation I authored is currently being negotiated into the bipartisan package. My bill would ensure that seniors and those with disabilities are considered when developing regulations for this new technology. Strengthening Strategic Alliances  Andy Athens and Maynard Wishner led efforts by Greek- American and American-Jewish communities to strengthen ties between Greece and Israel. Each year an Athens-Wishner award is given to an individual for showing leadership on Eastern Mediterranean issues and for bolstering the relationship between the Jewish and Hellenic diasporas. I was proud to receive this prestigious honor last week.   Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent.  &#8220;Congressman Bilirakis has a caring and efficient staff who are concerned about and serve their constituents. I greatly appreciate all that you have done to help me with the Department of Veteran&#8217;s Affairs. It took only a few days (instead of up to 6 weeks) for the VA to acknowledge my Medicare. Thank you for supporting disabled service connected veterans and their spouses.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  While I'm away in Washington, I have a team of am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team was happy to join the Dade City Chamber of Commerce and help celebrate the ribbon cutting for ACE Hardware Store.   My team enjoyed the unveiling of 40 new exhibits at the West Pasco Historical Society, Dr. Rao Musunuru Library. It is wonderful to see a celebration of our community's rich cultural heritage and a desire to preserve the past.   During last week's Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce meeting, my team enjoyed learning about the importance of preventative eye care and screenings from Dr. Grace Levy-Clarke from the University of South Florida.  My team enjoyed meeting with U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia during his visit to Tampa last week. He discussed the strength of our economy and plans to increase apprenticeship programs throughout the nation.      Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update.

This week, President Trump released a responsible budget for Fiscal Year 2021, a budget that will lower our deficit by $4.6 trillion by 2030. I think the President is right to begin the conversation about tackling our debt and deficits. Our country has a spending problem, and the solutions will require bold leadership. Last year, U.S. revenue was at an all-time high, but spending increased even faster. We have a national debt over $23 trillion and it continues growing. Americans across the country balance their household budget every month, and its up to Congress to do the same for the government once again. In order to get our fiscal house in order, we must make sound investments and ensure every taxpayer dollar is spent wisely. President Trumps FY 21 budget seeks responsible reforms to our mandatory programs which are driving our spending growth. For instance, the President is proposing reforms to Medicaid that will empower states to innovate with their programs and save the government money. Tennessee, for instance, is chomping at the bit to put in place innovative reforms that will ensure patient access to care. I also think another positive reform the Trump administration is proposing is to require SNAP recipients to pursue work. Programs like SNAP are a critical lifeline, but they can also help encourage able-bodied, healthy adults to contribute to society and give them a hand up, not a handout. In contrast, Democrats continue to work to further expand Medicaid to cover illegal aliens and refuse to consider reasonable work requirements. I am also encouraged the president proposed tackling the crisis at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Multiemployer pensions are in a dire fiscal crisis, and the retirement of millions of Americans is threatened if action is not taken. The president is right to encourage action on this critical matter, and I look forward to working closely with his administration to get this done in a way that is fair to retirees and to taxpayers. Im also pleased to see the president investing in some of our countrys most critical priorities. As ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, his request of $240 billion for veterans programs through the Department of Veterans Affairs is truly cause for celebration. Year after year, President Trump has requested record levels of funding for our veterans  and he has delivered on those promises. This budget represents a quintupling of VAs bottom line over the last twenty years. There is no question the Department is in the midst of a critical transformation with respect to the delivery of healthcare and benefits to those who have served. With this budget request, VA will be more prepared than ever before to ensure those efforts bear fruit for generations of veterans to come. President Trump again showed his unwavering support to our men and women in uniform in the FY21 budget. It places Armed Forces readiness as a top priority, and I couldnt be more supportive. During the Obama administration, our military was vastly underfunded and underprepared. The FY21 budget requests $718 billion  a five-percent increase from FY 20  to fund our Department of Defense. This funding will go toward updating equipment; helping with recruitment; and improving the training of troops. With instability in the Middle East, its critical we ensure our nation is prepared. The administration requested $51.7 billion for the Department of Homeland Security to help protect our borders with new border security equipment and technology; the recruitment of new Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers; and, specifically, $5 billion for construction of new border wall. The president is also continuing to invest in programs aimed at fighting the opioid epidemic, which is critical to East Tennessee. While national opioid-related deaths in 2018 decreased nationwide, Tennessee saw an increase. Its important we help fund federal, state and local programs to treat and prevent addiction. Thankfully, this administration prioritized ending this epidemic and requested $5 billion for these initiatives. The House Democrat majority failed to release a budget last year, and were waiting to see whether they will even attempt to this year. Im glad we have a president like Donald Trump who wants to set ceilings  not floors  on federal spending. I look forward to having a debate about critical priorities and will work throughout this year to reduce the size of government. My door is always open to East Tennesseans and I encourage constituents to continue reaching out to my office to share their views on this important issue with me. Feel free to contact my office if I can be of assistance to you or your family.

Congress has been stuck at a standstill for too long. Having been sworn into Congress only a week prior to the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, I am thankful this storm has passed and I can finally begin the legislative work eastern North Carolinians elected me to do. Congress could and should have been working on issues like healthcare, prescription drugs, border security and more instead of this tiresome and illegitimate impeachment. Hopefully, we can finally get back to tending to the business of the people. Unfortunately, I doubt that will be the case after the petty and partisan theatrics displayed by Speaker Pelosi at the State of the Union address. Bipartisan efforts that would benefit the American people will likely be forgone due to the Speakers disdain for the president and her fear of giving him legislative victories. America deserves better. What's going on with coronavirus? As a physician and member of Congress, I wanted to give you all an update on the status of the coronavirus and how the United States is working to combat its spread. Watch the video below to learn more. Surprise billing There is bipartisan agreement that surprise billing is a major problem for patients and families across America. It desperately needs to be addressed. While Im glad we discussed the best path forward to alleviate the problems of surprise billing during a markup of H.R. 5800 in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week, this legislation is not the right solution to this problem. Even though I couldn't support H.R. 5800 in its entirety, I was glad to improve it with two amendments that were adopted unanimously. As a physician, I'll continue to utilize my expertise on these issues to lower the cost of healthcare and increase patient access to provide Americans with the greatest treatments possible. Watch my opening statement below: Veterans HOPE Act Last week, I was proud to introduce the Veterans HOPE Act to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans. Between 2010 and 2016, deaths due to opioid overdose rose by 65% among veterans. During those same years, veteran deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by roughly five-fold. Meanwhile, the rate of prescription opioid receipts within three months before death declined by more than 25%, suggesting that opioid overdoses are likely stemming from hard or synthetic drugs, without knowledge of the initial prescriber. To combat this issue, the Veterans HOPE Act would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to further investigate deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids. Upon conclusion of the study, the Secretary would report findings to the public and Congress and suggest veteran overdose prevention efforts to save lives. As a member of the North Carolina State Assembly, authoring the main legislative actions to combat the opioid crisis in North Carolina was one of my proudest achievements. Now as the U.S. Representative of a Congressional District with the fifth most veterans in America, the Veterans HOPE Act is especially important research to me. The data speaks for itselfveteran deaths caused by non-prescribed opioids like heroin and fentanyl have skyrocketed. But our veterans are more than a statistic. They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers who have selflessly sacrificed so much for our great nation. It is our duty to do all we can to protect them from the dangers of opioid addiction. You can read the bill here. District Highlights George Henry White Commemorative Stamp Act Honored to introduce legislation this week alongside several of my North Carolina colleagues to honor George Henry White of New Bern, a Republican politican and the last black member of Congress during Reconstruction. George Henry White courageously stood up to racial injustice in a hostile time period for African Americans, especially in the South. The cause of Civil Rights in this country was only advanced because of strong and brave leaders like him. It was only fitting that we honor such a historic African American figure during Black History Month. You can read more about his life and legacy here. Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office Almost one year after Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.'s passing, Im pleased that a bill I introduced in his honor advanced through the House of Representatives. This measure would designate a post office in his hometown of Farmville, the \"Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office.\" It was altogether fitting that my first piece of legislation as a member of Congress be a tribute to my predecessor, friend and mentor. Walter cared deeply for the people of eastern North Carolina, especially the Marines who serve at Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point and New River. He epitomized what a public servant stood forhis constituents. I greatly appreciate my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation for unanimously supporting this bill, and I hope the Senate and President Trump will swiftly act to make this bill a law. You can watch my remarks from the House floor in support of the bill below: Christina Koch Returns to Earth Congratulations to Christina Koch for completing her 328 day mission in space! Welcome back to planet Earth! Christina grew up in Jacksonville and attended NC State. Her time aboard the International Space Station set the record for the longest single continuous spaceflight by a female. Such a tremendous accomplishment for North Carolina, the United States of America and all of humanity. Welcome home, Christina! You can read more about her record-breaking flight here. District Work Even though I've been in our nation's capital for the past two weeks, I've met with numerous people and organizations from North Carolina, many of whom are from the Third District. Scroll through the photos below to see some of the people I met. Had a productive discussion about how Congress can impact state and local narcotic issues with Sgt. Kevin Black, Lt. Daniel Duckworth, Sgt. Mike Dawson, Special Agent Joe Barringer and Sgt. Jason Chappell. Enjoyed talking with representatives from the Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource Council. Forestry is such a vital part of the economy in eastern North Carolina. These gentlemen work at International Paper's facility in New Bern. I learned a great deal about this wonderful renewable resource. It was an honor meeting UNC Chapel Hill's Athletic Director, Bubba Cunningham, and other senior athletic department officials. We talked about college athletics and issues relating to student-athlete compensation that are affecting the NCAA. Met with Tom Gentile, President and CEO of Spirit AeroSystems to discuss their business and presence in North Carolina. Such an honor to attend the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit with President Trump and several of my colleagues from the North Carolina Congressional delegation. Cutting taxes and red tape has helped create jobs and raise wages across every demographic. We have helped stressed areas of our country by raising people out of poverty with jobs and pride. So much better than creating more government dependency. I will continue to support this administration and its pro-growth policies while serving the great people of eastern North Carolina. It was great meeting with Winston Salem Special Olympics athlete, Jennifer Wardlow, and President and CEO of Special Olympics North Carolina, Keith Fishburne. The Special Olympics is a truly fantastic organization. Honored to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, with several of my colleagues from the North Carolina delegation. Agriculture is extremely important in eastern North Carolina, and recent trade victories like USMCA and the Phase One trade agreement with China are big wins for American farmers. As a physician, I always enjoy discussing how we can improve America's healthcare system. Had a productive discussion with representatives from National Rural Health. Access, equity and quality of healthcare are especially important issues in places like eastern North Carolina. Thanks for reading! Thank you for signing up to receive my newsletter.

The resolution passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Today marks two years since the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t think about the 17 lives we lost far too soon, and I&#8217;m proud to introduce this resolution honoring them with Senator Rubio. Over the past two years, I&#8217;ve worked closely with the families of the victims to make our schools safer and prevent future tragedies. We passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act while I was Governor and now I&#8217;m fighting for improvements on the federal level, including the Luke and Alex School Safety Act. While our hearts are still heavy with loss we cannot undo, we must do everything in our power to honor the memory of the victims and ensure no family has to go through this pain again.&#8221; &#151;  Also this week, Senator Rick Scott introduced:   A resolution applauding the University of West Florida Argonauts football team for its National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II national championship victory; Legislation to close a loophole that has allowed U.S. technology companies to sell products to Huawei, which the&nbsp;U.S. Government has determined to be a national security threat;&nbsp; The Taiwan SOS Act, which would allow diplomats and service members in the Taiwanese military to display their flag and wear their uniforms while in the U.S. on official businesses; and The Medical License Verification Act to prevent fraud in the healthcare system.  See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.              Sen. Rick Scott Applauds President Trump&#8217;s Commitment to Protecting Everglades  Senator Rick Scott applauded President Trump for including $250 million for Everglades Restoration in his Fiscal Year 2021 budget requests to Congress. This follows the letter Senator Scott and Senator Rubio sent to President Trump requesting the $250 million.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I applaud President Trump for working with the Florida delegation to commit to fight for $250 million in federal funding for Everglades restoration projects this year. This funding builds on the $200 million in construction funding for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration we fought for and secured last year, as well as the $2 billion in state funding invested in restoring the Everglades throughout my time as Governor. Everglades restoration is critically important to the State of Florida and enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress. I applaud the Administration&#8217;s commitment to protecting Florida&#8217;s natural treasures for generations to come.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Calls on World Health Organization to do Independent Analysis of Coronavirus  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) urging the WHO to do its own in-depth analysis on the extent of the Coronavirus. Since Communist China cannot be trusted to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner when it comes to combatting the threat of the virus, every resource must be available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Calls on General Secretary Xi to Extradite Perpetrators of the Equifax Breach  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement calling on General Security of the Communist Party Xi to hold four members of Communist China&#8217;s military accountable after the Justice Department charged them with the massive Equifax data breach in 2017.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;China continues to steal our intellectual property and personal information. While General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi claims that his goal is to improve relations between our two countries, his actions send another message. If he&#8217;s serious about working with the United States to improve our relationship, he should immediately extradite the military officials that were charged by the Justice Department for the Equifax breach in 2017. If General Security Xi and Communist China fail to do so, it will just be another sign that their promise of improved economic and political relations was more empty rhetoric from an adversary intent on competing with the United States on a global scale.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Questions Pandemic Experts on Efforts to Protect Americans from Coronavirus  During a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs roundtable on global pandemics, Senator Rick Scott questioned experts regarding the threat of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Senator Scott continues to work with the administration to protect the health of American families.&nbsp;Watch video from the roundtable HERE or below.    &#151; Sen. Rick Scott Introduces the Medical License Verification Act  Senators Rick Scott, John Cornyn, Chris Van Hollen and Catherine Cortez Masto introduced the Medical License Verification Act to prevent fraud in the healthcare system by requiring the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to verify that an applicant&#8217;s medical license is valid and in good standing prior to issuing them a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, which is required by healthcare providers to bill for insurance.&nbsp;  Under current law, CMS issues NPI numbers without verification of the licensure information submitted, which allows non-physicians to obtain NPI numbers and opens up the possibility that they may fraudulently bill commercial health insurance.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Under our current system, loopholes exist that have allowed non-doctors to fraudulently bill health insurance companies to the tune of millions of dollars, which ultimately gets passed along to the consumer. This is unfair and it has to stop. The Medical License Verification Act is a small and commonsense step to address this weakness and prevent bad actors from defrauding families.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Joins Sen. Ted Cruz and Colleagues to Introduce the&nbsp;Taiwan SOS Act  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Ted Cruz and colleagues in introducing the Taiwan Symbols of Sovereignty (Taiwan SOS) Act, which would allow diplomats and service members in the Taiwanese military to display their flag and wear their uniforms while in the United States on official businesses. &nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;As Communist China continues to try to crack down on Taiwan&#8217;s freedoms, it&#8217;s more important than ever that the United States stand strong with our ally. Taiwan is an incredible reminder of the power of democracy around the world, and I&#8217;m proud to co-sponsor this important bill to support our friends in Taiwan.&#8221; Read more from Senator Ted Cruz's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Introduces Legislation to Crack Down on U.S. Companies Selling to Huawei  Senator Rick Scott introduced legislation to close a loophole that has allowed U.S. technology companies to sell products to Huawei, which the&nbsp;U.S. Government has determined to be a national security threat and continues to be a bad actor across the globe. U.S. exports to Huawei have been banned, but some U.S. companies are finding ways around the blacklisting, including supplying Huawei through subsidiaries or partners in foreign countries.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We know Huawei is supported and controlled by the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights and steal our data, technology, and intellectual property. Companies&nbsp;in the United States should not be allowed to sell to Huawei, and my legislation will further restrict their ability. I look forward to all of my colleagues and the Administration joining in support of my proposal to crack down on U.S. exports to Huawei, protect our national security and the security and growth of the U.S. technology industry.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Calls on FDA to Confirm Pharmaceutical Imports from Communist China are Safe Amid Coronavirus  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following the FDA&#8217;s recent decision to remove the agency&#8217;s inspectors of Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities from the country in response to the Chinese Coronavirus outbreak. Senator Scott is focused on making sure that all products being imported from China are safe for American families. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.              Sen.

Every time I step on the House floor, I&#8217;m focused on legislation that will help our district - whether that&#8217;s lowering out of pocket health care costs or making sure every student gets a quality education. No matter what is happening in Washington, I won&#8217;t lose sight of the issues we face back home.&nbsp; I was especially lucky to introduce Kathy Zeman to the House Agriculture Committee earlier this week. Kathy farms in Rice County and she came to Washington to testify in support of the Local Agricultural Markets Program which promotes farmers&#8217; markets around the country.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Expanding Higher Ed Opportunities  On Tuesday, I spoke with Minnesota State about how we can expand higher ed opportunities for our students. If education isn&#8217;t affordable, it&#8217;s not accessible.   &nbsp;     Improving Rural Health CareRight now, there are insufficient health care resources in our rural communities. Wednesday, I met with folks from the Minnesota Department of Health to talk about the unique healthcare challenges facing rural patients and providers.       Advocating for Minnesota River Funding&nbsp;This week, I sat down with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and the Waterways Council to discuss the importance of the Minnesota River Dredging project in keeping the river fully operational. The river transports about 4 million tons annually, worth more than $362 Million in economic value.   &nbsp;     Pushing for Ratification of the ERA:&nbsp;Equal rights for women should not have a deadline. In fact, it&#8217;s long past time. That&#8217;s why I voted to remove the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment on Thursday.  Protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social SecurityThe President&#8217;s budget proposes cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I&#8217;ll never stand for that. Watch my video about these cuts here.&nbsp;  Supporting the Special OlympicsThis week was Special Olympics Hill Day! It was great meeting with our Minnesota delegation about empowering folks with different abilities.       Meeting Rescue PuppiesThursday, I stopped by the ASPCA Paws for Love pet adoption event to give out some belly rubs.   &nbsp;     Funding Recreational TrailsThis week, I introduced the Recreational Trails Full Funding Act of 2020 with Rep. Welch to make sure folks have quality trails to enjoy Minnesota&#8217;s four seasons for hiking, cross country skiing and taking their ATV&#8217;s out. Not only will this bill invest in these opportunities right now, but it also makes sure future generations of Minnesotans and visitors can experience the beauty of the Minnesota River Valley and our well-traveled trails from Zumbrota to Cottage Grove.&nbsp;  Upcoming Event:Excited to announce my February town hall!

And on Thursday, I&#8217;ll be hosting a community conversation on the dangerous spread of hate crimes in the United States and how to combat it. We will have a discussion with leaders of different communities on how we can together to battle this common enemy here in Minnesota and nationwide.

Pathway to Peace This week, I introduced a package of seven bills that outline a bold progressive vision to reimagines the country&#8217;s approach to foreign policy as one that centers human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America&#8217;s engagement in the world, and makes military action a last resort. I have firsthand experience with how destructive war can be&#8212;and I see how our continuous involvement in foreign conflicts is not making our country or our world any safer. I believe that when the United States says it champions human rights, democracy, and peace, we should mean it.   Eritrean Asylum ENSURE Act This administration will stop at nothing to make life painful for people of color seeking a better future. Not only has the President added Eritrea to its latest Muslim Ban, but he is also now threatening to deport Eritreans who have settled here. That&#8217;s why I introduced the ENSURE Act to stop the United States from deporting Eritreans fleeing state oppression. The bill places a two-year stay on removals; prohibits the detention of Eritrean nationals during removal procedures; and, requires up-to-date reporting on Eritreans facing imminent removal.   The PRO Act&nbsp; As a former union member myself, I can attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right to organize. That&#8217;s why we need the PRO Act, which puts power back in the hands of workers where it belongs. It will address the challenges and attacks that labor unions have been facing for decades that have led to the erosion of wages, a spike in workplace discrimination, and dangerous growth in inequality. Unions don&#8217;t only raise wages. They create working class solidarity between workers across gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.    Trump Budget This week, the Budget Committee held a hearing on President Trump&#8217;s latest spending proposals. The administration's new budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stamps&#8212;while continuing the President&#8217;s disastrous tax breaks for the rich and while increasing wasteful spending on endless wars. We need a budget for the people that invests in housing, education, healthcare, and addressing the climate crisis, not a budget that benefits billionaires like the President. The American people deserve better.       &nbsp;  Stay Updated with the Office of Representative Ilhan Omar   Please do not respond to this e-mail.&nbsp;Contact the Office  &nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSCRIBE SERVICES  Unsubscribe&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp; Privacy            ","district":"5","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"MN","party":"Democrat","score":2.5885093},{"name":"Congressman Jodey Arrington","address":"TX19JA.Outreach@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-12","subject":"NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }     p { margin-bottom:1em; }     News from Congressman Arrington                                               NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS Dear Friend,  With President's Day upon us, I find myself reflecting upon our nation's founding fathers and the principles that established these United States. Freedom and boundless opportunity are the core of American ideals. Socialism is a failed ideology that will rob our citizens of their freedom and destroy our country. We must condemn socialism in every form lest we consign the next generation of Americans as wards of the state.  Below you will find a recap of last week and to ensure you're receiving the latest updates from Washington and across West Texas I&nbsp;encourage you, and all of our fellow&nbsp;West&nbsp;Texans, to&nbsp;follow me on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and like my page on&nbsp;Facebook.  The President's FY2021 Proposed Defense Budget Reduces B-1B Fleet in Transition to B-21  Now more than ever, our military needs additional combat power to meet the threats identified in the National Defense Strategy and, as a result, both the Air Force and Congress understand the need to accelerate the deployment of the new B-21 Raider as a fundamental part of that mission. Ultimately, Congress is responsible for establishing the budget; therefore, I will be closely reviewing the administration&#8217;s recommendation and analyses and working with them to arrive at the right resources and plan for transitioning from the B-1 to the B-21 bomber in a way that ensures the most cost-effective strategy for defending our nation, the highest safety for our airmen, and the least disruption to base operations.

West Point Appointment&nbsp;  I was honored to have the privilege of informing Sam Aycock of All Saints Episcopal in Lubbock that he has been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point for the class of 2024. Born only months after 9/11, Sam was born to be a freedom fighter. To watch our phone call and Sam's reaction, click here or the image below.   National Rural Health Association's 2020 Policy Institute   I had the pleasure of speaking at the NRHA's 2020 Policy institute this week&nbsp;about the unique healthcare challenges rural communities face.&nbsp;If we are going to maintain the ability to feed and clothe our own people and fuel the American economy, we need a strong and sustainable rural healthcare system.    Special Olympics  A highlight of my week was meeting Shelby who is a Houston Rodeo champion and Special Olympics athlete.&nbsp;I&#8217;m inspired by the Special Olympic's mission of community inclusion and the opportunities they provide.&nbsp;    Happy Birthday, Texas Tech!  There was no better way to celebrate 97 years of Fearless Champions than beating TCU by nearly 50 points on Tuesday. Happy birthday to my alma mater and congratulations to the Red Raider Men's basketball team on an exciting win.  Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative.

K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960. The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.&nbsp;Read the press release and full resolution here.  Background:    The Greensboro Four sit-in protest took place on February 1, 1960. The Greensboro sit-in was a civil rights protest that commenced when four young Black students staged a sit-in at the segregated lunch counter of F.W. Woolworth Department Store in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Greensboro Four: Jabreel Khazan (Ezell Blair Jr.), David Richmond, Franklin McCain and Joseph McNeil were students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, now known as North Carolina A&amp;T State University. Nationwide participation in this new movement included over 700,000 people, including students, clergymen and unified citizens both White and Black. On July 26, 1960, the Woolworth Lunch Counter was finally integrated.    &nbsp;     CBC Leadership Summit&nbsp;        &nbsp;    On February 4, 2020, the Congressional Black Caucus hosted the 2020 National Black Leadership Summit. Over 600 Black leaders from around the country joined the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C. to call national attention to two critical issues facing the Black community: the 2020 Census and Voting Rights.&nbsp; Both have implications for the development of Black communities in the short and long term.&nbsp; The Summit also&nbsp;featured one of North Carolina's own, Rev. Dr. William Barber II, who delivered the keynote address.&nbsp; Recording of the February 4, 2020 Summit can be viewed on the Congressional Black Caucus' Facebook page&nbsp;here.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Fighting for Medicaid Protections     &nbsp;  &nbsp;   On February 6, 2020, Congressman Butterfield spoke on the House floor in opposition to the Trump Administration's illegal Medicaid block grant scheme which would threaten access to healthcare for millions of North Carolinians including vulnerable children and those who are low income, elderly, and disabled. The House of Representatives passed a resolution to disapprove of the Trump administration&#8217;s latest plan to allow states to convert part of their Medicaid programs into block grants. See Butterfield's full speech here.&nbsp;  &nbsp;     Legislative Update&nbsp;       On January 30, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congressman Billy Long (MO-07) introduced the&nbsp;Protecting Natural Gas Consumers from Overcharges Act of 2020.&nbsp; The bipartisan bill aims to protect natural gas consumers, residential and industrial, from overpaying for their use of natural gas.&nbsp; The bill amends the National Gas Act to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to set a refund effective date and order a refund when an interstate pipeline is found to be overcharging for its services.&nbsp; FERC currently has these authorities under the Federal Power Act to order refunds from interstate electric utilities when they determine overcharges have been made. On January 28, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960. The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.&nbsp; On January 27, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-1) and Congressmen Mike Conaway (TX-11) introduced H. Res. 810, a resolution to recognize Free File, a public-private partnership allowing low- and moderate-income taxpayers to use tax preparation software and e-filing services at no cost to the government.     Constituent Success Story     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  The district office in Durham received a request for help from a 95-year-old widow of a WWII Veteran for assistance with the Department of Veterans Affairs. For many years, this constituent had not received her benefits and the Durham&nbsp;office staff&nbsp;was determined to find a solution. After extensive research, many emails, calls and conversations, the district staff was able to identify the error and secured a back payment of &nbsp;$14,323 as well as a $979 a month pension for the rest of the constituent's life. The constituent and her family expressed deep gratitude for the help of the Durham staff. It is an honor to serve as advocates for the constituents of North Carolina's First Congressional District.

The President&#8217;s State of the Union address detailed the incredible accomplishments America has achieved in the last year. Our middle class is booming and the unemployment rate is as low as it&#8217;s been in half a century. Seven million jobs have been created under his leadership, and in Missouri, real median household income is up eight percent. The economy continues to grow, lifting up working families and creating greater opportunities for the next generation. President Trump has said he would get to work for America, and he told us all how he has kept that promise. He has made it a priority to lower prescription drug costs, secure our border, and combat human trafficking. I will continue to work with him for our suburban families to advance critical initiatives such as passing paid parental leave legislation, addressing the skyrocketing costs of childcare, and ensuring our national security remains strong. Now that President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment, it is time Congress got back to the People&#8217;s business of governing and build on his record of achievements for the American people. Read my State of the Union press release here. I introduced&nbsp;bipartisan legislation with my colleagues to help prevent repeated community flooding. We must help regions at risk of repeat flooding become more resilient. By incentivizing communities to plan ahead for damaging floods, we can avoid continually subsidizing the rebuilding of flood-prone properties through the National Flood Insurance Program. This bill aims to prevent loss of life and property and help communities withstand major floods like those we have recently experienced in Missouri. Read more about the bill here. Republicans introduced a privileged resolution to admonish the Speaker for ripping up the President&#8217;s State of the Union address. Her action was a slap in the face to the President, the dignity of the House, and all of the Americans the President honored in his speech. Democrats should allow us to vote on this legislation so they can go on record and tell the country whether they support such behavior or not.   I had the honor of singing in the National Prayer Breakfast Congressional Choir with my colleagues.&nbsp;This is such a moving event, and I was blessed to attend.   It was great speaking to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) to discuss our work in Congress against human trafficking. Financial institutions are critical partners in the fight against trafficking, and I look forward to working with banks, non-profits, and law enforcement as we find new ways to identify traffickers and help victims find justice. I was honored to receive an award from ACAMS for my work in the fight against trafficking and appreciate their support and partnership.   The purpose of U.S. global health and economic development programming is to recognize, promote, and protect the dignity of all individuals, and to extend a helping hand so that the marginalized, poor, and vulnerable around the world may build a better future. Abortion is not compatible with this mission. Children and families should not be enumerated as barriers to prosperity, but seen as sources of strength, beauty, purpose, meaning, and potential. We will not make the challenge of ending poverty a &#8220;little simpler&#8221; in the short term by pushing women to end the lives of their children. Instead, we will continue to ensure that all women and children have access to healthcare, opportunity, and success. During our Foreign Affairs hearing on women and global health, I asked our witnesses how we can better help women have both their baby and their dreams. We also discussed how abortion is a key driver of gendercide, the global epidemic of violence against women and girls.    I had a great visit with kids from Step Up St. Louis and the Jefferson County Drug Prevention Coalition to talk about the many ways they are working to educate students on the many dangers of addiction and how they can identify the signs.&nbsp;   Sincerely,   Ann WagnerMember of Congress                                        Washington, DC Office2350 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: 202-225-1621    Ballwin District Office301 Sovereign CourtSuite 201Ballwin, MO 63011Phone: 636-779-5449               Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email If you no longer want to receive these emails, please click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to unsubscribe.&nbsp; Please DO NOT reply to this email.

Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Concluding the Senate Impeachment Trial On Wednesday, the Senate Impeachment Trial concluded after votes on both Articles of Impeachment. Both articles failed to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove a President from office, with 48-52 and 47-53 votes respectively. When I took the oath at the beginning of this trial, I vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law. I took this oath and responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until I heard arguments from both the House managers and President Trumps lawyers. After hearing from both sides and asking multiple questions  , I voted no on conviction and removal of the president. I came to this conclusion after three major considerations. First, in order to avoid a system of government where the president serves at the political pleasure of Congress, the Framers intended impeachment and removal to be reserved for extreme and rare situations. The alleged facts contained in the articles and presented by the impeachment managers do not rise to this level. Second, the House failed in its prosecutorial role by not presenting specific statutory charges against the president. Our Constitution demands of the justice system that prosecutors bring specific charges and prove each element of those charges beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, neither of the articles passed by the House contain statutory allegations to which the Senate could determine whether the elements for conviction were met. On the floor, the House managers argued that the statutory crime of bribery was contained in the first Article of Impeachment related to abuse of power. In addition to the fact that there is no evidence in the record that satisfies the statutory elements of bribery, the Senate cannot substitute its own charges or charges made by House managers on the floor for those contained within the House-passed Articles of Impeachment. Third, the House failed to meet its evidentiary burden and attempted to shift that burden to the Senate. Unwilling to give the judicial system the time to answer important questions of executive privilege in regards to specific witnesses that the House managers claimed were key to the case, the House moved forward with impeachment. The House managers argued at the beginning of the trial that they had overwhelming evidence supporting impeachment. It was surprising then that the House managers attempted to burden the Senate with issuing subpoenas and taking testimony from those witnesses that the House failed to pursue. Regardless, additional evidence or witnesses would not change the material underlying facts describing the presidents actions. These actions are not high crimes and misdemeanors as described by the Constitution, and therefore, I voted no  on conviction and removal of the president.  Supporting the Presidents State of the Union Priorities On Tuesday evening, President Trump delivered the State of the Union  , offering Congress and the American people the opportunity to hear directly from the President of the United States regarding his vision for Americas future. I was pleased the president discussed trade, our economy, STEM education, and support for our military and veterans. President Trump highlighted accomplishments have hopefully made on establishing fairer trade with China and signing the historic United States Mexico-Canada Agreement. New trade opportunities will help provide Kansas farmers and manufacturers with markets to sell their products around the world. As Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with President Trump to pass and implement policies that prioritize veterans and ensure they receive the care they deserve. I was honored to bring veteran and Kansas Representative Chris Croft to the State of the Union as my guest, and I appreciate the president hosting a number of veterans to the State of the Union as his guests to honor their service and the success they have achieved after service. President Trump also conveyed his wish for Congress to fully fund NASAs Artemis program. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science. I am committed to ensuring NASA has the necessary resources for our country to once again put Americans on the moon, furthering our national security and scientific priorities. I look forward to working with President Trump and the administration on the many issues discussed to deliver positive results for Kansans and all Americans.  Hosting Kansas Representative Chris Croft I invited  Kansas Representative Chris Croft, who represents the 8th district in Overland Park to the U.S. Capitol as my guest at the State of the Union. He is both a veteran and an advocate for veterans in his role as a Kansas representative. He served in the U.S. Army for 30 years and after retiring as a Colonel was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. Rep. Croft is dedicated to his country, to Kansas and to our nations veterans, and I was honored to have him join me at the State of the Union as my guest. During his time in the Army, Rep. Croft served in Iraq and was selected as the executive director for the Center for Army Leadership at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In that role, he helped create the Armys first leader development manual and assisted U.S. allies around the world to establish their own leadership centers. He received the distinction as the longest-serving director of the Armys Leadership Center. After retiring from the Army, Rep. Croft continued his service by running for the Kansas House of Representatives. He was elected as the representative for the 8th district in 2018 and was selected to serve on the Veteran and Military Affairs Committee. Croft is working to pass legislation to help establish a new home for veterans in northeast Kansas. Thank you to Rep. Croft for joining me.  Chairing a Hearing on the VA Community Care Network On Wednesday, I convened my first hearing  as Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. The focus was providing oversight to the VAs efforts to implement the Community Care Network (CCN), a component of the VA MISSION Act. This legislation directed the VA to create a network of community providers as an alternative for veterans when the VA is unable to provide timely or quality care. While we are still in the early stages of network deployment, the committee took the opportunity to have a discussion about the CCN with the VA, the companies responsible for building this network and other stakeholders. I shared my concerns regarding network adequacy and pushed the VA to use uniform access standards throughout the CCN, which will make it easier for veterans to receive community care. The CCN will go live in Kansas next month and a robust network will be vital to guarantee our rural veterans receive timely healthcare. In my opening statement, I noted how Kansas Big First Congressional District is as large as the State of Illinois, but lacks a VA Medical Center. For veterans in rural areas, MISSIONs Community Care Network is essential for timely healthcare. As Chairman, I will continue to hold oversight hearings to make certain veterans are receiving the care and benefits they deserve.  Discussing Solutions to World Hunger and Development Issues I was pleased to join World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley and United States Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) leadership on Tuesday for a discussion about solutions to global hunger and development issues. As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus and member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture and State and Foreign Operations, hunger and development issues are some of my top priorities in the Senate. International food aid and development programs provide many benefits to Americans, including preventing violence and unrest overseas and markets for the commodities produced by Kansas farmers and ranchers. This discussion focused on solutions to these important problems, including what Congress should be focusing on in the future. I look forward to continuing to work with my Senate colleagues on alleviating these global issues. Pictured below is President and CEO of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition Liz Schrayer, Executive Directory Beasley and Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.).  Speaking at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting On Tuesday, I was honored to speak at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. I spoke about trade and the challenges that farmers and ranchers have faced in Kansas and around the country. Due to disrupted trade markets, weather disasters, and low commodity prices, net farm income is down by 50 percent since 2013. The work of ag lenders is very important for farmers and ranchers in rural communities to have access to credit, in good times and bad. I would like to thank Jeff Shipp for giving me the opportunity to speak at their meeting.  Reacting to the CBOs Budget & Economic Outlook Report This week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030 Report  . The report details projections on the rising levels of federal deficits, debts and spending in the decade to come. The CBOs projections make clear the unsustainable fiscal path that the country finds itself on. Their analysis highlights the rapid expansion of mandatory spending programs in our government, projecting that these programs will account for 65 percent of total government spending by the end of the decade. With the growth of mandatory spending programs outpacing the growth of revenue, Congress has the responsibility to produce a plan that ensures future generations do not bear the burdens of harmful spending. As a member of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, & Science, I will work to ensure that the spending bills are fiscally responsible and do not threaten the economic growth and opportunity of our children and grandchildren.

Our country is stronger today than it has been in years - our economy, our military, our families, our environment, and our communities are stronger. This is thanks in large part to three years of an administration that has made it a point to get government off the backs of hardworking Americans and put America first. Americans across the county are experiencing a \"blue-collar boom.\" We have historically low unemployment, and more Americans are working today than ever before. Industries like construction, healthcare are adding jobs at a robust pace.   Labor participation and wages are rising, especially for the bottom 10 percent of earners. More than 2.5 million Americans have risen out of poverty. In Florida, 630,000 more jobs have been created. Florida homeownership is up 3 percentage points. Real, per-capita income is up 7 percent since the President&#8217;s election.  From appointing judges who know and respect the U.S. Constitution; to improving the VA and veteran services; to reducing tax burdens on small business owners and taxpayers; to streamlining and removing unnecessary red-tape that blocked infrastructure investments; to improving our trade agreements for American workers, manufacturers and builders; securing our borders; to and rebuilding our military &#8211; President Trump has kept his promises. The President also spoke of the bipartisan success that has been achieved in Washington when Democrats quit playing politics and come to the negotiating table. Under President Trump's administration, including USMCA and a phase One trade deal with China. Another bipartisan achievement is the \"First Step Act,\" which allows inmates serving for drug-related crimes to receive a second chance. I hope my colleagues &#8211; Democrat and Republican alike &#8211; will put aside politics and work together to invest in our country&#8217;s infrastructure, improve border security and reduce and prioritize spending. President Trump&#8217;s address also included compelling stories of Americans coming from all walks of life. These guests&#8217; lives illustrate his inspiring message that \"Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!\"            (Video of Guests)  _______________  On Friday, the Department of Labor released the January jobs report. Employers added 225,000 jobs in the first month of 2020. &nbsp;Perhaps more importantly, wages have increased 3.1% from last year.&nbsp; This report smashes expectations and continues to show that policies reducing regulations and lowering taxes is getting people across the country back into the workforce. The U.S. economy is positioned to fuel more economic growth this year.            ______________ President Trump's message to terrorists has been clear, \"You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life.\" On Thursday, our military conducted a counterterrorism operation in Yemen that successfully killed Qasim al-Rimi, founder and leader of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and deputy to al-Qa'ida top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. al-Rimi joined the terrorist group in the 1990s and worked for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Under al-Rimi, AQAP committed countless attacks against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire attacks against the United States. His death damages AQAP and the al-Qa'ida regime and brings the U.S. closer to eliminating the threats these terror groups pose to our national security.  _______________  Each year, the U.S. Congress hosts the Congressional Art Competition. This unique competition allows me to showcase the artistic talents of high school students within the 11th&nbsp;District. &nbsp;The winning entries from each district are prominently displayed in the Cannon Tunnel to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. The competition is open to high school students only, including home educated students. Each student may enter one piece of artwork that illustrates this year&#8217;s theme, the \"Wonders of Florida.\" &nbsp;For guidelines, deadlines and more specific information, please visit my website.    (2019 Congressional Art Competition Winner)  _______________  Cindy Brown from my local office recently attended The Villages Giving Clubs Showcase. The purpose of this event is to showcase the many clubs, organizations, and groups that work to give back to our community, our region, and the world at large. At least 36 clubs participated. One of the clubs was Angel Snugs from the Villages. Jen Smith and Bonnie Mulneix - leaders of The Villages Angel Snugs club, showcased their mission to teach volunteers to knit, crochet and loom hats. These items are then shipped to 80 pediatric hospitals around the country to help comfort children that have lost their hair due to chemotherapy cancer treatments.&nbsp;    _______________  Last week, my District Director Christa Pearson participated in the First Annual Hernando Grown Student Conference. She spoke to Hernando County high school students about their next steps in achieving their educational and career goals after high school. Thank you and congratulations to all involved in a great inaugural event!     Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress  &nbsp; Constituent Corner A member of the Florida Army National Guard stated that he never received the reenlistment signing bonus he had agreed to when renewing his contract in February 2019.&nbsp; Our office inquired into the situation and learned that a recent backlog had been cleared and that the payment was scheduled to be applied to his retirement fund.  Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.&nbsp;  District Update Pam Jones from my local office attended the American Heart Association &#8220;Wear Red for Heart Health&#8221; along with UF Health Leesburg Hospital. &#8220;Wear Red for Heart Health&#8221; is the American Heart Association&#8217;s yearly campaign to raise awareness for women to act against their number 1 killer &#8211; heart disease. Dr. Michelle Wood, who is an obstetrician&#8211;gynecologist in Leesburg was the guest speaker and shared tips on heart health for women.    Legislative Update Last week the House passed H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness Act. This bill repeals a mandate from the 2006 passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which required the USPS to fully pre-fund future retiree health care benefits. This requirement is unique to the USPS and has financially crippled the postal service.&nbsp; By removing this mandate, the USPS has the flexibility to use revenues to improve services and compete while still funding retirement benefits in a sustainable manner. I am a strong supporter of the USPS and a co-sponsor of this bill. This legislation now moves onto the U.S. Senate for consideration.    &nbsp; Results of  which asked... \"Do you plan on watching President Trump&#8217;s State of the Union Address on Tuesday, February 4th?\"&nbsp;  Yes - 81%  No - 15%  Unsure - 4%        &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington1210 LongworthWashington, DC 20515202-225-1002 Leesburg318 South 2nd St #ALeesburg, FL 34748352-241-9220 Inverness212 W.

Whether through tax reform, trade deals, deregulation, a secured border, a rebuilt military, or America&#8217;s energy revolution, the President&#8217;s record of delivering real results for the American people cannot be denied. Now it&#8217;s time to put division aside, work with President Trump, and renew our focus on tackling unifying issues like infrastructure, education, and high prescription drug costs. In case you missed it, watch&nbsp;President Trump&#8217;s address here.&nbsp;    _____________________________________________________________  President Trump Acquitted   The Senate voted to acquit President Trump after a long, partisan process. Shortly before the vote, I went to the Senate Floor to give my closing remarks on the impeachment trial and to announce I would be voting to acquit the President. The two articles which came before the Senate were without merit. They were an affront to the institution and to our Constitution, representing the very same partisan derangement that worried our Founding Fathers so much that they made the threshold for impeachment this high. I did not arrive at my conclusion to support acquittal hastily or flippantly, and I don&#8217;t believe any of my colleagues did either, including those who come to a different conclusion from mine. Watch my remarks below.    _____________________________________________________________  Clarifying WPA Easement Director&#8217;s Order  Robert Wallace, the U.S. Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks joined a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee oversight hearing in which we discussed the recent Director&#8217;s Order on Waterfowl Production Area (WPA) Easements. I chair the EPW Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife and at the hearing, sought clarification on the process of implementing the Order, the expected timeline, the newly-established appeals process, and the future release of these maps.    The Director&#8217;s Order addresses a longstanding and serious problem for many North Dakota landowners. The Order is the direct result of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt&#8217;s visit to Hope, North Dakota, last October&nbsp;where he heard directly from landowners. The Order promises new maps overlaid on aerial imagery, detailing the boundaries and acreage of its easements to landowners, and provides the first-ever administrative appeals process for landowners who have FWS easements pre-dating 1976 on their property. I wrote a Letter to the Editor for the Minot Daily News, outlining what North Dakotans whose lands have these pre-1976 WPA easements should expect. The success of this first-ever appeals process depends on public involvement. Read my piece here.  _____________________________________________________________  USDA Issues Third Round of MFP Payments   The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the third and final tranche of 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments. I&#8217;m grateful to President Trump and Secretary Perdue for their continued support for American agriculture. These payments come at an important time for our producers, who face uncertainty in the Chinese market. The Trump Administration&#8217;s recognition of our producers as a target of unfair retaliation is noticed and appreciated. _____________________________________________________________  Migratory Bird Treaty Act  President Trump&#8217;s Administration released a proposed rule&nbsp;to define the scope of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Under the Obama Administration&#8217;s interpretation of the MBTA, anyone could be prosecuted without even making a deliberate effort to kill species protected by the MBTA. Had it not been stopped in court, this interpretation would have had severely negative consequences for North Dakotans. The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee discussed the proposed rule during a Fish &amp; Wildlife Service oversight hearing. In North Dakota, we had three oil companies zealously prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office over 28 birds that inadvertently flew into the company&#8217;s pits. These companies were lawfully practicing commercial activities and never intentionally sought to harm these birds, yet they were criminally prosecuted. The previous US Attorney&#8217;s actions against these companies and workers were more of a representation of their hatred of the industry than it was the love of birds. The new proposal is common sense and I applaud the Trump Administration&#8217;s efforts.&nbsp;Watch the exchange here.&nbsp;  _____________________________________________________________  Discussing ISR and Space Force at SASC  During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the U.S. Southern Command Commander Adm. Craig Faller and U.S. Africa Command Commander Gen. Stephen Townsend came in to discuss their needs for the upcoming fiscal year. During this time, I addressed their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) needs like those provided by the MQ-9 in Fargo and the Global Hawks in Grand Forks. Each Commander reported receiving 25 percent or less of the ISR capabilities they need. I also inquired as to how the newly created U.S. Space Force could assist in their respective missions. Our full exchange is below.    _____________________________________________________________  Introducing Teleabortion Prevention Act I joined Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana to introduce the Teleabortion Prevention Act, which would make it a federal offense for healthcare providers to perform a chemical abortion without first physically examining the patient, being present during the chemical abortion, and scheduling a follow-up visit for the patient. Proponents of abortion say it should be a safe, rare decision made between a mother and a qualified doctor, but now there is a movement to provide abortions with little-to-no consultation with a physician. Killing an unborn child is wrong, and encouraging women to undergo that procedure without knowing the impact is egregious. Our pro-life legislation counters these efforts and works to protect mothers and unborn children. _____________________________________________________________  North Dakotans in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;    It's always nice to see my friends from Grain Growers in Washington. We covered a wide range of topics affecting them, including RMA issues, WPA easements, MFP payments, wetland setbacks, and the Phase One trade deal with China.   Visiting with North Dakota&#8217;s Tribal College students is one of my favorite meetings every year. I&#8217;m inspired by their stories and grateful for our time together. We discussed issues unique to tribal colleges including broadband, cultural education and degree programs. _____________________________________________________________  Contact Me  My offices are open in Bismarck, Grand Forks, Minot, Fargo and Washington, D.C.

Last Tuesday, Julie Erick, a Fullerton resident and breast cancer survivor, was my honored guest at the State of the Union Address. She relies on the pre-existing condition protections from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to receive her post-cancer treatment. Without the ACA, Julie would have been denied coverage or charged outrageously high premiums. It&#8217;s disappointing the President has undermined our healthcare law and endangered these vital protections for the past three years. I will continue to fight to protect the ACA for the more than 320,700 residents in the 39th District, like Julie, who have a pre-existing condition.    On Thursday, I voted to protect and strengthen workers&#8217; rights by passing H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. This bill aims to strengthen workers&#8217; ability to form unions, negotiate larger paychecks and greater benefits, and provide safer working conditions. It&#8217;s outrageous that American families are working too hard for too little, and it&#8217;s far past time we build an economy that works for everyone. This past week also marked National Gun Violence Survivors Week. In remembrance of the lives that have been scarred by gun violence, I delivered a floor speech sharing my family&#8217;s experience with gun violence and urging the Senate and President to pass gun safety legislation.

As President Trump demonstrated, the United States is thriving. The economy is booming for working Americans of all backgrounds, our nation has been made safer by eliminating terrorists like Qassem Soleimani, and we achieved bipartisan successes on criminal justice reform and the USMCA. While Tuesday night provided an opportunity to reflect on our nation&#8217;s successful last three years, we must continue to pursue reforms that improve Americans&#8217; lives. To that point, I am introducing legislation to increase transparency in our healthcare costs. Titled the Fair and Honest Advanced Cost Estimate for Patients Act, this bill requires healthcare providers and facilities to work with insurers to provide a cost estimate for scheduled services directly to individuals. Thus, both privately insured and uninsured individuals will no longer be blindsided by the cost of their healthcare services. I am hopeful this bill will be another bipartisan triumph for the American people. Sincerely,   Devin NunesMember of Congress Pleases note that this account does not accept incoming messages.

I use this as a venue to tell the story of how the work I'm doing in Washington and in the district impacts you. Each week I will highlight important pieces of legislation I'm working on, show you how I'm engaging with constituents on the issues, and tell you about upcoming events in the district.&nbsp;This week I'm back in Washington working on important legislation to improve public access to water in the Valley. Here are some highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Fighting for water   &nbsp; Water is the lifeblood of our Valley. Farmers need water to feed the world and life becomes near impossible for residents who lack clean drinking water. I introduced a bill to provide funding for necessary repairs to the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct. These waterways are critical to supporting our Valley's water needs, yet they are decades old and showing their age. We need to invest in our water infrastructure now, for the future sustainability of our state.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Expanding healthcare access           &nbsp;  California is expected to face a massive shortfall of primary care doctors in the next 15 years, especially in rural and low-income communities.&nbsp;I recently introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act to increase our supply of doctors by providing funding for additional medical training in diverse and medically deprived communities, like the San Joaquin Valley. At this year's State of the Union, I invited one of our local dedicated Valley health professionals to be my guest:&nbsp;Enid Picart.&nbsp;A fourth year medical student at UCSF-Fresno, Enid has chosen to dedicate her career to improving healthcare for San Joaquin Valley residents. We need more passionate people like Enid, who know our communities, to stay and commit to our future. With an investment in them, we can ensure every Valley resident has access to the healthcare they deserve. &nbsp;        Rep. Costa with State of the Union guest Enid Picart.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Honoring a hometown hero           &nbsp;  I introduced a resolution to honor&nbsp;a&nbsp;pioneer in the Latino community and Fresno native, Tom Flores, and urge he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Coach Flores was recently passed over for&nbsp;the honor despite his noteworthy achievements in the sport. As the first Latino starting quarterback and&nbsp;head coach to win two Super Bowls with the Raiders, and&nbsp;first Latino head coach and&nbsp;general manager of the Seattle Seahawks and in professional football history, his accomplishments on the gridiron prove he is&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;deserving of this honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Improving Valley infrastructure  &nbsp;  I'm pleased to announce that Merced County is opening Phase II of Campus Parkway and breaking ground on Phase III. When completed, this vital infrastructure project will connect UC Merced to both Highway 140 and Highway 99, improving traffic circulation, and&nbsp;providing better&nbsp;access to health services and economic opportunity. Working together in a bipartisan effort is key to improving our Valley's infrastructure.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Supporting global women's health   &nbsp; As a strong supporter of reproductive rights throughout my career, I believe it is critical for the United States to fund programs that improve the lives of millions of women around the world. In a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, we discussed the Global Gag Rule and other policies of this Administration to restrict access to family planning tools. Many of these policies have undermined the United States' commitment to global public health and resulted in economic and physical harm to women around the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Pushing for responsible forest management  &nbsp;  One of my top priorities is to see our taxpayer dollars come back to the district. I'm pleased to report that the Fresno Regional Workforce and Development Board (FRWDB) secured an important CalFire grant to improve the health of our forests. Wildfires in California continue to have devastating impacts on our economy and air quality in the Valley. This new partnership will create 100 new skilled forestry jobs to help alleviate these effects. If we are to combat these growing threats, we need to bolster our efforts to responsibly manage our forests.&nbsp;   Other work on behalf of our Valley:&nbsp;  Voted to advance  that would provide funding to counter the damage Nutria are doing to our waterways in California.  about how legislation I helped introduce will&nbsp;&nbsp;for disadvantaged communities. The bill would also&nbsp;&nbsp;to increase storage and supply in our Valley.  to expand services and benefits to victims of Agent Orange exposure.  &nbsp;   Meeting of the Week:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's always a pleasure to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. This year at the United Nations Holocaust Observance, we had a productive discussion about building the relationship between the UN and our government in Washington, the UN's role in combating the climate crisis, and working to improve collaboration with our transatlantic partners. I will continue working with the UN and other nations around the world to promote global peace and prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upcoming Events Across the District:     &nbsp;  AARP Foundation Tax-Aide  &nbsp;  Free tax help for those with low- and moderate incomes, with special attention paid to those aged 60 and over.

Congressman Hagedorn is pleased to report that hardworking southern Minnesotans have benefited from a number of achievements in January, including final passage of the USMCA and Phase One of the U.S.-China Trade Agreement being signed by the president. These trade wins mean protecting our jobs and better market access for our agriculture, manufacturing and medical products. The 2019 final jobs report reflects this sentiment as well, showing near record low unemployment and rising wages in Minnesota. Jim&#8217;s small contractors legislation also passed the House in January, making our small businesses more competitive when bidding for prime contracts. Additionally, Hagedorn has now completed 16 of the 21 stops on his district-wide Town Hall Tour, which is set to be complete in February. Rep. Hagedorn started off the month of February by focusing efforts on expanding working families&#8217; access to affordable, quality childcare services by signing on as an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Small Business Child Care Investment Act. This legislation works to expand access to childcare by granting non-profit childcare providers access to the same types of&nbsp;Small Business Administration (SBA) loans available to for-profit companies. For more updates from Rep. Hagedorn, subscribe to his newsletter&nbsp;and follow him on&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Twitter.  &nbsp;  January 8: &#8220;Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act&#8221; Receives Bipartisan Support  Jim speaks on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of his bill, H.R. 5146, the &#8220;Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act,&#8221; which works to remove barriers to entry for small businesses seeking to compete for federal prime contracts by requiring contract officers to consider the relevant past performance and subcontractor experience of these companies. The House adopted Hagedorn&#8217;s legislation by voice vote. Watch below:   &nbsp;  January 10: SKOL Vikings  Jim and his Minnesota delegation colleagues come together in bipartisan fashion to cheer on the Vikings ahead of their playoff game against the 49ers.   &nbsp; January 15: Hagedorn Meets SBA Administrator Carranza  The House Small Business Committee Republicans host newly appointed SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza. Jim and the administrator discuss how they can work together to promote small businesses and expand economic opportunity in southern Minnesota and across the nation.   &nbsp; January 20: Rocky County Pork Producers Annual Banquet  Jim enjoys excellent food and a huge crowd as he speaks at the Rock County Pork Producers Annual Banquet in Luverne.   &nbsp; January 21: Working on the Railroad  Jim discusses rail transportation issues with Ellis &amp; Eastern Company and how the work they do helps bolster the local and national economies. Hagedorn is working alongside them to help secure improvements for the short-line railroad.   &nbsp; January 22-23: Making Soy and Corn Great Again  At the MN Ag Expo in Mankato, Jim addresses the Soybean and Corn Growers Associations and talks with farmers from across Minnesota about USMCA and other trade agreements, implementing the Renewable Fuel Standard as Congress intended, and his legislative efforts to prevent the spread of African swine fever into the U.S.   &nbsp; January 26: Council of Carpenters Training Facility  The North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters show Jim their first-class training facilities in Rochester and along the way discuss&nbsp;the need to limit onerous regulations to keep the robust economy growing, expand America&#8217;s skilled workforce, and protect high-quality medical care and excellent healthcare benefits for trade workers.   &nbsp; January 29: #USMCAnow  Jim attends the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) signing ceremony at the White House. Before the ceremony, Jim visits with Vice President Mike Pence to discuss the rural economy, the pork industry, and how opening new markets for farmers and manufacturers will help the American people.       &nbsp;

The MPP allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to return applicants for admission to the United States to Mexico, pending their asylum application hearings. I&#8217;ve visited refugee camps around the world, and the conditions that the U.S. government is forcing these asylum-seekers to suffer are a disgrace to our nation and our shared values.&nbsp;   Congressman DeFazio standing in front of a makeshift shelter in the city of Matamoros, Mexico, which contains the largest refugee camp along the U.S.-Mexico Border of an estimated 2,000 people.  In Matamoros, I witnessed roughly 3,000 individuals living in squalor. Half are children. It is so dangerous, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisory&#8212;the same as Iran and Syria&#8212;for the area. The Mexican cartel operates openly and freely, and kidnapping, violence, and sexual assault are rampant. I met one woman who had fled El Salvador with her three daughters. Every night she sleeps outside her tent, on the zipper, to protect her daughters from being kidnapped and forced into sex trafficking. Despite widespread disease, including numerous cases of chronic infections, medical care is woefully inadequate. Basic infrastructure is also almost non-existent: open latrines filled with raw sewage exist immediately next to the Rio Grande, the contaminated river where families wash their laundry.&nbsp;  On the day of their hearing, individuals must arrive at the border checkpoint by 4:30 AM. Most petitioners are unable to see their court paperwork until that day. Approximately one percent of asylum-seekers have a lawyer, and if they are lucky enough to have representation, they usually meet their lawyer for the first time on the day of their hearing. They are given, at most, an hour to discuss their case and the hearing.&nbsp;  An estimated 60,000 asylum seekers have been forced back into Mexico under the MPP. Of those 60,000, roughly 120 have been granted asylum or some other relief.  We need to end the Remain in Mexico policy now. That&#8217;s why I am one of roughly 50 members of Congress cosponsoring H.R. 2662, the Asylum Seeker Protection Act, which would terminate the deplorable MPP program.&nbsp;  I hope more members of Congress go to Matamoros to bear witness to these conditions for themselves. Perhaps then Congress will finally have the courage to act.  Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr, &nbsp;His Legacy, and the Fight for Equality On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I was honored to address members of the Eugene community about Dr. King&#8217;s legacy of equality and the incredible contributions of women across the nation and in our community to promote equity. Since taking office, the president and the GOP have implemented policies that threaten the rights &nbsp;of women and people of color.&nbsp;  I am frustrated that many hard-won civil rights battles are at risk in today&#8217;s political climate. As my friend and colleague, civil rights hero Congressman John Lewis noted, &#8220;Of all the gifts given us by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I think the greatest has been the belief in society&#8217;s ability to change and the power each of us has to affect that change.&nbsp; We must not give up our fight.&#8221;   &#8220;There is no expiration date on equality,&#8221; Watch my full remarks to the Eugene MLK Jr. Day March here.  In January, Virginia became the pivotal 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), finally guaranteeing equal protections regardless of sex in our nation&#8217;s Constitution. With Virginia&#8217;s action, the ERA could finally be added to our Constitution &#8211; but the Trump administration&#8217;s Department of Justice is determined to stop this from happening and has issued a legal opinion arguing that the ratification deadline has passed. Well to them I say this &#8211; there is no expiration date on equality.  I am a proud cosponsor of H.J.Res. 38, legislation which would lift the arbitrary ERA ratification deadline. Majority Leader Hoyer has already announced his intention to bring this important legislation to the floor next month, and I look forward to giving it my full &nbsp;support.&nbsp;  I have also cosponsored and voted for legislation to fight for equality, such as tackling the wage discrimination that women and minorities face (H.R. 7 &#8211; Paycheck Fairness Act), protecting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault (H.R. 1585 &#8211; Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act), and protecting a women&#8217;s right to choose (H.R. 2975, Women&#8217;s Health Protection Act, H.R. 1692 &#8211; EACH Woman Act).&nbsp;  Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a priority to fight for equality. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment which guaranteed women&#8217;s constitutional right to vote, you can be sure I will continue to do everything in my power to defend a woman&#8217;s right to choose, protect access to critical healthcare, and strive to ensure the ERA&#8217;s addition to our Constitution. Discussing Science and Policy with OSU Students Last week, I spoke with Oregon State University students at a Science and Policy class taught by Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a world-renowned environmental scientist who served as the U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and served as an inaugural member of President Barack Obama&#8217;s Science Team from 2009-2013. We discussed the importance of integrating fact-based science and policy to inform policymakers on the existential crisis of climate change.  On the &nbsp;same day, a new report from NOAA revealed the devastating effects climate change is already inflicting on Dungeness crabs fisheries in the Pacific Northwest. The study found that ocean acidification along the Pacific Northwest is impacting the shells and sensory organs of Dungeness crabs, which could cause developmental delays and interfere with maturation. The Dungeness crab fishery is a multi-million-dollar industry in Oregon, and the report is one more disturbing example of just how urgent and overdue legislative action is. That&#8217;s why I am a cosponsor of the COAST Research Act, which would address the effects of ocean acidification on our marine ecosystems. This legislation, which passed the House with my full support last year, would reauthorize the Ocean Acidification Program of NOAA and expand research efforts to monitor the effects of coastal acidification. While I am proud that the House was able to pass this legislation, there is much more work that needs to be done to protect our oceans and address climate change.&nbsp;  The ability to protect the environment and address climate change is dependent on the foundation of science that is independently verifiable and free from political interference or bias, ideology, and conflicts of interests. I have and will continue to promote policies that are based in science, protect our environment, and reduce carbon pollution. Juliana v. United States Case Dismissed, But Not Defeated&nbsp; I&#8217;m angered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals&#8217; dismissal of the landmark&nbsp;Juliana v. United States, a&nbsp;constitutional climate lawsuit led by 21 youth plaintiffs, including seven from Oregon&#8217;s 4th Congressional District. In the face of a president and Republican-led Senate who blatantly ignore and discount the existential threat posed by climate change, the youth plaintiffs are working to bring our nation one step closer to achieving a legal foundation and requirement to solve this crisis. Last year, I was proud to back the youth plaintiffs by filing an amicus curiae brief with the Ninth Circuit Court. The plaintiffs of this lawsuit understand that the existential threat of climate change denies them the kind of future we should all be guaranteed under the Constitution. While the plaintiffs have requested the full Ninth Circuit to review the decision, Congress&nbsp;must&nbsp;take urgent action on climate change. As Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am working on a 21st Century transportation bill that will take dramatic steps to reduce carbon pollution and make significant investments in green technologies. I will continue to push Congress towards bold, transformative action that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, curtail greenhouse gas emissions, and protect our planet for future generations.

Last night, President Trump gave a misleading picture. The reality is that Trump&#8217;s policies are immoral and they hurt women and children in our communities while enriching himself and his friends.  As I escorted President Trump to the House Chamber, I was representing our For the People Agenda, a bold contrast to President Trump, reminding everyone that this country is for them &#8211; no matter where they come from, what their background, or who they love. As President Trump expands his Muslim ban and his officials announce that they will target DREAMers, I am proud that my colleagues and I passed the American Dream and Promise Act and I will fight for us to pass the No BAN Act to put an end to this and future discriminatory travel bans. As a Vice Chair of the Equality Caucus, I am advocating against the attacks on our LGBTQ community and am using my new position on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold this Administration accountable. President Trump touts a growing economy, but his policies are failing hard-working American families while enriching himself and his friends.&nbsp;And under Attorney General Barr, the Department of Justice is fighting in court to repeal the ACA, taking away healthcare from thousands of New Mexicans.&nbsp;President Trump has even announced he plans to cut Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp;  Families in New Mexico and across the country know that this Administration's policies are working for the wealthy and well-connected, while hurting hardworking families. Almost 50,000 New Mexicans in our district rely on SNAP to feed their families, but are now threatened by rule changes that will take food away from hundreds of thousands of people across the country. As someone who had to rely on SNAP at times to keep food on the table, I know how important these programs are to our community. I will work with my colleagues to fight on behalf of every day New Mexicans, not just the wealthy.  While President Trump claims to make us safer, he has disarmed us in our fight against climate change, which remains our greatest national security threat. I am proud to have voted for and passed the Climate Action Now Act, a bill aligning us the Paris Climate Accords and restoring our position leading the world in this fight. The House of Representatives also passed the Scientific Integrity Act to ensure all decisions made by the federal government follow sound science instead of the whims of lobbyists. As the Vice Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, I will continue to hold up New Mexico&#8217;s commitment to a renewable energy revolution as an example for the rest of the country.  The President tried to claim credit for improving our national security, but instead he nearly dragged us into an unnecessary war and stole money from vital projects for his misguided border wall. New Mexicans have a proud history of heeding the call to service and deserve leadership that works for them, not uses them as props. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was able to get housing protections for our military families, which will help all of our serving families living on Kirtland Air Force Base, as well as provisions to start the PFAS cleanup on Kirtland.  Lastly, my membership on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the U.S. puts me in a position to hold the federal government to its trust responsibility to provide for healthcare, public safety, housing, and infrastructure programs. As part of this effort, I will continue to be a tireless advocate for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women so we can give a voice to this silent crisis and enact concrete solutions to address it. We do have things to be proud of over this past year, there have been victories and improvements for every day Americans due to the House of Representatives. I believe our best days are ahead of us and we don't have to accept President Trump's policies that enrich the wealthy instead of our future.

He outlined the Great American Comeback story that he and his Administration have led. During the speech, he laid out an optimistic vision about how we can continue this progress and build a better future for all. Continuing reading to see my full statement on the State of the Union speech. Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump on the partisan articles of impeachment sent to them by House Democrats. Congress has been tied up for months with the House Democrats impeachment obsession. Partisan politics need to be put aside. It&#8217;s long past time to put this impeachment charade behind us and get back to work for the American people.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   State of the Union President Trump continues to put America first and advance the interests of our nation. The strong economy under this administration is lifting Americans everywhere. This administration successfully negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which created 176,000 new jobs, added $68 billion in new economic growth and was a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses. He also delivered on a historic &#8220;Phase One&#8221; trade agreement with China. I was happy to hear the President speak on the jobs created in the opportunity zones established in the Republican tax cut bill. In Georgia, 260 opportunity zones have attracted investments &#8211; including in Muscogee County &#8211; and brought new economic opportunities to our local community. This administration has made tremendous progress in fixing our broken immigration system and securing our border. I was pleased to hear the President&#8217;s plans to continue building a safe and legal immigration system by facing head-on the public safety threat posed by sanctuary cities. The President&#8217;s remarks on issues facing working families, from ensuring that every child can get a great education, to supporting America&#8217;s parents as they manage the demands of their careers while raising children were also commendable. While the Democrats continue to embrace socialist healthcare policies, the President thoughtfully laid out his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs while maintaining the highest standard of care and access to the most innovative cures. President Trump has kept his promises and America is strong once again. As he made clear in his remarks, there are many opportunities for Congress to help Americans and keep our nation moving forward. I remain committed to working with President Trump, his administration and my colleagues in Congress to continue to grow our 21st century economy and create an environment that ensures opportunity for all.  &nbsp;   Mobile Office Hours Members of my staff will be in Fayetteville and Hamilton on Wednesday, February 12th to meet with constituents and assist anyone experiencing a problem with a federal agency.   &nbsp;  Telephone Town Hall I'm excited to announce I will be hosting my next&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;town&nbsp;hall on February 11th starting at 6:30PM.

Updates from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  On Friday, January 31st, HHS Secretary Alex&nbsp;M. Azar II declared a national public health emergency to aid the country&#8217;s healthcare community in responding to 2019 novel&nbsp;coronavirus&nbsp;(2019-nCoV).&nbsp;American health officials have emphasized that while the virus is a serious public health threat, the risk to the American public remains low at this time. Practicing caution when feeling sick and regularly washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water are still the best recommendations for staying healthy.  Updates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  Federal and local health authorities are monitoring people who have displayed symptoms and have a travel history that puts them at risk. The vast majority of these people have tested negative: In the U.S., there are 11 confirmed cases, 167 people who have a negative test, and two confirmed cases of person-to-person spread.  While person-to-person spread among close contacts has been detected, at this time the virus is NOT currently spreading in the United States. The CDC is still studying the virus to determine how contagious it is. Both cases of person-to-person spread of the virus were between very close contacts, such as family members. &nbsp; U.S. health officials are seeking emergency approval to roll out a test for the coronavirus that can be used by hospitals and state health authorities, instead of having samples shipped to the CDC for analysis.&nbsp;The agency is preparing for scenarios in which the virus spreads widely, although the current risk to the American public remains low. The goal of the ongoing U.S. public health response is to prevent sustained spread of coronavirus in this country.  Updates from the State Department  The State Department has raised their Travel Advisory for China to Level 4: Do Not Travel.&nbsp;Those currently in China should attempt to depart by commercial means. Travelers should be prepared for the possibility of travel restrictions with little or no advance notice. Most commercial air carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China. All flights from China to the United States have been redirected to eleven airports throughout the country, including Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport.  Under the temporary emergency measure, U.S. citizens who have been in Hubei province during the past two weeks will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. Citizens returning from elsewhere in China will be subject to screening and self-quarantine for two weeks while being monitored. Foreign nationals, excluding&nbsp;immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, will be denied entry into the U.S if they have been in China in the past 14 days.  Below is a list of Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts from the CDC:  What You Should Do   Avoid close contact with sick people. While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.&nbsp; Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% alcohol. If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China or were in close contact with someone with coronavirus in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor&#8217;s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.  What You Should Not Do   Do not travel to China. Do not use facemasks. CDC does not recommend the use of facemasks for the&nbsp;general public&nbsp;to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Do not show prejudice to people of Asian descent, because of fear of this new virus. Do not assume that someone of Asian descent is more likely to have coronavirus.  Further Information&nbsp;  Experts have been working hard to understand this new strain of coronavirus. Because new information is coming out every day, please visit the sites below to stay up to date.&nbsp; The CDC&nbsp;provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals.&nbsp; Los Angeles County&nbsp;provides updates on the disease's spread within the County, as well as frequently asked questions for Emergency Responders, and for the public available in&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Spanish,&nbsp;Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. &nbsp;provides a list of travel advisories for those who are planning to fly outside of the United States. The health and safety of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call my Pasadena office at (626) 304-0110.

I&#8217;m bringing Karen Battaglia, a nurse from Antioch as my official guest to the President&#8217;s State of the Union address!&nbsp;  Karen has spent most of her career working to improve the health and lives of thousands of people in our community. She is the Trauma Coordinator for Emergency Services at Northwestern Medicine McHenry, where along with her work to save lives, she is working to improve community safety. Throughout her time at Northwestern, Karen has coordinated community programs like SAFE Kids, poison prevention workshops, and community bicycle helmet fittings for children.  Karen also has asthma. For Karen and so many other Illinoisans living with preexisting condition (including me!), the State of the Union comes at a crucial time.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m so honored that when President Trump looks our way during the State of the Union, he&#8217;ll see not one, but TWO nurses with preexisting conditions who are fiercely fighting for their community.&nbsp;  The risk of losing protections for people with preexisting conditions is real, and it&#8217;s terrifying for so many. Republicans and this Administration have worked themselves breathless trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and throw our health care system in chaos. They failed in Congress, and now they&#8217;re pushing in the courts.&nbsp;  As a trauma nurse for over 20 years, Karen knows what&#8217;s at stake. She has seen how much access to quality, affordable healthcare has improved the lives of her patients. She&#8217;s also lived it, and knows how hard it would be for people like her and her grandsons with preexisting conditions to get care if crucial protections are stripped away.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m working every day to protect health care for Illinoisans, and Karen is exactly why. I am so honored to have her join me, and I&#8217;d be honored if you followed along!

I have been hard at work and wanted to update you on my work, both in Washington, DC and back home in Houston.  During the December and January District Work Periods, I was in Washington fulfilling my constitutional duty as part of the ongoing impeachment process against President Donald&nbsp;Trump. In December, we held&nbsp;numerous hearings in the House Judiciary Committee leading up to the impeachment of the President for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.   On January 15th, I was named one of the seven impeachment managers tasked with presenting the people&#8217;s case for removing the President from office before the U.S. Senate and the American people.  Despite having to spend more time in DC because of impeachment, my team and I have participated in many events across the Texas 29th Congressional District, including: Co-Sponsoring a Townhall Action Meeting on Cancer Clusters with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,&nbsp;participating in&nbsp;various School Board Appreciation Month Celebrations, and attending a community breakfast hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). To learn more about my work, be sure to follow me @RepSylviaGarcia on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  Now You Know: The 2020 Census  April 1st is Census Day 2020!    By April 1st, every home should have received an invitation to participate in the 2020 Census, and it will be celebrated with events across the country. When completing the census, you will have three options for responding: online, by phone or by mail. Be sure to include everyone living in your home!&nbsp;  The U.S. Census Bureau is recruiting to fill hundreds of thousands of temporary positions across the country to assist with the 2020 Census count. Follow the link to apply: 2020 Census Jobs.  If you have additional questions a list of FAQs can be found here: Census FAQs.  Legislative Update:  House Democrats and I have been hard at work on behalf of the people of America. Below you can read my legislative update on work taking place on the Judiciary Committee and Financial Services Committees, the two committees that I have the honor of serving on.  Major&nbsp;updates from the House Judiciary Committee:  H.R. 5645: Eyes on the Courts Act of 2020 On January 16th, 2019, Chairman Nadler along with other bipartisan members reintroduced the &#8220;Eyes on the Courts Act.&#8220; This legislation will require cameras be permitted in the Supreme Court and all federal appellate courts. This legislation would provide transparency and allow Americans to have access to court proceedings.  Remain In Mexico Policy Investigation On January 14th, 2019, the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, including myself, launched an investigation into how the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; immigration policy has morphed into a policy where refugees and asylum seekers are being kept in Mexico indefinitely without due process or access to counsel. This investigation will help to ensure the health and safety of asylum seekers at the border.  Major&nbsp;updates from the Financial Services Committee:  H.R. 4302: Homeless Assistance Act of 2019 This bill would allow public housing agencies to share data with local governments and nonprofit service providers, which will help them better identify people who experience homelessness and who need to use multiple services. I supported this bill because I believe it is critical that our social service providers are able to effectively connect residents with resources&nbsp;  H.R. 5315: Expanding Opportunities for MDIs Act This bill would strengthen a U.S. Department of Treasury program to encourage collaboration between Minority Depository Institutions (MDI&#8217;s) and large financial institutions. I am a proud supporter of this bill, as I strongly believe in supporting American small business, especially those that are women and minority-owned.  H.R. 2398: Veteran HOUSE Act of 2020 This bill would expand the eligibility for the Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program to veterans experiencing homelessness who have received an other-than-honorable (but not dishonorable) discharge. Supporting our veterans is important to me, and the passage of this bill is one step closer to providing supportive case management and access to resources for those who need it most.&nbsp;  Other major bills in the House of Representatives:  H.R.&nbsp; 3:&nbsp; Lower Drug Costs Now Act This bill would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug manufacturers for lower prices. Insulin is one of the first drugs the secretary must negotiate, and the lower prices will be available to Medicare beneficiaries and those with private insurance. This is an issue that is particularly close to my heart, since seven of my nine&nbsp;siblings are diabetic. This a critical step forward in the fight for affordable healthcare, and it is especially important here in our district where 30% of our district is uninsured according to the US Census Bureau. War Powers Resolution On January 9, 2020, the House of Representatives voted to approve a resolution aimed at restraining the President's ability to use military action against Iran without congressional approval. The resolution states that &#8220; the United States military force, American people and members of the United States Armed Forces deserve a credible explanation regarding the use of military force.&#8221;  Notable News:        Texas Tribune: Garcia got to Congress, and landed in&nbsp;this impeachment role, through quiet competence, resilience amid the rough and tumble nature of Harris County politics&nbsp;and an ability to develop key relationships with friends and rivals alike, according to interviews with over a dozen Texas Democrats.      In District Event Highlights:    Houston Chronicle:&nbsp;Consumer advocate Erin Brockovich to speak on cancer cluster in Fifth Ward at town hall. The town hall, hosted by Jackson Lee and U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Houston), will focus on relief for the community affected by the contamination. Federal, state, county and city representatives, as well as legal experts and environmental and health advocates, are expected to attend. Union Pacific said in a statement that the company will also have a representative present. Concluding Message:  Thank you for taking the time to keep up with the work I&#8217;m doing on your behalf.

In Brooklyn, more intense heat-waves and storms due to climate change are a serious threat to our local power grid, triggering blackouts in many recent years. In the face of this challenge it is imperative that we take steps to protect our communities and make our power sector smarter and more resilient.  Wednesday, January 29, 2020  Subcommittee&nbsp;on Communications and Technology Hearing on Empowering and Connecting Communities through Digital Equity and Internet Adoption   The American people deserve access to broadband devices, the internet and affordable services. Congressman McNerney, Lujan and I recently introduced H.R. 4486, the Digital Equity Act to ensure every person is provided access to the digital literacy they deserve in 2020 and beyond. Information is power and someone&#8217;s income level or neighborhood should have zero impact on their access to broadband internet.  Friday, January 31, 2020&nbsp;  America&#8217;s Bigot-in-Chief has struck again&#8212;this time limiting the rights and banning immigration from certain African countries. President Trump&#8217;s announcement of an African Ban further perpetuates his racist, xenophoic agenda to whitewash America. See tweet here.    IN THE DISTRICT:  &nbsp;  Small businesses are one of the many pillars that make New York&#8217;s 9th Congressional District so unique. Last week's town hall on small businesses was an opportunity that provided information and resources for small businesses in Brooklyn. See tweet here.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nothing is better than supporting tomorrow's leaders. I had the pleasure of meeting Brooklyn's Success Academy Students, 100% of whom passed the 2019 NYS math &amp; ELA exam. Congratulations! See post here.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It was a pleasure meeting IGNITE's Young Women at the Women in Politics lunch. It is important that we integrate more women in government, create more inclusion and develop a stronger pipeline of future women in politics.

See tweet&nbsp;here.    &#8234;Shirley Chisholm first ran for Congress in 1968, and won, going on to serve seven terms as a US Representative.&#8236; As the 1st Black woman to be elected to a Congressional seat, she fiercely advocated for social justice and minority education opportunities. See post here.&nbsp;    Unbought and unbossed (her famous catch phrase), Shirley Chisholm leaves behind a rich legacy, and inspires me every day to work tirelessly as an advocate for our community. Today, and every day, we celebrate the queen, Shirley Chisholm. See tweet&nbsp;here.    Spike Lee is a staple of Brooklyn&#8217;s pop culture, and an icon known across the country. One of my favorite Spike Lee joints, Do the Right Thing, debuted in 1989 and is an incredible portrait of Brooklyn&nbsp;and the values important to our borough.

I hope you enjoyed the big game yesterday. It was an exciting game (and, as a Seahawks fan, I was happy to see the Niners lose). My favorite parts? The Groundhog Day commercial... and the food! I ate far too many chips, far too much dip, and way too many chicken wings. Actually, it was a pretty fun game (and my daughters have convinced me to become a fan of The Masked Singer). Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be heading back to DC, and the first order of business is the State of the Union address. I was asked by someone after my town hall this Saturday what I hoped to hear from President Trump on Tuesday night. There are a lot of differences between the resident&#8217;s priorities and mine. Having said that, most of the folks I represent want the President to work with Democrats and Republicans to solve some problems. In his address, I hope the President outlines some areas where he believes he can work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people. In fact, this morning, I joined a number of my colleagues in asking that President Trump address areas where the American people want folks in D.C. to find common ground and make progress, including:   Improving access to quality, affordable health care. Unfortunately, the Administration has taken steps that have increased premiums and increased the number of uninsured Americans. There are opportunities to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and fix elements of our healthcare system that need fixing. That should be a priority that both parties can get behind.&nbsp; Following through on a commitment to rebuild America&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure. It&#8217;s hard for America to compete in a 21st Century economy with 19th Century infrastructure. There aren&#8217;t Democratic roads or Republican bridges, so this ought to be an area where the two parties and collaborate. Prioritizing a future that works for all Americans. In the midst of disruptive economic change, it&#8217;s important to ensure that American workers are empowered to navigate those changes rather than be victimized by them. Investments in education and training, efforts to increase wages, and strengthening protections for workers can ensure that more people in more places have economic opportunity. Restoring America&#8217;s role in the world. It&#8217;s time to reengage constructively with our allies and restore our role as a leader. That can improve America&#8217;s security and economy.&nbsp; Taking action to build long-lasting solutions to reduce carbon emissions. The clean energy sector will be a core driver of economic growth and job creation. There are a number of common-sense, bipartisan proposals that would represent concrete action to curb carb emissions, spur economic growth and create jobs.  I feel so strongly about the need to make progress on that last priority, I&#8217;m bringing a special guest to the State of the Union: Kitsap County resident Mike Kelly. Mike, a small businessowner who lives with his family on Bainbridge Island, is the Congressional District Liaison in our region for Citizens&#8217; Climate Lobby, a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on policies to combat climate change. I&#8217;ve been working actively to see the United States take action to step up to the climate crisis. Thankfully, I&#8217;m not alone. In fact, folks across our region and across the country are stepping up to raise awareness about the need to act. Mike Kelly, local organizers, and the team at Citizens Climate Lobby are helping to lead the way. I&#8217;m proud to have Mike attend the State of the Union to continue the call for the President to listen to the American people who are not just demanding action - but leadership - to combat climate change and its impacts. We know that if we do this right, we can not only help our planet - we can create quality jobs and sustainable economic growth. You can read all about what Mike&#8217;s attendance means to him in the Kitsap Sun.  There are plenty of policy differences between me and this Administration, but in an era of divided government, progress requires collaboration. I hope we hear that commitment to working together from him tomorrow, too. Now, on to the news&#8230; Taking Action to Keep America Safe  In recent weeks, there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion about rising tensions between the United States and Iran. As I&#8217;ve traveled across our region, I&#8217;ve heard from folks who are deeply concerned about this escalation - and I share those concerns. Ultimately, the American people do not want - and Congress has not authorized - another war in the Middle East. Our servicemembers and diplomats who serve there, including the ones I visited in Iraq this past November, deserve a strategy that keeps them safe, enhances our security, and fosters long term stability in the region.  Last week, Congress passed two bills I co-sponsored to reclaim the Constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and authorize the use of military force, an authority that has eroded over the last two decades. You can hear more about that here:    Ensuring Future Generations Never Forget  Every year on Holocaust Memorial Day, we honor the millions of innocent people who lost their lives. Families across the world have their own stories of this dark chapter in our world&#8217;s history.  This year on Holocaust Memorial Day, which coincided this year with the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the House passed the &#8220;Never Again Education Act&#8221; - bipartisan legislation I supported to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America so future generations can continue to learn these stories. This bill will provide fundamental resources, education, and training for teachers and students across the country to ensure we continue to educate our communities and future generations on the lessons of the Holocaust - and ultimately promote the importance of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people.  Continuing the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic  Across our country, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have been one of the leading causes of drug overdoses and fatalities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 41% of the 70,200 drug overdoses in the United States in 2017 were caused by fentanyl and illicit chemical copycats of the drug, which is 100 times more potent than morphine. And in 2018, there were over 30,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths alone. In response, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2018 placed a temporary emergency order to classify all fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 drugs (meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use). This temporary order increased restrictions in terms of access, manufacturing, and use - and has led to the supply of new fentanyl analogues dropping by 75 percent.  Last week, the House took bipartisan action to extend the temporary order on these drugs for 15 more months, overwhelmingly passing the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report within 12 months on the public health and safety effects of controlling fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1. While its only a temporary solution, it&#8217;s a start. I&#8217;m hopeful that Congress will continue to work to develop common-sense, long-term solutions to the opioid crisis.&nbsp;  Working for You  Honoring Our Veterans  Want to be inspired?!? Listen to this story... I recently held a Vietnam Veterans pinning ceremony in Tacoma to say thank you to Vietnam-era vets on behalf of a grateful nation. About halfway through the event, we got a call that a group of veterans was on its way from the Retsil Veterans&#8217; Home in Kitsap County but that they would be an hour late. Having already pinned everyone in attendance, I made an announcement that more vets were on the way, and I asked if folks would be willing to stick around to thank the folks who were coming from Retsil. I was so moved that every single person stuck around. One veteran said to me, &#8220;You know, a lot of us have waited forty or fifty years to get thanked. I can wait a few minutes to honor these folks coming from Retsil.&#8221;&nbsp;  WOW! It was a real testament to the awesome character of our community - and of the veterans who have served our country. I&#8217;m grateful for everyone that came out for this special event.   Celebrating Team Kitsap  The economic forecast for Kitsap County is bright thanks to the presence of the incredible employers, innovative educational partners, and the economic development A-Team that is the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance. It was great to join them to talk about opportunities for the future. Count me as a proud member of Team Kitsap!    Supporting Washington&#8217;s Ocean Economy  I&#8217;m committed to supporting Washington&#8217;s ocean economy. I enjoyed the opportunity to be in Grays Harbor to hear from members of the fishing community and discuss a new bill I introduced to improve the federal fishery disaster process and ensure more timely disaster relief for impacted communities. I&#8217;m also working as a member of the Appropriations Committee to restore our salmon populations.    Helping Our Seniors  Seniors today are facing unique challenges. That&#8217;s why I was grateful for the opportunity to hold a seniors town hall at the Willows Retirement Living in Bremerton to hear from folks and to talk about the work I&#8217;m doing to ensure Congress protects Medicare &amp; Social Security, lowers the cost of prescription drug prices, and keeps our nation&#8217;s promise to take care of older Americans.    Hearing from You at Town Halls  Speaking of town halls... I held a town hall in Suquamish on Saturday where we talked about opportunities to reduce student debt and ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.&nbsp;  Couldn&#8217;t come? Join me February 10th at 5:30pm PT for a Facebook Live Town Hall. It&#8217;s always important for me to be available, accessible, and accountable to you.  OK - that&#8217;s it for now folks. As always, I&#8217;m honored to represent you.

I&#8217;ve been working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues in Congress to get more answers from the Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the State Department. Our public health is my top priority.&nbsp; My office and I are ready to help those who have loved ones that are stuck in China. We recently helped a California 39th resident get connected with our U.S. embassies, who are coordinating evacuations for U.S. citizens, and ensure they get the proper health and safety check-ups once they are back in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms  The coronavirus can be spread directly between humans. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. If you have visited China within the past two weeks and start to feel ill, call your doctor immediately.&nbsp; Prevention&nbsp;  There is currently no vaccine to fight this strain of coronavirus. However, below are steps recommended by the CDC that you can take to keep you and your loved ones safe and healthy:   Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wear a face mask. It is currently flu season, so please get your flu vaccine if you haven't already.   Travel Warnings  The State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory warning people to avoid traveling to China. The China Travel Advisory can be found here.&nbsp; If you are still planning to travel to China, I encourage you to enroll in the State Department&#8217;s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive important messages, alerts, updates, and travel advisories while you are there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Information  Experts have been working hard to understand this new strain of coronavirus. Because new information surfaces every day, please visit the sites below to stay up to date.&nbsp; The Center for Disease Control and Prevention provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals.&nbsp; The State Department provides a list of travel advisories for those who are planning to fly outside of the United States. The safety and health of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance.  Please feel free to share this email with your friends and family. Stay in touch by following me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, my handle is @RepGilCisneros.  I am humbled to serve you in Congress.&nbsp;  Take care,   Gilbert R.

This marks the 10th bill I have authored to be signed into law since January of 2019. I will continue working across the aisle to get things done for the people I serve.&nbsp; Please continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf last week. &nbsp;  Putting an End to Robocalls  This article highlights a recent crackdown on robocallers.&nbsp; It is great to see that these bad actors facilitating robocalls are finally being held accountable. I anticipate that we will see more of this type of aggressive action in the coming months as the new legislation we just passed to stop robocalls gets fully implemented.&nbsp;   Supporting Economic Development  Last week, President Trump signed the USMCA into law. This improved trade deal protects American workers and will create almost 200,000 new jobs.   It is also exciting to see this project moving forward. It will be among the many things that continue to make Pasco a great place to live, work and play!  Raising Awareness  Last&nbsp; week we had a Florida Delegation meeting to discuss human trafficking and further steps that we can take at the federal level to combat the problem. With the Super Bowl coming to Tampa next year, I was encouraged to learn more about the work currently being done in Miami to prevent the spike in human trafficking that typically accompanies these high profile events.   Visit the National Human Trafficking Prevention Hotline's website to learn more about resources available for victims. Together we can help stop this terrible crime.  Last week, we recognized International Holocaust Remembrance Day.&nbsp; We remember the millions of lives lost at the hands of the Nazi regime and the atrocities that can occur when intolerance, hatred and bigotry are accepted. We must never allow this to happen again. On this 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, we mourn those who were tortured, abused or killed there, and we give thanks to the heroes who risked their lives to help liberate the camp. I am saddened that 75 years later we are still fighting a rise in anti-Semitic behavior, language and beliefs. There is simply no place for this type of ignorance in our society. As co-chair of the International Religious Freedom Caucus, I am resolute in my commitment to support freedom of religion and expression around the globe. #WeRemember   Addressing Public Health Issues  Last week, I attended a bipartisan briefing on the Coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) gave us a rundown of current efforts to contain the outbreak in China, as well as, the current attempts to develop a vaccine. The most important message from the CDC is that we all need to remain calm. The CDC is confident that it is taking necessary precautions to protect Americans.&nbsp; Dr. Robert Redfield from the CDC said, &#8220;If you are experiencing respiratory issues, and have not been to China, it is incredibly unlikely that you have contracted the virus. However, if you have flu-like symptoms, it is a good idea to go see your healthcare provider.&#8221;  &nbsp;   In last week's Health Subcommittee hearing we also examined safety concerns associated with counterfeit medications and products sold through e-commerce businesses. Click here to listen to my exchange with the panelists.  Advocating for our Heroes  During last week's VA Hearing we discussed the steps being taken to identify Veterans who may be in need of mental health services during their transition to civilian life. Click here to listen to my exchange with VA officials.  We also have to change our approach for how we handle suicide prevention in the Veteran community. For too long, too many of our heroes have died. I applaud the Senate for advancing critical legislation which requires a new strategy and urge my House colleagues to take up the measure when the bill comes over from the Senate.  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received this email from a constituent in Palm Harbor.&nbsp;  Representative Bilirakis,  On behalf of my wife and I we would like to thank you and your staff for a wonderful and memorable trip to our nations capital.&nbsp; Kathy and I celebrated our 43rd wedding anniversary with a lifelong dream come true.&nbsp; Your amazing staff made us feel so welcome and the young interns that led us on our tour of the capital could not have been any nicer and informative.&nbsp; Words alone just won&#8217;t do justice or how terrific we were treated.&nbsp; The trip was everything we had hoped for and more.&nbsp; The White House was beyond our wildest expectations.&nbsp; It was so wonderful to see our nations history up close. I am a Navy veteran and the pride in my country was so great to feel.&nbsp; How lucky we are to live in this great country, even with our warts there is nothing in mankind&#8217;s history to rival our great nation. &nbsp;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. In addition to offering tours and helping to make constituents' trips to D.C. special, I have a team of caseworkers available to assist any constituent in need.&nbsp; Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team was proud to participate in the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce's Business Development Week Kick-Off Luncheon. The stories shared were inspirational and it is always great to see so many professionals willing to learn from one another and help each other succeed.   My team enjoyed the opportunity to participate in last week's meeting of the Suncoast Chapter of Military Officers Association. In addition to providing a brief legislative update, we were able to answer questions about the new VA Clinic on Little Road.  My team enjoyed participating in the Grand Opening of Esthetics 813 in Wesley Chapel. It is always good to see new businesses moving the area. Welcome to the community!   It was bittersweet for my team to participate in the Celebration of Life for Ms. Karen Collins, a long-time VA employee at James A. Haley Veterans Hospital. Karen was a tireless and dedicated employee. Her sudden passing left us all in shock. As a Public Affairs Officer, Karen was a critical point of contact for my team for many years. She was a tremendous asset as we endeavored to help Veterans experiencing hardship. She will be sorely missed.  My team also volunteered to help with the Homeless Point in Time Count in Pasco. This one-day snap shot of the number of homeless persons in a community occurs throughout the country. The number of persons counted on that day is used to determine how much federal and state funding each county will receive to combat homelessness. We want to make sure each county has accurate results. A special thank you to all the volunteers who participated throughout Tampa Bay to ensure that our community receives its share of the resources needed to help those in need.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act (), the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act (), the Never Again Education Act (), the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act (), the Global Hope Act (), a Resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests (), the Keeping Girls in School Act (), the Tibetan Policy Support Act (), the Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act (), the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act (), an Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the No War With Iran Act (), and an additional Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the Repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF ().  It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!&nbsp; This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month. David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead. They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation. Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .            Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico &#8211; two of Arkansas&#8217;s top trading partners. The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity.  For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs.  The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this week&#8217;s signing delivers a 21st&nbsp;century trade framework. This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural State&#8217;s world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansas&#8217;s hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families. Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansas&#8217;s exports. A&nbsp;&nbsp;from the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million. Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand. It&#8217;s exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December. By negotiating from strength &#8211; the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy. This landmark agreement puts America first! I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line. Promises made, promises kept! The President also announced his . The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people. With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East. No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone &#8211; and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation. On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future. Centuries of hostilities won&#8217;t be solved overnight &#8211; but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path. I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region.  It&#8217;s noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda. While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America. The results speak for themselves &#8211; thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created. &nbsp;In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations. We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory. Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year. On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic.  It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion. Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030. Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window. Our country&#8217;s unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt. Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030. To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget. We&#8217;ve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously. Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt. The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.  It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them. Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions &#8211; which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country. Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesn&#8217;t appear that we&#8217;ll have one this year either. In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year. Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget.  It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face. We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people. Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies. I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith &#8211; who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association &#8211; to discuss the Community Development Block Grant program&nbsp;and other initiatives that support housing and community development.  The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators. It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the University&#8217;s priorities. I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas. I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas. They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development. I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell &#8211; and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District.  My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.&nbsp;We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare.  I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year. The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief. While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House. The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence. Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient.  Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith. The funding &#8211; awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA) &#8211; will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD). These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.  Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District. This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation. By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities. Learn more .

Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, it&#8217;s easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t make progress by standing on the sidelines.&#8221; After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, we&#8217;re not surrendering. In fact, just the opposite: We&#8217;re fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect. It&#8217;s an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives. Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community. I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities. Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you. Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke     &nbsp;    Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents. Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve. Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market. These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home. In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments. The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers. Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings. I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act. This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex. My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes. New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.  &nbsp;     In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the President&#8217;s anti-immigrant agenda. My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R. 6) passed in the House of Representatives last year. According to H.R. 6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America. Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge.   Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the President&#8217;s xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, I&#8217;m committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census. It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community. We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive. Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts. Every person counts.        Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States. I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people. As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests.        Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities. Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R. 4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R. 4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on America&#8217;s national security.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residents&#8212;many in the Ninth District&#8212;were left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared. I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesn&#8217;t happen again. Brooklyn&#8217;s communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century. To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn. With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities. As a firm believer in Congress&#8217; ability to come together and combat this nation&#8217;s contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation.     I am proud that my bill H.R. 5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as &#8220;the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn.&#8221; My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy. Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007. At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing. Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all. In Major Owens&#8217; honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives.        My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell. This inaction is unacceptable. The fact is: background checks save lives. Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns. Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R. 1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm. From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence.        I&#8217;m proud that my bill, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act,&#8221; passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls. If you&#8217;ve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers. These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills. I know robocalls are more than annoying&#8212;they&#8217;re costly. My legislation, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act.&#8221; will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.        Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you. Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents. That&#8217;s why I take every opportunity to celebrate the community, whether it&#8217;s dancing with my friends and constituents at the yearly West Indian Day Parade or eating food from local restaurants and vendors at street fairs, such as the Park Slope 5th Avenue Street Fair.

Take a look at the article below and let me know if you support my efforts to combat this growing problem in Florida and across the country.  Vern    Congressional delegation to tackle spike in Florida human trafficking Jacob Ogles  In one ranking no one will brag about, Florida ranks third in the nation for reported human trafficking cases. As Florida&#8217;s Congressional Delegation met for the first time in 2020, the topic drove the agenda.  &#8220;Human trafficking is a vile crime against children and women that flourishes in the dark shadows of society,&#8221; said Rep. Vern Buchanan, Delegation co-chair. &#8220;We need to bring it into the light, expose these atrocities and end what amounts to modern-day slavery.&#8221;  Executives from Sarasota-based Selah Freedom flew to Washington to press for action. Elizabeth Fisher Good, the organization&#8217;s founder, testified that early education must be part of any effort to reduce human trafficking.  She said there must also be an awareness of online activity, a ubiquitous part of the modern teenage experience.  &#8220;1 out of 9 children are now approached on social media,&#8221; Fisher Good said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t stranger danger anymore. That&#8217;s why education starting in kindergarten is vital.&#8221;  Congress members also heard from Dr. Heidi Schaeffer, a member of the Broward Human Trafficking Coalition, who traveled to Washington, D.C. &#8220;to increase awareness of this issue to as many healthcare professionals as possible &#8211; plus to the general public.&#8221;  Rep. Alcee Hastings, Florida&#8217;s other Delegation co-chair, has been working with Buchanan&#8217;s office on bipartisan legislation. The Boca Raton Democrat and Sarasota Republican introduced the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Prevention Training Act of 2019 (HR 4388) in September. Eight of the bill&#8217;s 19 co-sponsors represent Florida districts.  &#8220;Human trafficking victims suffer unspeakable acts of violence and exploitation,&#8221; Buchanan said. &#8220;This bill will address the problem in our home state and across the country. Congress needs to move swiftly and get this measure to the President&#8217;s desk.&#8221;  Thirteen of Florida&#8217;s 27 Congress members attended the Delegation meeting.  There, they heard from national experts on the growing crime.  &#8220;When we launched the war on drugs, everyone knew there was a war on drugs,&#8221; said Roger DeHart, founder of the group First S.T.O.P. (Saving Teens And Others From Predators).  &#8220;If we took that same approach with human trafficking, we might have more of an impact.&#8221;            &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

While I had two cataract surgeries and wasn&#8217;t able to do as much as I would have liked, I still had the opportunity to attend many events in the community and meet with several leaders. As always, these exchanges helped me to prepare for my return to DC this week, armed with the knowledge of how I can best serve you and meet the needs of our community. Continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf.  Fighting for our Heroes  Last weekend, I had the honor and privilege of presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to deserving Filipino WWII Veterans who served our nation honorably and have not been treated appropriately by our government. When they agreed to fight under the direction of our military, they did so with President Roosevelt's guarantee that they would be treated as members of the U.S. military and would earn the same benefits as any other servicemember. However, after the war a subsequent U.S. President rescinded that promise. It wasn't until 2009 when Congress authorized a lump sum payment to these Veterans; however, many are still fighting for the care and benefits they deserve. While it was truly an honor to recognize their service and sacrifice, this situation remains a terrible injustice. I will continue to fight on their behalf.   I also had the privilege of providing a brief legislative update to the Veterans' Club at Heritage Springs. I thank these heroes for their service to our nation and appreciate their willingness to share their thoughts with me about how we can ensure Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve. It was a wonderful morning!   This alarming report is just one more reason that we need to keep investing in the critical research needed to find better treatments and a cure for ALS. We must determine why Veterans are contracting ALS at a higher rate than non-Veterans and we must keep fighting for a cure for all patients who suffer with this catastrophic illness.&nbsp;  Additionally, I agree with the author of this article that suicide rates among the Veteran community are still unacceptable. We have to do more to support our heroes when they return from combat. Part of the solution is in providing alternative and complementary treatments, and we are doing that through the implementation of the COVER Act. However, we must do more to engage community stakeholders, which is why I am pushing for passage of the IMPROVE Act. This is a model that has proven successful in tackling other issues, and I believe it will help save the lives of our nation&#8217;s heroes.&nbsp; Preventing Homelessness  As I have said many times, fighting homelessness is a mission that is near and dear to my heart. Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Homeless Empowerment Program (HEP) in Clearwater. In addition to offering short and long-term housing options, HEP provides the wrap-around services needed to help clients attain stability. This includes: healthcare, mental health and substance use treatment, the chance to participate in community gardening, after school and summer camp initiatives for homeless children and financial literacy programs. They also have specially-designed programs to assist homeless Veterans. I look forward to working more closely with HEP and other providers as they continue their efforts to end homelessness in our community.   Improving Healthcare Outcomes  Last week, I met with Ms. Elodie Dorso the CEO of Community Health Centers of Pinellas and Edward Kucher, the Chief Operating Officer. We discussed the exciting and innovative ways they are partnering with stakeholders to provide dental care, primary care and mental health/substance use treatment to residents of Pinellas and Pasco counties. In the past year, they have served 58,300 patients on a sliding fee scale basis. As a long-time supporter of the community health center model, I was eager to receive an update about the new dental clinic being built at the Tarpon Springs location. They continue to work collaboratively to meet an urgent need in our community!  &nbsp;   Combatting Human Trafficking  This report highlights some staggering statistics: -More than 1/5th of human trafficking victims are children (btw. ages of 12-14)-The life expectancy for a victim after being taken is seven years-83% of human trafficking victims in our country are U.S. citizens-Florida's rate of human trafficking continues to climb These are just a of few of the many reasons that I continue to work on this tragic issue. I've helped fund grants like the one just received in Tampa Bay to help form regional coalitions of stakeholders who work together to end human trafficking. We are also working at the federal level to strengthen protections for victims, raise awareness and end the facilitation of this horrific crime. Together we can make a difference. Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent in Hudson.   &#8220;Dear Congressman, I have had a wonderful experience with your office here in New Port Richey! James and your staff made my situation, \"being declared deceased\" by Social Security , seem so much better than I expected! As I explained to James, EVERYTHING in my name was frozen, deleted, or, just untouchable, thanks to something Social Security did to me. Your staff was more than accommodating, and I am truly appreciative in all of the hard work and dedication they put forth! You should be very proud of your staff, and my wife and I are truly thankful!!&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team enjoyed participating in last week's Grand Opening of the Tarpon Springs Distillery. It is great to see new businesses thriving. Welcome to the community, Barry and Lisa Butler!  &nbsp;   My team listened to Mark Gold, President of Mishorim USA and the new owner of The Grove in Wesley Chapel during this week's North Tampa Chamber's Economic Development luncheon.&nbsp; Mr. Gold discussed his exciting future plans for this property. It is wonderful to hear about the steps being taken to enhance our community.   My team was proud to help welcome the Rohr family to Pasco. They opened a Chicken Salad Chick restaurant in Odessa-the first Pasco location. There is one near my house in Palm Harbor and I regularly enjoy their food. I look forward to eating at the new Pasco location as I travel throughout the district. Welcome to the neighborhood!   My team had the pleasure of spending some time with the members of VFW Post 2550 in Dunedin. While there, my team provided a brief legislative update and received feedback about the newly authorized VA pilot project which will provide Veterans with expanded access to dental care.     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update. Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up!

We toured the campus and discussed the incredible work that is happening in the schools' agriculture and environmental science departments. We also talked about how students are preparing to enter the workforce in emerging industries, including hemp production.&nbsp;  Wednesday morning, I had the pleasure of meeting with young students at Bonner Middle School in Danville. It is always a pleasure to visit 5th District schools and talk to students about what it is like to be in Congress and the work that we are doing for them.  I also had the chance to meet with small business owners in the Danville River District and discuss the important work that&nbsp;is happening to revitalize the area.&nbsp;  Next, I spoke at the Virginia Agricultural Growers Association annual meeting in South Boston. Farming and agriculture are the largest industries in the 5th District, and I will always stand with our farmers. We discussed the United States- Mexico- Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and how hemp can be a&nbsp;transformational crop for Southside.&nbsp;  Afterward, I held a roundtable discussion with Sentara Halifax Regional Hospital. I joined local constituents and healthcare professionals to talk about how we can ensure all Virginia residents have access to quality, affordable care.  It has been a fantastic experience to travel across the 5th District this week. I promise to continue working for you here in our district and in Washington.&nbsp;  If you need help with a federal agency, please contact my Charlottesville Office at (434) 973-9631 or see my staff during our mobile office hours on Tuesdays across the 5th District.

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Recognizing the Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today, we celebrate the life and service of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His actions and words continue to inspire and challenge us to fight for the vulnerable and seek peace with our fellow man.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  USMCA Heads to the President&#8217;s Desk for Signature On Thursday, I voted in favor of approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on the Senate floor. The agreement was approved overwhelmingly in the Senate and will now be sent to the President&#8217;s desk for his signature.&nbsp; Passing USMCA is a major step in implementing this 21st-century trade deal and providing needed certainty for Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers. Over one-third of Kansas exports go to Canada and Mexico making those countries Kansas&#8217; two largest export markets. On Jan. 3, I&nbsp;urged&nbsp;Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to consider USMCA as soon as it passed out of the appropriate Senate committees. I voted Wednesday in both the Senate Appropriations and Commerce Committees to pass USMCA, moving it to the full Senate for a vote. I appreciate Senate leaders&#8217; listening to my request and quickly moving this important trade agreement to a vote on the Senate floor. Over the past two years, I have consistently advocated for a deal like USMCA to be reached. I have heard directly from many Kansas producers on the vital importance of a modern trade deal that expands export opportunities, and I applaud President Trump&#8217;s work to get this trade deal accomplished. To view the timeline of my efforts on a modern trade deal, click&nbsp;here.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Update Regarding the Impeachment TrialAt noon on Thursday, seven House managers delivered and read the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Shortly after 2 p.m., Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was escorted into the Senate chamber and sworn in as the presiding officer. After he was sworn in, Chief Justice Roberts swore in each U.S. Senator and then we individually signed the oath book. The oath represents a pledge to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law. I take this oath and responsibility seriously. The impeachment trial will officially begin on Tuesday, January 21, 2020. The Senate will first set the rules of the trial and then we will move to oral arguments. The trial will be held every day at 1 p.m. ET, Monday through Saturday, until we reach a verdict or dismiss the charges.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Meeting with NASA Astronauts, including Kansan Nick Hague On Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet with NASA Astronauts Anne McClain and Nick Hague. Both recently served as flight engineers on expeditions to the International Space Station. Astronaut Hague is a Kansas native and graduated from Hoxie High School in 1994 before serving in the United States Air Force. During Expedition 59/60, Hague conducted three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 56 minutes with a total of 203 days in space before returning to Earth in October 2019. After he returned to Earth, I took the opportunity to speak with him over the phone to tell him how proud Kansans are of him and how often I get to brag about his accomplishments serving our country. It was great to talk with Astronaut Hague again and as Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee on Appropriations, I enjoyed getting a chance to discuss both of their missions and the resources that are vital to their success.  &nbsp;    At the end of our meeting, Astronaut Hague presented me with a Kansas flag that was flown by him at the International Space Station. I look forward to displaying the Kansas flag in my office and having the opportunity to share this with the many Kansans who visit my office.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Attending the Signing Ceremony for the Phase One China Trade Agreement  On Wednesday, the United States and China signed an historic trade agreement that will open new trade opportunities for farmers and manufacturers across Kansas. I was pleased to join President Trump at the White House for the signing ceremony. This agreement includes a commitment by China to purchase at least $40 billion annually in agricultural products from the United States each of the next two years. This agreement is also a first step in addressing China&#8217;s misbehavior on trade, such as the theft of American intellectual property and forced technology transfer. Congress must work to make certain China lives up to its agreement and hold China accountable if its bad behavior continues. I will continue to urge the administration to reach an agreement with China that removes U.S. tariffs and China&#8217;s retaliatory tariffs that are damaging to Kansas.  &nbsp;  Attending the American Farm Bureau Federation&#8217;s Annual Convention This weekend, I attended the American Farm Bureau Federation&#8217;s Annual Convention to speak with farmers and ranchers from across the United States about making certain rural America has a voice in Congress. An important part of this conversation centered around access to healthcare and broadband, which allows the rural way of life to be sustained. It was also great to discuss the recent vote by the Senate to approve USMCA, ensuring further trade certainty for farmers. I also highlighted my trip to the White House for the signing of Phase One of the China trade agreement by President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He which should be significant for the economic well being of farmers and the U.S. economy.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Town Hall Project Announces 2019 Awards  This past week, Town Hall Project released their end of year report and announced that I held 73 town hall meetings in 2019 &#150; the most town halls of any member of Congress. Each town hall had to meet the criteria of having at least a twenty-four hour notice, being open to the public and feature at least 30 minutes of open Q&amp;A.  &nbsp;  Town halls are a part of my Kansas Listening Tour, a priority throughout my time in Kansas to stay connected to the Kansans I represent. Every Congressional session, I visit each of Kansas&#8217; 105 counties, and the conversations I have help drive the work I do in Washington, D.C. Thank you to each Kansan that I have spoken with during my time in Congress for sharing your thoughts and ideas with me. I look forward to many more Kansas Listening Tour stops in 2020.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Recognized as a 2019 Wheat Advocate  On Thursday, I met with representatives from Kansas Wheat Commission. During the meeting we discussed a variety of issues, including the importance of trade and exports to Kansas farmers, the Federal Grain Inspection Service reauthorization, international food aid and federal funding for wheat research. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, I secured resources for critical wheat research initiatives, including the Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative, which develops control measures for&nbsp;Fusarium&nbsp;head blight, or scab.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was also honored to be presented with the 2019 Wheat Advocate Award from the National Association of Wheat Growers during the meeting. Our wheat growers are critical to the global food&nbsp;supply, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside Kansas Wheat Commission to improve the outlook for agriculture in Kansas.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Announcing the Addition of Two District Representatives  Two new district representatives have joined my team to serve northeast Kansas. Susan Metsker will primarily work on behalf of Kansans to address any concerns or issues they may encounter with a federal agency. Jason Osterhaus will serve as a contact and representative at community events and meetings for Shawnee, Douglas, Wyandotte, Miami, Lyon, Ottawa, Osage, Jackson and Jefferson Counties. They join State Director Alex Richard and District Representative Michele Payne in representing the northeast region of Kansas out of the Olathe office. Susan Metsker, District Representative:&nbsp;Metsker previously served 12 years as a member of the Shawnee Mission School District Board of Education and currently serves on the Board of Directors for Inclusion Connections. Metsker served as a district representative for Congressman Kevin Yoder for eight years and prior to that she worked nearly 20 years in development for a non-profit youth organization. Metsker holds a Master&#8217;s in Public Administration from the University of Kansas. Jason Osterhaus, District Representative:&nbsp;Osterhaus, a resident of Overland Park, served on the Johnson County Commission for the past eight years where he worked to oversee the Johnson County Library Master Plan, expand the Johnson County Mental Health Department, including the Veterans Treatment Courts, supported the construction of the New Johnson County Courthouse and Coroners Facility, and corrected the understaffing of the Johnson County Sheriff&#8217;s office. Previously, Osterhaus worked at Sprint and Perceptive Software. He is a former board member of the Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault and as an Eagle Scout, is the former Chair of the Shawnee Trails Boy Scout Nominating Committee. Osterhaus graduated from the Park University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with a degree in Communications.  &nbsp;  Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C.

The new year brings us an opportunity to renew discussions and put forward policy that addresses the real needs of the American people such as healthcare reform. Every place I&#8217;ve gone throughout our district, I&#8217;ve been told stories about how our current healthcare system is failing Missourians, from the rising cost of prescription drugs and the lack of transparency in medical prices, to the grave concerns Missourians have on proposals like Medicare for All. My constituents have made these concerns absolutely clear. Over the next several weeks, I want to take the opportunity to discuss different ideas and policy proposals that address these great burdens facing many Missourians. This week, I want to discuss H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, a bill that helps make healthcare more affordable, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs and protecting pre-existing coverage.    H.R. 19, which includes nearly 50 reforms supported by both Republicans and Democrats, also caps the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Our bill also includes a &#8220;smoothing out&#8221; mechanism that would allow seniors to distribute their out-of-pocket expenses throughout the year. A core element of H.R. 19 is fostering competition in the market to drive down the cost of prescription drugs and spur innovation. For example, H.R. 19 allows more generic drugs to come into the market and compete with the big players, preventing &#8220;big pharma&#8221; from manipulating the market and keeping generic equivalent medicines from people who need them the most. Americans from all walks of life are experiencing the challenges of rising health care costs. It is a bipartisan problem that impacts everyone &#8211; Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, and is an issue where we must all come together in order to solve.&nbsp; While there are still many aspects of health care reform that need to be addressed, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, is a good start to achieving affordability of our healthcare.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________ These past weeks have been very good on the trade front with the United States Senate passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which passed the House of Representatives last month with my support. President Trump and his administration also took a step forward in improving our trading relationship with China, signing this week Phase I of the trade deal with China.      Ambassador Robert Lighthizer after a presentation before Members of Congress on the USMCA  I&#8217;m incredibly happy to see all the progress on trade being made by President Trump, Trade Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the entire Trump administration. Trade is paramount to our economy, our farmers and small businesses, American manufacturers, and every American family. With over 95 percent of the world&#8217;s population living outside our borders, we need to do everything possible to expand opportunities to sell more American products to consumers in other nations. It is also important that trade agreements be fair and up-to-date in today&#8217;s business environment. Passage of the USMCA and the signing of Phase I trade deal with China accomplishes this and moves us forward as a nation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________  On Wednesday, the University of Missouri announced that it would cut its relationship with the Chinese-funded Confucius Institute. For over a year, I have been meeting with officials at both the University of Missouri and Columbia Public Schools to express my concerns with the Confucius Institute. I applaud the University of Missouri&#8217;s decision to end its ties with this Chinese-government run program. Confucius Institutes serve as a critical component of the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s soft power propaganda campaign and are often praised by party officials as a major source of influence abroad to ultimately advance their world power agenda. Some Confucius Institutes have also been used as a source of research espionage threatening our national defense. I have been pleased that since&nbsp;meeting with university and school officials, oversight mechanisms have been implemented. While the impetus for cancelling the Mizzou program was new requirements from the State Department which imposed new costs on the University, the decision to end the program is welcomed and protects academic integrity and the security of our nation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________  Last Thursday, I appeared on Fox News to discuss the tensions between the United States and Iran. The Iranian regime has a long history of hostility, which has taken a multitude of American lives. Appeasing a tyrant will not stop him; bold action will. I am grateful Soleimani will no longer be plotting evil on innocent civilians who yearn for freedom. Qassem Soleimani, who was one of the chief architects of Iran&#8217;s hostile military strategy targeting American forces and undermining our security interests in the region, was invariably a tyrant. Over 600 American families had an empty place at their holiday gatherings this year due to the calculated attacks ordered by Soleimani. He was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and was intent on committing further attacks against our men and women in uniform. When President Trump learned Soleimani was orchestrating further attacks and more American lives were at stake, he took bold and decisive action. This was a strategic course of action to prevent more American casualties at the hands of the Iranian regime. The world is a safer place as a result. Click on the video below to watch my full interview with Fox News&#8217; Trace Gallagher:    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; _____________  Earlier this month, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), on which I sit, issued its annual China Report. The analysis produced by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China highlights a disturbing trend under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. The rule of law in China continues to deteriorate, human rights abuses are worsening, and the Communist Party is projecting total and complete control over its citizens. Simply put, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is committing crimes against humanity.    The CPP also continues their coercive population control methods. Local family planning officials are instructed to conduct IUD insertions, abortions, and sterilization to prevent and control &#8220;illegal pregnancies.&#8221; Families who violate China&#8217;s &#8220;two child policy,&#8221; face heavy fines, job termination, and forced abortion, which is often referred to as a &#8220;remedial measure&#8221; for unsanctioned pregnancies. China&#8217;s coercive population control policies, and its preference for males, are human rights violations that are fueling other dangerous practices such as human trafficking and illegal adoptions.

District Update Residents of MO-4 are aware that there are so many good people working and making a difference in our district&#8217;s communities. But it&#8217;s always great to get the recognition from someone outside the district. The Milken Family Foundation, which recognizes the outstanding work of K-12 educators, annually honors between 20 and 30 teachers, principals, and school administrators across the country. Winners each receive recognition and a $25,000 award. Missouri had one of this year&#8217;s winners &#8211; Melissa Fike, a math teacher at Oakland Middle School in Columbia. She was surprised to hear her name announced as the winner during a school assembly attended by Oakland&#8217;s students and staff. The Milken Family Foundation Award has been called &#8220;the Oscars of Teaching.&#8221; Congratulations to Melissa Fike for her great work making a difference in the lives of so many young people.    Oakland Middle School math teacher was shocked to hear her name announced as a Milken Family Foundation Teacher of the Year (Photo courtesy of Milken Foundation) Constituent Update I love to share good news about our successes in helping constituents who are having difficulty dealing with federal government agencies or departments. Casework Manager Janna Worsham recently helped a veteran who had been receiving Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and Concurrent Retirement Disability Pay (CRDP). Mistakes happen, and the VA withheld part of this veteran&#8217;s compensation. After Janna looked into the problem and worked things out with the VA, the veteran was compensated for the amount that was deducted and is once again receiving the benefits he has earned. If you&#8217;re a veteran who has an issue with the VA or any other agency, give Janna a call in our Columbia office at 573-442-9311 and she&#8217;ll do all she can to help.

This year, it is expected that more than 27,000 cases of stomach cancer will be diagnosed in the United States.&nbsp;In 2018, Indianapolis Star reporter, Matt Tully passed away after a two-year battle with this deadly disease. Matt used his column to shine a light on local problems and the people working to solve them. Last Friday, I had the honor of presenting the Stomach Cancer Awareness Month resolution in his honor. &nbsp;For more, click here.  Senate Republicans Committed to Getting Substantive Work Done Hoosiers, like so many other Americans, want the Senate to get substantive work done. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m focused on protecting our national security, lowering healthcare costs, providing affordable housing, ensuring higher education is accessible, and passing the USMCA trade agreement. We advanced USMCA closer to the finish line last week in the Senate Finance Committee, and I will continue working to ensure it passes the full Senate. These are a few of my top priorities for 2020, and I know that Republicans in the Senate are committed to getting real results for the American people.  More here.&nbsp;    My Statement on Iran&nbsp; President Obama&#8217;s Iran nuclear deal gave Iran two big concessions: economic sanctions relief and an international blessing for its nuclear program. This flawed nuclear deal turned a blind eye toward Iran&#8217;s destabilizing activities across the region while establishing a legal pathway, the economic resources, and the international community to protect Iran&#8217;s nuclear future.   In 2018, President Donald J. Trump made the right decision to change course and withdraw from the Obama nuclear deal. Instead of starting with cash, President Trump started with pressure. President Trump&#8217;s maximum pressure campaign on Iran has always been aimed at fixing the glaring gaps in the Obama nuclear deal and denying Iran the resources to support terror groups from Yemen to Syria and Lebanon.   Unfortunately, rather than change its behavior, Iran has instead inflamed tensions further by sabotaging oil tankers in the Gulf, downing a U.S. Navy drone, holding a British-flagged tanker hostage, targeting Iraqi military bases, and killing an American. Then we witnessed the attack on our U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Once again, President Trump responded not with empty rhetoric but with action and ordered a strike to kill Qasem Soleimani.   Soleimani was a terrorist mastermind responsible for killing hundreds of Americans &amp; thousands of Iraqis, Syrians, Yemenis and others. He provided support for the barbaric Assad regime in Syria, facilitating human rights atrocities &amp; ethnic cleansing of thousands of Sunnis. He also provided critical support for terror groups across the world including Hezbollah, the Taliban, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Former Secretary Mattis said &#8220;Everywhere you find turmoil in the Middle East, you find Iran&#8217;s hand in it.&#8221;   Thankfully, rather than give Iran the ability to continue its destabilizing activities, we have a President who acted to protect our service members and to project peace through strength. There is no question our nation is safer today now that Soleimani is dead and I commend President Trump for taking decisive action.  &nbsp;: Photo Review&nbsp;   For an overview of the past week in photos,&nbsp;click here&nbsp;or the image above.

From advocating for a bill to clean our drinking water to voting to secure our telecommunication networks, there is so much to tell you. Scroll down for a recap!  &nbsp;    Championing Legislation to Protect Our Drinking Water  &nbsp;  Earlier this week, I voted for the PFAS Action Act of 2019 (H.R. 535). This bipartisan bill, which I cosponsored, would take steps to clean sites contaminated by hazardous per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) across Coastal Virginia and America.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The PFAS Action Act will require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to list several categories of PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the Superfund program. It also requires the EPA to set enforceable limits on the levels of certain PFAS in drinking water and direct federal resources to clean sites contaminated by PFAS. Within five years of the bill's enactment, it would instruct the EPA to make a final decision on the safety status of all remaining categories of PFAS. This bill also authorizes $800 million in appropriations for entities that help fund infrastructure upgrades that reduce PFAS exposure.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In Hampton Roads, PFAS are a clear and present threat to our servicemembers and their families. The PFAS Action Act is an important step toward addressing this public health issue with the attention and urgency that it demands. I am pleased to vote for this legislation, and I will continue to prioritize the long-term health of Coastal Virginians by protecting our drinking water from this carcinogenic contaminant.  &nbsp;    Safeguarding American Telecommunications from Foreign Threats  &nbsp;  On Wednesday, I voted to secure our telecommunications infrastructure from foreign privacy and security threats, a growing problem as our nation transitions to 5th generation telecommunications (5G). I was pleased to announce the House passage of several bills that promote our national security interests by ensuring that America sets the international standards for 5G telecommunications.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The implementation of 5G telecommunications will revolutionize the way Americans communicate, send, and receive valuable information. As these technologies are rolled out, America must implement international standards to protect the security of our nation and our allies from foreign interference. I am proud to vote to expand America&#8217;s role as a key leader in setting these international regulations.  &nbsp;    Engaging with Constituents  &nbsp;  Over the past year, I have had the honor of meeting and connecting with countless constituent organizations.  &nbsp;  During 2019, my office and I hosted 1,195 constituent meetings. This was the second most constituent meetings held by a freshman representative. I am proud of our active presence in the community and I am looking forward to meeting with many more constituents!  &nbsp;    Mobile Office Hours in Virginia Beach and Nassawadox  &nbsp;  This week, our team is hosting mobile office hours in Virginia Beach and Nassawadox. We are eager to assist you with federal issues including Social Security, veterans' affairs, Medicaid, and more. For more information, please see below!  &nbsp;    Virginia Beach Mobile Office Hours  &nbsp;    Nassawadox Mobile Office Hours  &nbsp;    AmeriCorps Community Service in Chincoteague  &nbsp;  I am happy to announce that the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) has begun important work on the Eastern Shore.  &nbsp;  AmeriCorps NCCC is a full time residential service program that strengthens communities through community service. Last Friday, an NCCC team began a project at the Chincoteague Wildlife Refuge to replace 17 miles of fencing that holds 150 horses. The team's work will prevent overgrazing and support the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company.&nbsp;  &nbsp;      On Wednesday, our office held mobile office hours in James City County. I was excited to hear that a constituent visited to thank us for our help. In June, Nancy contacted our office and we were able to save her money in social security benefits!&nbsp;  &nbsp;      I enjoyed stopping by Corey&#8217;s Chicken Shack in James City County! I always enjoy touring small businesses, meeting constituents, and the delicious food was a great bonus!&nbsp; &nbsp;    I enjoyed telling you about my week and I look forward to telling you about many more!

With a new year comes new resolutions, so I would like to send you an update on some of the priorities I plan to work on for Arizonans in 2020. At the end of this newsletter will be a suggestion box for you to pass along any additional priorities to include in our 2020 outlook.  Growing Our Economy   Each month of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 I would update you on the difference in U.S. Treasury Receipts post-tax reform. From the chart above, you can see FY 2019 showed substantial growth over years 2017 and 2018. This is exciting news and I will continue to update this graph throughout 2020 once we have enough data to compare.&nbsp; We all saw this week's news surrounding Arizona's growth. The graph below shows the past decade of growth for our state compared to the predicted growth. With friendly business regulations and strong trade Arizona will continue to see this growth in coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Continuing to grow our economy is one of my top priorities.&nbsp;The success of thousands of jobs added, low unemployment, and a strong labor force has put the United States on top as a global competitor, and we must continue on this path by developing pro-growth policies that will put Arizona and America first.&nbsp;  Finding a Cure for Valley Fever  During my time in Congress, I have worked hard to bring awareness and research funding to fight Valley Fever. We have developed the FORWARD Act, legislation to combat Valley Fever, and hosted round tables each year to increase awareness for this fungal disease.&nbsp; It is one of my top priorities to get the FORWARD Act across the finish line in 2020. With bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, I believe we can get this much needed legislation passed to support Arizonans.  I would also like to continue to host round tables to foster discussion among professionals and community members with first-hand knowledge of this disease. Together we can bring justice to all of those in the Southwest infected by this horrific disease.&nbsp;  Incentivizing Technology Solutions We are currently experiencing a revolution in technology that can help to crash the price of services. Whether this be in healthcare, climate technology, or other policy areas, we must begin to create incentives for Americans to invest in technology solutions that will lead to healthier and more efficient lives.&nbsp;    This can be done through changes to our tax code that will incentivize implementation of clean energy, similar to the power plant without a smoke stack in West Texas, or removing barriers in our healthcare system that prohibit portable and efficient technology from being made available to us.&nbsp; I often speak on the House Floor and during Ways and Means Committee hearings about the new technology we have available and on the horizon.&nbsp;We should be including all of these solutions in our policy discussions to help future-proof legislation. I will continue to advocate for the benefits of new technology and how this body must look towards the future in our policy discussions.&nbsp;  Strengthening Our Trade This past year's trade news has been largely dedicated to passing the United States, Mexico, Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA). While I continue serving on the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, I plan to focus on strengthening our trade with other nations as well in 2020.&nbsp; I am committed to ensuring Arizona has access to free and fair trade, while also ensuring the United States&#8217; trading relationships are kept a high priority. We must continue expanding access to emerging markets and create opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, farmers and service providers to sell more American-made goods and services around the world.&nbsp; Providing Constituent Services   Our office has the distinct pleasure of helping constituents with federal casework assistance, recognizing Arizonan's striving to provide greatness in our community, scheduling tours during visits to Washington, D.C., accepting internship applicants, and much more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing the hard work of Arizonans selflessly helping others in our community is one of my favorite services. In 2019, we recognized businesses, individuals, and organizations who are giving back to Arizonans to make our community stronger.&nbsp;  If you would like to request a Certificate of Congressional Recognition for a member of Arizona&#8217;s 6th Congressional District, click here to fill out a quick form. We look forward to recognizing all of the kind individuals in AZ-06 who make Arizona the best place to call home.&nbsp;  For a list of all of the services our office can help you with, click .&nbsp;  I appreciate you taking the time to read my weekly E-Newsletter. Below you can find a space to leave additional priorities that you would like to see me focus on in 2020. Please note this newsletter only touched on a few of my priorities. I look forward to hearing how else I can best serve Arizonans in 2020!  What additional priorities would you like me to focus on in 2020?&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Schweikert                          &nbsp; WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 1526 Longworth HOBWashington, D.C. 20515Phone: (202) 225-2190Fax: (202) 225-0096 SCOTTSDALE DISTRICT OFFICE 14500 N.

I am proudly working to put Central Washington's priorities first, and it is truly a privilege to represent our District in Congress.&nbsp; The year began on a high note, as I joined President Trump in the Oval Office for the signing of a comprehensive lands package, which included my language to authorize Phase 3 of the Yakima Project. The future of our agriculture economy depends on access to water storage, and the signing of this bill represents bipartisan collaboration on one of the most important priorities for the Yakima River Basin. The lands package also contained language I worked to include that will protect the Methow Valley Headwaters from mining, an important effort that was brought to me by local constituents in Okanogan County.&nbsp;  In March, I had the humbling opportunity to dedicate the Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office in West Richland, in honor of a young Marine who passed away in July 2017 in service to our country. We were joined by his family, friends, brothers-in-arms, and former Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis as we unveiled the plaque that will serve as a reminder of Dietrich's service and sacrifice.  As I worked with my colleagues to represent our interests at home - from protecting the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center program to securing funding for the Hanford cleanup and addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, I also worked to directly serve you. I hosted a variety of public events, including a Job Fair, Small Business Expo, Health &amp; Safety Fair, and numerous issue-based roundtables to discuss forest issues, immigration, conservation, and more.&nbsp;I traveled across the 4th Congressional District, touring local businesses, visiting schools and hospitals, and learning about how federal issues affect you.&nbsp;  My office assisted 359 constituents with federal agencies, from the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Department of Agriculture to the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. These cases resulted in $4,744,091 being saved or returned to Central Washington families. My staff hosted 66 Mobile Office Hours across the District, to better serve those in rural areas outside of Yakima and Benton Counties. I connected with over 11,000 constituents on live telephone town halls, where I heard directly from you and answered your questions about a variety of topics like healthcare, land management, and Second Amendment rights. Lastly, my office helped arrange nearly 300 tours of the U.S. Capitol, the White House, and other landmarks for constituents visiting Washington, D.C.&nbsp; We have a lot to be proud of, and we have a lot of work to do. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act, the historic agriculture labor reform bill I helped to write and pass in the House, still awaits action in the Senate. Despite progress with the Yakima Project, our nation's water infrastructure is crumbling and in desperate need of updating. The House voted to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to strengthen our trade relationship with our neighbors to the north and south, and I look forward to continuing to gain momentum with other trade relationships across the globe.&nbsp; As the second session of the 116th Congress reconvenes, I will continue to work on your behalf with the people and the priorities of Central Washington in my heart and mind.&nbsp;  Sincerely,  Dan Newhouse Member of Congress          UPCOMING MOBILE OFFICE HOURS My staff hosts monthly Mobile Office Hours across Central Washington.

January:  In January I was proud to introduce the Poison Center Network Enhancement Act of 2019, to assist with potential poison exposures and help combat the national opioid crisis.&nbsp; Poison control centers are vital to preventing toxic exposure and poisoning injury and deaths, including opioid and other drug overdoses.&nbsp; This bill reauthorizes funding for the Poison Center Network, including their national toll-free number (800) 222-1222.&nbsp; It also clarifies that poison control centers can be called upon to assist with public health emergencies, responses, and preparedness; and requests that enhanced communications&nbsp;capabilities like texting be established.&nbsp; I am happy to report that in the recently passed spending bill this legislation was reauthorized for a period of 5 years.  &nbsp;   Congresswoman Brooks hosted Tony and Kelly Trent as her guests to the President&#8217;s State of the Union Address and visited Vice President and Second Lady, Mike and Karen Pence.  February:  It was a privilege and an honor to host Tony and Kelly Trent for the State of the Union Address.&nbsp; The Trents are the parents of Tyler Trent, a young Purdue super fan who dedicated his life to inspiring and helping others.&nbsp; Tyler was a remarkable, life-long Hoosier who&#8217;s spirit filled college football stadiums and TV screens as he cheered for the Purdue Boilermakers and bravely battled osteosarcoma.&nbsp; We could feel Tyler&#8217;s spirit in the Capitol that evening.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Congresswoman Susan Brooks joins members of her Youth Advisory Group for a discussion focused on fighting poverty in the Fifth District.  March:  In March I was proud to convene another meeting of my Youth Advisory Group comprised of students between 8th and 12th grade from schools across the Fifth District.&nbsp; Our discussion focused on how each of us can make a lasting impact to reduce poverty locally.&nbsp; Students participated in a simulation where they had to make real-life decisions for how they would budget their minimal finances in order to spend their money wisely.&nbsp; I continue to be impressed by the group&#8217;s enthusiasm to tackle such important topics.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks pins the Bronze Star on WWII Army Medic Walter Murphy at a ceremony in April.  April:  My team was instrumental in securing a long overdue Bronze Star Medal for Walter Roy Murphy who honorably served our country in the US Army during WWII as a combat medic.&nbsp; In the course of Mr. Murphy&#8217;s service he saw action during the Battle of the Bulge and other dangerous battlefields.&nbsp; His heroism during his service had gone previously unrecognized.&nbsp; Thanks to a special provision in law, and the heartfelt work of Mr. Murphy&#8217;s grandson, William Anders, and my office, Mr. Murphy was able to receive the Bronze Star he earned more than 70 years ago for his service.&nbsp;&nbsp;     Indianapolis Police Officer, Jake Laird, shot and killed in 2004 in the line of duty.&nbsp;  May:  May is host to National Police Week and Mental Health Awareness Month.&nbsp; This past May I continued my pursuit of bipartisan solutions to tough problems when I reintroduced the Jake Laird Act, a bipartisan bill named after an Indianapolis police officer who was shot and killed in 2004 in the line of duty by a man who struggled with mental illness. The Jake Laird Act provides grants to states to enact red flag laws substantially similar to Indiana&#8217;s Jake Laird Law, equipping our police officers with training and additional tools to deescalate life-threatening crisis situations. If enacted, such laws will enable local law enforcement, with probable cause, to temporarily remove and retain firearms from individuals who are determined to be an imminent danger to themselves or others. &nbsp;    The President signs PAHPA into law on June 24, 2019.  June:  I was proud to join the President in the Oval Office as he signed a bill that I authored into law.&nbsp; The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 (PAHPA) is the product of years of collaborations between Congress and medical and public health preparedness and response stakeholders.&nbsp; PAHPA will ensure our nation is better prepared to respond to a wide range of public health emergencies, whether the result of natural disasters, infectious diseases or man-made disasters like terrorist attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks meets with Members of the Select Committee to discuss recommendations.  July:  The once-in-a-generation Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, on which I serve, voted to unanimously approve our second round of congressional recommendations.&nbsp; The 24 recommendations were crafted with the intention of boosting the quality of constituent engagement, increasing staff retention and expertise on Capitol Hill and ensuring Americans with disabilities have access to all procedures and functions of the House.&nbsp; The House recently voted to extend the Committee through the end of the 116th Congress.&nbsp; This extension will allow the Select Committee to continue its work proposing bipartisan reforms to make Congress work better for the American people by focusing on increasing civility, reforming the schedule, improving constituent communications and updating the budget and appropriations process.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Congresswoman Brooks joins other elected officials, community leaders and supporters in Anderson for the dedication of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge.  August:  In August it was an honor to join other elected officials, community leaders and supporters in Anderson for the dedication of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge, which links businesses, commuters, bicyclists and pedestrians to downtown Anderson. This bridge is now dedicated to men and women of Madison County who bravely served our country in the armed forces.&nbsp; With my help Anderson was successful in securing a federal TIGER grant of $13.5 million to build this beautiful and critical bridge.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Watch Congresswoman Brooks&#8217; remarks on the House floor in support of H.R. 550, Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.  September:  The House of Representatives passed the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019, a bill I had previously introduced.&nbsp; This legislation will present the highest civilian award Congress can bestow to the Merchant Mariners who acted heroically to transport troops and provide critical supplies of war to U.S. troops by sea during World War II. &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks visits with a class at Noblesville Schools&#8217; Hinkle Creek Elementary School.  October:  Throughout our country, elected officials had the opportunity to participate in National Principal Shadowing Week to bring recognition to the principals hard work and dedication to our students. I was able to join Principal Lawrence of&nbsp;Noblesville Schools&#8217; Hinkle Creek Elementary School&nbsp;and had a wonderful time meeting students, stopping in classrooms and participating in afternoon announcements. Our school leaders are shaping our nation&#8217;s future leaders and I hope everyone takes a moment to say thank you to our principals and teachers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks attends the naming ceremony of the USS RICHARD G. LUGAR.  November:  I was honored to join&nbsp;Senator Todd Young,&nbsp;Senator Mike Braun, the former Secretary of the&nbsp;U.S. Navy&nbsp;Richard V. Spencer and Char Lugar, wife of the late Senator Richard G. Lugar for the naming ceremony of the USS RICHARD G. LUGAR. To be named in Senator Lugar&#8217;s honor, this Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyer warship will help prepare our country for future challenges we may face, equip the men and women of the United States Navy and serve our nation alongside the most powerful naval fleet in the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;    Congresswoman Brooks joined the Indiana Soybean Alliance/Indiana Corn Marketing Council in August at a Greentown Shop Talk event at Kirkpatrick Farms.&nbsp;  December: In December I was proud to vote for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement because it is a victory for Hoosier workers, farmers, small businesses and manufacturers.&nbsp; Indiana is the 8th largest agricultural exporter in the nation and home to over 500,000 small businesses that employ 45 percent of Hoosiers.&nbsp; As I have traveled the district over the past year the most regular request I received was to finally pass USMCA.&nbsp; I am happy to say as the last vote of the year on December 19th, we got that done.&nbsp; When USMCA becomes law it will foster economic certainty and open new markets for Hoosier farmers and businesses, a major victory for the Fifth District.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and I look forward to continuing to work on behalf of all Fifth District Hoosiers in 2020. &nbsp;To get instant updates on my work, be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Click here to read more in the Washington Examiner. Unlike Pelosi, House Republicans have a bipartisan cure for prescription drug costs As physicians and healthcare providers, and now policymakers, we believe that innovation will drive the cost of healthcare down more than any new law or policy. Whether here in Congress or in our office as a physician, we strive to keep patients out of the hospital and at home and healthy with their loved ones. Having the best tools and medicine in our toolkit helps us achieve that mission. Patients deserve access to cutting-edge medicine that is going to treat, and maybe even cure, Alzheimers or diabetes. We need to make sure the next miracle drug sitting in the approval pipeline that could cure childhood cancers, as well as metastatic breast, lung, skin, prostate, or pancreatic cancers, are more quickly available for your loved ones. Lives literally depend on it. While we were in medical, pharmacy and dental school, there were simply no cures or good treatment options for most cancers, leukemia, hepatitis, depression, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Within the last decade, weve seen groundbreaking medical miracles. One notable example is former President Jimmy Carter, who had widespread metastatic melanoma and was treated by a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Thanks to American research and ingenuity, we have medicine unlike the world has ever seen, such as CAR T-cell therapy. Two therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration within the last two years to defeat lymphoma and acute pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia. More recently, the FDA approved a miracle drug for cystic fibrosis, which affects 30,000 Americans. And, finally, its worth mentioning that just six years ago, Hepatitis C was a death sentence. Thanks to investments in innovation, 3.5 million people with Hepatitis C can now take a pill once a week for 12 weeks and be completely cured. None of these treatments would have been made available if it werent for the United States protecting innovation and encouraging innovators to be pioneers. Last year, national healthcare spending reached $3.6 trillion. About one-third of all healthcare spending is tied to hospital care, while prescription drugs make up 9%. About 28% of the federal budget is now being spent directly on healthcare. If we are ever going to balance the federal budget, we must get the cost of healthcare under control. Protecting and streamlining the next miracle drugs is an obvious way to help do that. We cannot even begin to guess what the savings to Medicare costs would be if we had the cure for Alzheimers and dementia and other illnesses where Medicare is the single largest payer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently introduced, and the House passed, H.R. 3, a government price-fixing bill that would absolutely decimate private research and development for potential future miracle drugs to come to market. As with any other industry, the federal government takeover of medicine will halt innovation and lower quality. While it may seem popular today to demonize Western medicine, America is still the gold standard and global leader in cutting-edge medicine. Of note, of the 270 drugs that have come to the world market since 2011, 100% are available to patients in America, compared to 8% in China, 41% in Australia, 52% in Canada, and 67% in Germany. With that said, as policymakers, we recognize the need to balance innovation while appropriately addressing shortcomings in our system. Were addressing these failures head-on. Our solution is H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. The provisions in this legislation are bipartisan and will lower out-of-pocket patient spending, protect access to new medicines and cures, strengthen transparency, and champion competition. We want to promote innovation, which requires government getting out of the way  not more government red tape. H.R. 19 will make the process for FDA drug approval far more streamlined and, among other things, promote generic competition. Finally, for the first time ever, this bill provides seniors and Medicare recipients a cap on out-of-pocket drug spending, which allows them to budget their out-of-pocket expenses annually. We want to reiterate that every single provision in this legislative alternative is bipartisan. H.R. 19 could actually become law. We truly can lower drug costs for consumers without destroying innovation, unlike with H.R. 3. Thanks to the Trump administrations leadership, people now have twice the number of generic drugs approved per year in comparison to the previous administration, and the actual costs of prescriptions have gone down slightly for the first time in modern medical history. This is just the beginning. Republicans are ready to do more to work together with Democrats to lower prescription drug prices without killing ingenuity with government control. As physicians and healthcare providers, we will continue to advocate for incentivizing good health and prevention. Lets get to work and deliver meaningful solutions to all. By GOP Reps.

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Wishing You Happy Holidays  Happy&nbsp;holidays to you and yours! Robba and I hope that you are able to spend quality time with loved ones during this joyous season. May God bless you and your families in the New Year!  As we gather with loved ones to celebrate this season, we are also thinking of the many men and women in uniform at home and abroad who are unable to be with friends and family as they fight to protect our homeland. Missing the holidays represents one of the many sacrifices our servicemembers and their families make, and I am grateful for their dedicated service to their fellow Americans.  Safeguarding our FreedomsOn Tuesday, the Senate&nbsp;passed&nbsp;the&nbsp;National Defense Authorization Act&nbsp;(NDAA), which is critical to safeguarding our freedoms and supporting our servicemembers and their families. This legislation further modernizes our military and includes the largest pay raise for our troops in nearly a decade. I applaud my colleagues for working to create a bipartisan bill that we can send to the President&#8217;s desk. I was particularly pleased to see several of my priorities included in the final legislation. This includes the Cyber Red Team Assessment to increase security against new and emerging cyber threats, which will help support missions related to the 177th Information Aggressor Squadron of the Kansas Air National Guard Unit stationed at McConnell Air Force Base. In addition, the NDAA includes my bill,&nbsp;the Global Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing Act,&nbsp;to strengthen Kansas manufacturers, specifically within aerospace, defense, technology and agriculture. I&#8217;m also pleased that this bill will secure a Military-Type Certification for the Textron AT-6 Light Attack Aircraft, which will have a significant impact on the Kansas aerospace community. To read more about my priorities included in this legislation, please click here.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Funding our Government Passing the CJS Appropriations Package  On Thursday, the Senate passed my&nbsp;FY2020 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations&nbsp;bill. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee who authored this legislation, this fiscally responsible bill includes essential resources to further our nation&#8217;s priorities in scientific innovation, law enforcement and economic development. This legislation will not only benefit Kansans with federal programs aimed to keep communities safe and invest in infrastructure, but it also accelerates the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon and cementing our country&#8217;s leadership in space exploration. This legislation also strengthens trade enforcement and invests in advancing severe weather forecasting. I am grateful to have worked closely with Ranking Member Shaheen to pass a good government, bipartisan bill that enables numerous agencies within our jurisdiction to accomplish their missions and address the needs of our nation. I look forward to President Trump signing this legislation into law and seeing the ways in which these federal resources impact communities in Kansas and across the country.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  NIH Appropriations Increase Throughout my time in Congress, I have been an advocate for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its mission to save lives, invest in the next generation of Americans and help to establish the United States as a world leader in health research and innovation. This week Congress&nbsp;provided additional resources&nbsp;that will serve to assist our nation&#8217;s top minds and researchers in new discoveries, including treatments and cures for diseases. In addition, deadly and devastating diseases result in large financial pressure on families and our healthcare system. NIH&#8217;s research serves to find new treatments and therefore reduces costs, serving to benefit all Americans.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Appropriations Increase for International Food Aid Within the FY2020 Appropriations package that&nbsp;passed&nbsp;last week were increases to international food aid resources. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I work to prioritize funding for our international food aid programs and I was pleased to see that both the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program and the Food for Peace Title II Grants received increases in funding to further their missions and assist in reducing global food security, and benefits Kansas farmers in moving commodities, such as grain. This is an issue in which the morally correct thing to do is also what&#8217;s in the best interest of our country. By continuing to invest in Food for Peace, McGovern-Dole, and other international food aid programs, food grown by U.S. and Kansas farmers will save lives around the world and reduce conflict by promoting greater social and economic stability.  &nbsp;  Promoting Advancement in Technical Aviation Training  Recently, I introduced&nbsp;The Promoting Aviation Regulations for Technical Training (PARTT) 147 Act of 2019. This legislation would establish performance-based regulations to ensure aviation maintenance education institutions have the flexibility to teach core curriculum reflective of the ongoing technical advances and innovation happening across the aviation and aerospace industry. Updated 50 years ago, these regulations are no longer reflective of the modernized industry, and updated curriculum requirements are critical in ensuring our future workforce of highly-skilled aviation maintenance technicians.&nbsp; Providing Better Care for Our Veterans On Wednesday, I&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;the&nbsp;Competitive Pay for Leaders in Veterans Health Care Act&nbsp;to make certain we have the highest quality workforce at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) delivering the best possible care to our veterans. Nine years ago, we passed a law to help VA recruit and retain the best and brightest leaders to manage the many different specialty care functions that VA provides. This bill will make certain that VA retains the ability to provide competitive pay to attract and keep highly specialized and highly competent leaders serving our veterans in the nation&#8217;s largest integrated healthcare system. Without this change, VA would need to collect the higher payment amount back from current and past employees and would face significant challenges hiring qualified healthcare providers.    Honoring Kansans at Arlington National Cemetery This Tuesday I attended the funeral of Colonel (Ret.) Clyde and Sadie Tate at Arlington National Cemetery. Clyde and Sadie were the parents of one of my law school classmates, Butch, who went on to serve as the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army before retiring in 2013. Clyde had a distinguished career in the United States Army, enlisting in 1948 and rising to the rank of Sergeant First Class before commissioning as a second lieutenant in 1953. Throughout his career, Clyde served two combat tours in Vietnam, once deploying from Fort Riley, Kansas. His final posting allowed him to serve as the Director of the Department of Tactics at the Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a school that his son would eventually graduate. Throughout Clyde&#8217;s military career, Sadie made certain the family was happy and healthy after braving 37 moves. Attending Clyde&#8217;s funeral and catching up with Butch was a somber occasion, but one that filled me with gratitude. The funeral was just days after Wreaths Across America took place, an event in which thousands of patriotic Americans across the country place wreaths on the gravestones of our fallen service members in national cemeteries, including the 400,000 in Arlington alone. Walking through Arlington National Cemetery and seeing every memorial stone adorned with a carefully-placed wreath highlighted the impact of these veteran&#8217;s sacrifices and the debt we owe them for their service. As we look forward to Christmas, I ask you to keep the men and women serving in uniform in your prayers during this holiday season.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Judicial Nominations Reach Record Numbers  At of the end of this week, the Senate confirmed the 187th Article III judge appointed by President Donald Trump. This includes the appointments of Judges Holly Teeter and John Broomes to the court for the District of Kansas, 50 circuit court judges, 133 district court judges and two international trade court judges. Working together, President Trump and the Senate sat more appellate court judges than any president in history. There is still work to be done with another 84 total judicial vacancies in the US and I will continue to work with my colleagues to fill these seats and ensure timely court access for all Americans.  Confirming Kansan Michael Graham On Thursday, the U.S. Senate confirmed Michael Graham to serve as a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board. A Wichita native, Mr. Graham currently serves as the Director of Flight Operations Safety, Security, and Standardization at Textron Aviation, where he has worked since 1997. Prior to his work in the aviation industry, he spent nine years as a Naval Aviator flying A-7&#8217;s and F/A 18&#8217;s as well as being an F/A-18 Aircrew instructor for Boeing/McDonnell Douglas. With a long and decorated career of service and safety, both in the military and as a civilian, Mr. Graham is well suited to be a member of the National Transportation Safety Board and I am proud to call him a Kansan. I appreciate his willingness to continue to serve our country and look forward to continuing to work together here in Washington. To watch my introduction of Mr. Graham to the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year, please click&nbsp;here.    Paying My Respects to Ben Bennett On Friday morning, I attended the funeral service for a longtime public servant and friend, Ben Bennett. Ben began serving the community of Junction City in 1965 when he accepted a position as a high school government teacher and head wrestling coach, quickly establishing himself across the country for his positive impact on student-athletes. After his teaching and coaching career, Ben continued his public service as the Geary County Commissioner for over a decade. From my first days as a Congressman, I was lucky to know Ben and his desire to give back to his community. He served those around him loyally, and truly embodied the Kansan way of life. Ben&#8217;s impact on the community will be remembered by many..  Visiting Mitchell CountyAlso on Friday, I was in Mitchell County for a Kansas Listening Tour Stop in Beloit.

LEGISLATION 47TH DISTRICT ABOUT ALAN CONTACT ALAN &nbsp;                In This Edition  This week, I joined with my House colleagues in passing two articles of impeachment against President Trump.  I also voted this week to approve government funding for fiscal year 2020. While the House this week passed a bill to implement the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade bill, I could not support it due to the agreement's failure to address climate change. I voted this week to restore the full deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). A reminder that applications for those who wish to participate in the Congressional Foster Shadow Day 2020 are due no later than December 31. In the Inbox this week, I share a letter I sent to constituents who wrote in asking me to support the College Affordability Act. Congress U this week looks at the history of the Congressional Christmas Tree.  Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to look at last week&#8217;s poll results, and make sure you take this week&#8217;s poll in the right-hand column.            CONNECT WITH ME              &nbsp;     Will you be travelling for the holidays this year?  Yes   No   Maybe   Don't know/Unsure      &nbsp;If you have a problem, click here to open survey in a new window        &nbsp;  &nbsp;       Passing Articles Of Impeachment  As a Member of Congress, I have taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution.  I believe that I, along with my colleagues in the House, upheld our oaths in voting to impeach President Donald Trump.  The facts in this case are as simple as they are tragic.  Witness after witness&#8212;non-partisan government employees, respected military member, even the president&#8217;s handpicked ambassador&#8212;attested to these facts.  No one has credibly refuted them.  The facts are that President Trump in his call to Ukraine President Zelensky tried to coerce Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. President Trump&#8212;in direct violation of the law and his own oath of office&#8212;used the power of the presidency for his own personal political gain.  What was the bribe he attempted to use to get cooperation from President Zelensky? It was nearly $400 million in military aid already approved by Congress and signed off on by the Pentagon and State Department. By withholding this desperately needed aid, the president undermined our ally Ukraine in the midst of their ongoing struggle with Russia. In aiding Russia and weakening Ukraine, the president also undermined our own national security.  And when President Trump got caught, the president attempted to cover up the crime and shut down any investigation by obstructing Congress, a coequal branch of government. He directly ordered White House and federal agency officers to ignore lawful subpoenas from Congress. He refused&#8212;and ordered others to refuse&#8212;to turn over documents legally requested by Congress. At every turn, the president&#8217;s response to the House&#8217;s use of its Constitutional powers of oversight was to obstruct.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The most concerning thing is that the president, despite being caught, despite being shown to violate the law, despite being impeached, continues with the scheme of convincing Ukrainian officials to smear the president&#8217;s political opponents. The crime continues.  There is overwhelming evidence that this president poses an urgent and ongoing threat to our elections, national security, and the rule of law.  In order for House Members to uphold their oaths to the Constitution, we had no alternative but to impeach the president. Our constitutional republic and democratic form of government are at stake. You can see my floor speech during House debate on articles of impeachment . Also, click here to   Funding The Government  I was glad to see the House pass robust (and bipartisan) appropriations measures this week to fund the government, and to support key progressive priorities. On healthcare alone, we&#8217;re repealing the so-called &#8220;Cadillac healthcare tax,&#8221; blocking White House sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, continuing funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and investing record amounts into medical research. We&#8217;re also raising the tobacco age to 21 and ensuring strong support for initiatives to lower the price of prescription drugs by increasing competition for generics. Budget appropriations this year also provided more than $61 billion for infrastructure investments through dedicated trust funds, $9 billion for environmental protection, and $640 million to strengthen rural broadband. We are also providing $80 billion for VA medical care, including funding to provide homelessness assistance, suicide prevention and outreach, and gender-specific care. Here at home, I was proud to help secure a record $35 million dollars for the STARBASE program, a nationwide program which supports STEM education for thousands of elementary school children each year right here in Los Alamitos at the Joint Forces Training Base. House Votes To Implement The USMCA Trade Deal  This week, I voted against , the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, which would implement the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).  I believe the bill was not ready to be voted on by the U.S. Congress. However, my Democratic colleagues and Speaker Pelosi deserve credit for their relentless focus on key priorities for American workers and consumers. Because of their efforts, the USMCA is undoubtedly stronger than the agreement President Trump put forward last year. They eliminated the agreement&#8217;s giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry and won important provisions to protect labor and environmental standards in Mexico. These include tough new enforcement mechanisms to make certain that the promises of USMCA to raise wages and improve working conditions in Mexico are realized.  It is critical to note that the agreement lacks binding, enforceable commitments to curb harmful carbon emissions. Our continent must grapple with the global climate crisis and enact bold solutions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. That is why I voted against H.R. 5430. It is vital that future trade agreements include these provisions, and I intend to push the next president to add the Paris Agreement commitments to the USMCA during their first 100 days. H.R.5430 passed the House by a vote of 385-41 and now heads to the Senate for consideration. President Trump has announced he intends to sign the bill into law if it passes the Senate. Eliminating Caps On SALT Deductions  This week, I voted to pass , the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act of 2019, which passed the House in a 218-206 vote. The bill restores the full deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) that was capped at $10,000 by the 2017 Republican Tax Law. It also enhanced above-the-line deductions for teachers and first responders to offset the out-of-pocket expenses these hardworking government employees incur to serve our communities. The Republican tax plan put a callous target on communities like ours&#8212;states and cities that have stepped into the void left by the federal government and funded essential community services like transportation, schools, and first responders. I was proud to vote to restore the SALT deduction for 2020 and 2021 to reverse the harmful tax increase the Trump Tax Law exacted from my hardworking middle-class constituents. The legislation is revenue-neutral and pays for the deduction by restoring the previous tax rate for the highest income Americans.       Congressional Foster Shadow Day 2020  Just a reminder that applications to be selected as a Foster Youth Shadow Day Delegate for the 2020 Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day Program in Washington, D.C. are due no later than December 31.  The Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Program is an opportunity for young people with personal experience in the foster care system to spend time with a Congressional representative in Washington, D.C.  I&#8217;ve been proud to participate in the program for many years, and I always look forward to meeting the delegate for the 47th District and giving them a view of what I do and how Congress works.   Those selected to participate will be representing thousands of current foster youth and alumni of foster care across the nation. Participating in the program allows current foster youth or alumni of foster care and policymakers to meet and learn from one another. Before Shadow Day, all participants will attend online trainings to prepare for their meetings with policymakers. The trainings will include an overview of federal foster care policy, community organizing and guidance on how to speak to and learn from Members of Congress about Congress while gaining &#8220;hands-on&#8221; understanding about how the U.S. government operates.  Members of Congress like me who participate in the program have the opportunity to hear and learn from the perspectives of individuals who have lived experience in the foster care system to help them as they pursue policies that impact all foster youth. Shadow Day will be in early June, 2020.       Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents asking me to support the . Below is my response to those messages: &#8220;You will be glad to know that I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. Like you, I am deeply committed to ensuring quality education is made available for all Americans.&nbsp; As a former college professor for nearly 30 years and a past chair of the California Senate Education Committee, I know firsthand how valuable education is to the long-term success of our nation.&nbsp; High-quality education is a fundamental right that should be guaranteed to all.&nbsp; The Higher Education Act has not been reauthorized in over a decade, and I am proud to support this comprehensive bill to reauthorize our federal higher education programs. The CAA would lower the cost of college, improve the quality of higher education, and expand opportunity for students for all backgrounds.&nbsp; This bill would increase investment in public colleges and universities while holding institutions and predatory, for-profit colleges accountable; increase the value of Pell Grants; and expand dual enrollment access to high school students.&nbsp; The CAA also provides relief to those seeking or currently holding student loans and makes repayment plans easier to understand.&nbsp; Lastly, the CAA also increases opportunities for low-income students and students of color by increasing funding for Minority Serving Institutions like CSU-Long Beach.  During my time in office, I have worked to support access to higher education and address student loan debt.&nbsp; I have cosponsored legislation like the Student Loan Refinancing Act, which would allow people with federal student loans to refinance at lower interest rates.  As your Representative, I will continue to work to give all our people access to education that gives students the tools and knowledge they need to succeed.&#8221;  If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.

Congress has its own version of the National Christmas Tree called the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. Also known as \"The People&#8217;s Tree,\" the Capitol Christmas Tree is placed each year on the West Front Lawn of the U.S. Capitol in celebration of the holiday season. The tradition began in 1964 when Speaker of the U.S. House, John W. McCormack (D-MA), placed a live Christmas tree on the Capitol lawn. This first Capitol Christmas Tree was a live tree that was redecorated each of the subsequent three years as the Capitol Christmas Tree before succumbing to wind and root damage after the 1967 holiday season. White pines from Maryland served as the Capitol Christmas Tree for the following two years, before the Capitol Architect decided in 1970 to obtain all future Capitol trees from various National Forests via the U.S. Forest Service.  The Capitol tree is lit in a ceremony normally presided over by the sitting Speaker of the House.  From 1990 to 2004, the tree was officially renamed the Capitol Holiday Tree, before reverting back to the original name of Capitol Christmas Tree for the 2005 season. The name has remained unchanged since 2005.  Since 1964, California National Forests have provided the Capitol Christmas Tree on four occasions--in 1986, 1993, 1995, and most recently in 2011.

This will be my last E-Newsletter of the year because the House has adjourned for the remainder of the year. I&#8217;ve also included accomplishments in 2019. Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week    Voted YES on two Articles of Impeachment  On Wednesday, the House passed two Articles of Impeachment&nbsp;against the President. The first Article accuses the President of abusing his power by withholding congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into his political rival. In doing so, the President undermined our national security and the integrity of our elections to support his own political interests. The second Article accuses the President of unprecedented obstruction of Congress by defying subpoenas and directing agencies not to cooperate with the investigation.  As I cast my vote for the Articles, I was guided by my oath of office to &#8220;support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&#8221; The Constitution is the soul of our nation, and by defending it, we are saying we will not be soulless. To review a timeline of the impeachment inquiry and related documents, visit my website.&nbsp;  Voted YES on the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act    The 2017 Republican Tax Bill took a sledgehammer to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction by limiting it to $10,000 annually for both individuals and married couples beginning in tax year 2018. Prior to this harmful cap, 194,160 of my constituents claimed an average SALT deduction of $63,083 in 2017. More than half of all taxpayers in our District claimed this credit, and half of these taxpayers earned between $75,000 and $100,000 annually.  I&#8217;ve consistently stated that capping the SALT deduction represents an assault on the middle class which is why I cosponsored and voted for the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act to eliminate the marriage penalty this year and the SALT deduction cap altogether in 2020 and 2021. The measure passed the House by a vote of 218 to 206.  Voted YES on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act  The House passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act after months of tough negotiating. Democrats secured critical changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for American workers, delivering an agreement that is stronger than the first draft of USMCA that the Trump Administration put forward.&nbsp; The USMCA now has the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any U.S. trade agreement, as well as critical victories for workers, lower prescription drug costs, and environmental protections.  Voted on Spending Bills  This week the House considered two spending bills to provide funding for the federal government for 2020. I voted &#8216;Yes&#8217; on the first spending bill, which increases funding for important investments in public health, housing, education, child care, clean energy, infrastructure, and foreign aid. Importantly, the legislation includes $25 million split between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to study the public health impacts of gun violence, the first time such funding has been provided in more than 20 years!  I voted &#8216;No&#8217; on the second spending bill because it failed to significantly reduce funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and hold them accountable for their inhumane treatment of migrants at the border. The legislation also fails to limit the Trump Administration&#8217;s ability to transfer funding from other accounts to pay for his misguided wall on the southern border. While there were other good provisions in this bill, I could not in good conscience vote for legislation that does not hold the Trump Administration accountable for cruel immigration policies.  Legislative Accomplishments of 2019  The first year of the new Democratic Majority has been highly productive. The House passed over 450 bills, with 330 of them being bipartisan. We tackled the important issues to strengthen health care, implement background checks for firearms, protect our environment, and secure election security and voter rights. Below are some highlights of the 452 bills I sponsored and cosponsored this year. Passage of 31 Bipartisan Bills by the Health Subcommittee which I Chair    On January 15, 2019, the Democratic Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee elected me as the first woman ever to serve as Chair of the Health Subcommittee. In my first year as Chairwoman, my Subcommittee passed 31 bills to:   Lower drug prices&nbsp; Strengthen the ACA Fund critical public health programs and workforce training programs End surprise billing Address the maternal health crisis End the youth e-cigarette epidemic&nbsp;  Each of the 31 bills passed by my Subcommittee received bipartisan support, either through bipartisan cosponsors or bipartisan votes in the Committee or in the full House.  My subcommittee also held 19 hearings this year, including hearings to address the broken pharmaceutical supply chain&nbsp;and examine gun violence as a public health issue.  To review a full list of the hearings and legislation we passed, click here.  Passage of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act  The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3, the&nbsp;Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;to address the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. For the first time in the history of Medicare, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be able to directly negotiate the price of the most expensive drugs in the country, including insulin. The lower prices will not only apply to Medicare beneficiaries, they will apply to everyone who has private insurance. Manufacturers will no longer be allowed to hike prices faster than the rate of inflation, and very importantly, it caps the out-of-pocket costs of seniors for their prescription drugs at $2,000 annually. Among several significant policies, the&nbsp;Lower Drug Costs Now Act:   Lowers drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for all Americans&nbsp;by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug companies. The lower prices and cost-sharing will apply to Medicare and ALL private insurance plans.   Stops drug price hikes&nbsp;by requiring manufacturers who raise the price of any drug that is covered by Medicare (including generics) above the rate of inflation to lower the price or pay the entire price above inflation back to the government.   Limits out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs&nbsp;for Medicare beneficiaries. For the first time in the history of the Medicare Part D program every senior will have their out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000. Today, some seniors pay up to $5,100 in out-of-pocket costs and some pay more.   Increases NIH funding&nbsp;to research and develop new cures. It provides $2.895 billion for the FDA to ensure the safety of our drugs; invests in our community health centers; and directs $10 billion to address the opioid crisis.   Adds vision, hearing, and dental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as colonoscopies and lymphedema treatment.  Passage of a Resolution to Recognize the Armenian Genocide   After fighting for 27 years to end the official U.S. silence regarding the first genocide of the 20th century, I led the effort to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide, and the House passed a resolution to do so on a bipartisan vote. Between 1915 and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians, and hundreds of thousands of Assyrians, Greeks, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. There is a historic parallel today as Turkey is once again engaging in ethnic cleansing, this time against the Kurds in Syria. The resolution we passed not only honors and commemorates my Armenian and Assyrian ancestors and all those who perished in the first genocide of the 20th century, but it also serves as a timely reminder that we must remain vigilant to prevent similar atrocities today. 100+ years of official U.S. silence ended on October 29th with a bipartisan vote of 405 to 11. The Senate passed the Resolution last week on December 12th. The U.S. has now joined the 49 U.S. states and over 2 dozen countries, including 14 NATO allies, that have passed Armenian Genocide resolutions.  Introduction of the Online Privacy Act, the Strongest Privacy Bill in Congress  Every American is vulnerable to privacy violations with few tools to defend themselves. Too often, our private information online is stolen, abused, used for profit, or grossly mishandled. In November, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA-19) joined me to introduce the&nbsp;Online Privacy Act. Our legislation secures individuals&#8217; privacy, encourages innovation, and restores trust in technology companies. It protects our privacy by:   Creating User Rights &#8211;&nbsp;The bill grants every American the right to access, correct, or delete their data. It also creates new rights, like the right to impermanence, which lets users decide how long companies can keep their data.   Placing Clear Obligations on Companies&nbsp;&#8211; The bill minimizes the amount of data companies collect, process, disclose, and maintain, and bars companies from using data in discriminatory ways. Additionally, companies must receive consent from users in plain, simple language.   Establishing a Digital Privacy Agency (DPA)&nbsp;&#8211; The bill establishes an independent agency led by a Director that&#8217;s appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. The DPA will enforce privacy protections and investigate abuses.   Strengthening Enforcement&nbsp;&#8211; The bill empowers state attorneys general to enforce violations of the bill and allows individuals to appoint nonprofits to represent them in private class action lawsuits.  Our bill received strong endorsements from public interest organizations, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) ranked our bill the strongest of nine privacy bills in Congress.  Passage of the Presidential Tax Transparency Act as a part of H.R. 1, the For the People Act  The House passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act, to restore trust in our government. The legislation addresses corruption, strengthens our democracy, and returns power to the people of our country. I&#8217;m proud to have one of my bills included in H.R. 1 that requires sitting presidents, vice presidents, and major party nominees for both offices to disclose their 10 most recent federal income tax returns to the public. Presidents and presidential candidates should be required by law to inform the American people of their finances so we can determine who will best make decisions in the interest of our country.  Passage of the TRACED Act to End the Scourge of Robocalls  Americans received an unfathomable 48 billion robocalls last year and a near-record 5.5 billion calls in October of this year, but relief is on the way! The House and Senate passed the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act. The bill will bring much needed relief to all of us who are subjected to abusive robocall practices. This legislation requires that phone carriers implement call authentication technology and offer call blocking services to consumers at no additional charge. Importantly, it requires the FCC to enact safeguards so companies cannot abuse robocall exemptions, and ensures the FCC has the authority and the tools to take strong, quick action when it tracks down robocallers. The bill awaits the President&#8217;s signature. Three of My Health Bills Passed the House, Two of Them Were Signed into Law  Pandemic and All-Hazards Advancing Innovation Act  My bipartisan Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA) was signed into law to strengthen and improve U.S. national preparedness and response for public health emergencies, including infectious diseases such as Ebola and measles, natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, and manmade disasters. The legislation provides essential funding to bolster our defenses against bioterrorism and public health emergencies.  ACE Kids Act  My bipartisan legislation with Reps. Castor, Bilirakis, and Herrera Beutler, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (ACE Kids Act), was signed into law to improve how care is delivered to America&#8217;s children with complex medical conditions on Medicaid. The legislation allows states to opt into a new Medicaid program which will provide complete wrap-around healthcare services for the nation&#8217;s sickest children. The ACE Kids Act aims to better coordinate this care while reducing overall Medicaid spending by creating a Medicaid care coordination program. This legislation is based on existing programs that save money by decreasing hospital visits and improving care. Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital was a sterling partner in this effort.  Purple Book Continuity Act  The House unanimously passed my bipartisan Purple Book Continuity Act to make drugs more affordable by bringing transparency to the current patent system. The legislation implements transparency reforms to the Purple Book, a document created by the Food and Drug Administration, which manufacturers use when considering where to invest their research and development dollars. Under my legislation, the Purple Book will be updated more routinely and be made available easily online, informing manufacturers of brand-name biological drug patents that are expiring. This will encourage manufacturers to develop alternatives to high cost drugs, adding pricing pressure to the drug market and saving patients money.  Passage of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act  The House passed my bipartisan legislation that increases efficiency of federal data centers. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act directs the Executive branch to harness information and communications technologies to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use within the federal government.  As the nation&#8217;s largest energy user, landowner, and employer, the federal government should lead by example to improve the energy efficiency of its technology equipment and data centers. This legislation will reduce the federal government&#8217;s energy use, save taxpayer dollars, and set the standard for the private sector. This legislation is still awaiting a vote in the Senate and I look forward to them taking this up in 2020.  Passage of Key Provisions of the TRUE Fees Act  Cable companies pocket an estimated $28 billion a year from the American people by advertising one price to customers and then tacking on confusing charges and hidden fees to their bills. Congress passed key provisions from my TRUE Fees Act which requires cable and satellite TV providers to disclose an &#8216;all-in&#8217; price to consumers, including fees and taxes, before consumers sign up for a service; requires that consumers receive a formal notice of fees and &#8216;all-in&#8217; prices within 24 hours of signing up for a service; and grants consumers 24 hours to cancel after receiving formal notice of fees, without penalty.  Passage of the Save the Internet Act  The House passed the&nbsp;Save the Internet Act&nbsp;to restore bipartisan net neutrality protections for consumers and small businesses. The legislation reverses the Trump Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s (FCC) wrong-headed repeal of critical net neutrality protections in late 2017.&nbsp; Since the FCC&#8217;s decision to end net neutrality, control of the Internet has been taken from the American people and handed over to Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, empowering them to generate new profits by restricting access.  The&nbsp;Save the Internet Act&nbsp;is a simple, but powerful three-page bill that wrests control from ISPs and restores the internet as an open platform for content, speech, and information. The Internet is one of the greatest communication networks in human history and an American invention. It&#8217;s our responsibility to protect it as a force to drive innovation, expand our economy, and promote free speech in our democracy. Watch my floor speech on the&nbsp;Save the Internet Act&nbsp;here.  Constituent Outreach  Town Hall Meetings  I held 15 Telephone Town Hall Meetings and six in-person Town Hall Meetings throughout our District to give constituents the opportunity to ask me questions and voice their concerns. Thousands of constituents participated in to our Tele-Town Hall Meetings and our in-person Town Hall Meetings. With each Town Hall Meeting, I'm inspired by the deep sense of patriotism of my constituents, and that together we can keep our country a beacon of hope and freedom.  Mail  In the first year of the 116th Congress, my office received over 115,000 letters, phone calls, and email from constituents about issues they care about. I appreciate the time constituents take to write to me, and I want you to know that I personally read and respond to every letter my constituents send to me. I never put out &#8216;group letters&#8217; or &#8216;canned mail&#8217; and I don&#8217;t plan to. I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas.  ---------  2019 has been a historic year in Congress. It has been stressful and it has been productive and there&#8217;s much work to do in 2020. Whether it&#8217;s working to meet the challenges of climate change; ensure Americans have access to affordable health insurance; bring down the cost of prescription drugs; strengthen our privacy rights; protect our environment; or save the free and open Internet, I will continue to be an outspoken champion for my constituents and advance impactful legislation in the second year of the 116th Congress.  Should you have any questions or comments, let me hear from you. I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas. May the New Year be filled with every blessing for you, your family, and our country. It is an honor to represent you and I pledge to continue advancing policies that will strengthen our democracy, our people, our economy, and our values.  With great gratitude,   Anna G.

You might remember that back in November, we finally secured key Republican support for the coal miners' pension and healthcare legislation that I&#8217;ve been fighting for years to pass through the Senate. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 would shore up the 1974 United Mine Workers of America Pension Plan &#150; which is currently headed for insolvency due to coal company bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis &#150; and ensure that retired miners and their families do not lose their healthcare due to coal company bankruptcies over the last two years.  I&#8217;m pleased to tell you that, working with congressional leaders from both parties, we were able to get the Bipartisan American Miners Act included in the end-of-year spending bill the Senate will be voting on this week. By passing this bipartisan bill, Congress will protect the pensions of 92,000 coal miners and families, and protect healthcare benefits for 13,000 miners &#150; including hundreds of retirees in Southwest Virginia whose health benefits were expected to expire this month after the bankruptcy of Westmoreland Coal in October 2018.    None of this would have been possible without the hard work and leadership of the United Mine Workers of America, who made literally dozens if not hundreds of trips to Washington to make the case to my colleagues for this important fix. I&#8217;m proud to have worked with them, and with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), for years to turn this bill into a reality.

We have finally honored the promise this country made to our coal miners back in 1946 and secured the health care and pension benefits they earned through a lifetime of hard work.&nbsp;  &#xa0;  My Bipartisan American Miners Act has been included in the final funding package that will keep the government open beyond December 20th when the current temporary funding measure expires. It guarantees lifetime health care benefits for the 13,000 miners who would have lost their benefits entirely and the 92,000 miners who would have seen their pensions gutted next year without Congressional action. &#xa0;  This would not have happened without the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) and the thousands of coal miners who invested their time and energy, year after year, coming to Washington, walking the halls, and fighting for their brothers and sisters. It has been the honor of my life to lead this fight and bring together the coalition that made this possible. I also want to thank my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, for making this a truly bipartisan effort.&nbsp; &#xa0;  By working together across party lines, since 2016, we have been able to secure lifetime healthcare benefits for 36,000 and pensions for 92,000&nbsp;miners and their families. This should be a reminder to us all that we can make this country better when we put partisan politics aside and focus on fixing the real problems facing the people we are here to represent.&nbsp;  &#xa0;    With warmest regards,   Joe Manchin III United States Senator   JM/ace  &nbsp; &nbsp; To receive updates on Congress, please sign up to receive regular e-Newsletters from my office.

As we enter these final days of 2019, here is a review of the work done this week for AZ-06.&nbsp;  USMCA is Coming to Town   We have been working for over a year to move this modernized trade agreement across the finish line. While bipartisan support for this agreement has been in place for many months, I am pleased to see Speaker Pelosi will finally allow this job creating agreement to come to the House Floor for a vote. Every day we delayed this vote only cost us more American jobs, the ability to sell American products into neighboring countries, and a stronger economy.&nbsp;  Arizona knows the importance of cross-border trade, particularly with Mexico, our state&#8217;s largest trading partner. This agreement will ensure our manufacturers are being supported, our border is being provided much needed resources necessary to protect our environment and will support the over 228,300 jobs supported by trade&nbsp; in our state.  This trade agreement is a win for all Americans, and I look forward to seeing this be implemented for all industries who have long looked to further their success in our booming economy  Social Security Scam Calls The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been made aware of thousands of Arizonans receiving scam calls regarding problems with taxpayers accounts and the need for information.&nbsp;  If you receive a call stating there is a problem with your Social Security account or number, follow this steps:&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. HANG up your phone  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. DO NOT provide the caller with access to bank accounts or your personal information&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. REPORT the call to the Social Security Administration  The SSA will always issue written correspondence about any account problems or discrepancies. If you have any further questions, please always feel welcome to reach out to our Scottsdale Office at (480) 946-2411.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Partisanship for Prescription Drugs   This week&#8217;s floor activity focused on the dangerous price importation model embedded in Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s partisan drug pricing plan, HR 3. I joined general debate with my colleagues to explain my opposition to this plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;  My Democratic colleagues want to assign a value to lives that would stop close to 100 innovative cures being developed. Everyone agrees that we need to fight for lower drug costs but allowing government to control the value of your health while reducing incentives for vital research funding is not the answer.  The Republican&#8217;s offered a bipartisan solution, H.R. 19, that was supported by several Democrats. We worked together the last 6 months to create this bipartisan legislation that could come into law today, however my Democratic colleagues voted it down. To watch me explain the harmful effects of the Democrat&#8217;s proposal, click the photo&nbsp;above. Constituent Spotlight&nbsp;   We had the pleasure of welcoming Arita, an AZ-06 constituent, into our office this week to hear her story. Arita has a very rare liver disease that has severely affected her health.&nbsp;However, she has never let it stand in the way of her pursuing her dreams. While overcoming the disease, Arita was able to play lacrosse at Stanford University and is now pursuing her Master's Degree there.&nbsp; We discussed the technology disruptions we are seeing right now in healthcare and the importance of investing in curative drugs to help save our brothers and sisters with lifelong conditions.&nbsp;  Arita also has taken an interest in Valley Fever and what work we can be doing to help cure this disease. We also discussed the FORWARD Act, legislation that I have introduced this Congress to help finance research for a cure.&nbsp; Thank you for coming in to share your inspiring story, Arita. Your positive attitude and passion to help others in inspiring.&nbsp;  Wreaths Across America   Our staff joined Arizonans at the annual Wreaths Across America to honor our fallen military members. The event was held at the Arizona National Memorial Cemetery this year and had a great turn out.&nbsp;  Thank you to all of our military members and family for your dedication to our country. We must always honor our military and remember the fallen who did not return home in the fight to keep our nation safe.

Hello all,&nbsp; This past weekend we logged our 12th town hall since I&#8217;ve been sworn into Congress. Thanks so much to the constituents who have come out this past year to ask questions, challenge me on issues and generally participate in Democracy. This is tough time with too much division in America. I&#8217;m proud that over the past year that we&#8217;ve come together each month to look for that common ground, and when we have disagreed we have done so with civility and respect for one another all the same. Thank you for the honor of representing you. This week in Washington, I was proud to see so many key legislative priorities that I cosponsored move through the House. I was honored to vote to pass HR 3, the Elijah E.&nbsp;Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a bill that would end the ban on Medicare negotiating prescription drug prices and invest in innovation for NIH research. Prescription drug costs are one of the top issues I hear about from my constituents, and this bill takes a historic step toward making affordable healthcare a reality for every Minnesota family. I am also very proud to announce that after working hard with the Administration and House leaders, we have reached a final deal on the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement for American workers and family farmers. I worked hard to make sure this trade agreement did not include its original text that was a handout to Big Pharma&nbsp;and that we included&nbsp;enforcement of labor standards in Mexico. I look forward to voting for this agreement when it comes to the House floor.&nbsp; Additionally, a bipartisan bill to strengthen our nation&#8217;s farm workforce passed out of the House, and I introduced a bipartisan bill to tackle government waste by implementing processes to address improper government payments and save taxpayers billions of dollars each year. In Washington  Supporting family farmers: This week, the House voted to pass a bill I cosponsored to strengthen our farm workforce. I&#8217;ve heard from farmers across Minnesota about how this bill would help them fill needed jobs on the farm, and I&#8217;m proud to pass this common-sense bipartisan bill for family farmers. Learn more here.&nbsp; Family leave for federal workers: This week, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act to fund the Department of Defense. I was proud to see paid family leave for all federal workers included in the bill. Paid family leave should be part of every workforce. Meeting with students: It was wonderful to have exchange students from Minnesota stop by the office this week! Thanks for making Minnesota your home away from home and for all your wonderful questions about making Congress work for Minnesotans.    Lowering drug costs: This week, I proudly voted for the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act to lower prescription drug costs for hard working Minnesotans in CD2. Passing HR3 would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and extend those prices to private plans. Minnesotans can&#8217;t wait for action on drug prices when lives are on the line. You can read more about my support for this bill in an op-ed I wrote with Rep. Dean Phillips.&nbsp; Making government work for you: I came to Washington to make government work for Minnesota families, so when I learned that the federal government makes hundreds of billions of dollars of improper payments, I introduced a bill to save taxpayer money. Rep Cheri Bustos, Rep. Mark Meadows and Rep. Greg Gianforte and I introduced a bipartisan bill to cut down on the federal government&#8217;s improper payments, because hard-working Minnesotans deserve to have their tax dollars managed more responsibly.&nbsp; Read more here.  Supporting student leaders: Thanks to the dedicated student leaders from the University of Minnesota&#8217;s student government for visiting the office this past week to talk to me about making higher education more affordable and accessible for Minnesotans!    Fighting for Minnesotans: Minnesotans deserve a government that works for them - that&#8217;s why I sent a letter to House leadership urging action on key priorities for working families like lowering prescription drug costs, fully funding special education and expanding rural broadband. Read more here.&nbsp;  Securing a final trade deal: After working with the administration to ensure the new US-Mexico-Canada Trade agreement protected American workers and did not raise drug prices, I&#8217;m proud to announce we have reached a final agreement that supports farmers and bolsters our economy. I plan to vote yes on USMCA.    &nbsp;  In the district  Honoring student performers: Every town hall, we have one of Minnesota&#8217;s talented student choirs perform the National Anthem. This past weekend, while we met constituents in West St. Paul, we had the South St. Paul High School Varsity Singers and students from West St. Paul&#8217;s Heritage EStem Middle School band with Let it Snow!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;                   District Office:12940 Harriet Ave S.

Senator Romney also took part in the White House&nbsp;Child Care &amp; Paid Leave Summit, where he advocated for his paid family leave proposal. Keep scrolling for more details on the Senator's week:           The bipartisan, bicameral health care agreement reached this week includes provisions&nbsp;from the Smoke-Free Schools Act and the Tobacco to 21 Act&nbsp; - legislation backed by Senator Romney - to address the youth vaping crisis. The Senator has led efforts to reverse this epidemic, repeatedly raising the issue in HELP Committee hearings, meetings with the president, and with the FDA nominee during his confirmation process. He released the following statement: &#8220;While our work is far from finished, I&#8217;m encouraged that the health care deal takes a significant step to address the youth vaping crisis by raising the federal smoking age to 21 nationwide and banning the use of e-cigarettes in schools... [T]he Administration and Congress must act further to ban flavors that appeal to kids and prevent vaping cartridges from being adulterated with harmful substances.&#8221;    The Department of Homeland Security's proposed 500% fee increase on family history records obtained would greatly inhibit Utahns' access to these records. In a letter to DHS officials, the Senator expressed his concern and requested justification for this fee increase. Senator Romney&nbsp;spoke to KSL's Boyd Matheson about the issue. Click below to&nbsp;listen.   &#8220;When the Genealogy Program began in 2008, its initial fees ranged from just $20 to $35. In 2016, USCIS raised both fees to $65. DHS&#8217;s proposed rule would raise the search fee 269% from $65 to $240, and the records fee 492% from $65 to $385. If this rule takes effect, a family historian would need to pay $625 to search and obtain a single file on a relative.&#8221;    Full story by Matthew Brown here.   Senator Romney joined Senators Cotton (R-AR), Blackburn (R-TN), Cornyn (R-TX), Cruz (R-TX), Graham (R-SC), Hawley (R-MO), Perdue (R-GA), and Sasse (R-NE) to introduce the Significant Transnational Criminal Organization Designation Act -&nbsp;legislation that would subject certain foreign criminal organizations like drug cartels to sanctions, including immigration, financial, and criminal penalties. The Senator said, \"This legislation will better equip us to meet the threats our nation faces from violent cartels and...also requires the president to submit a full report to Congress regarding the horrific attacks against Americans in Mexico last month, including whether the organization responsible should be designated as a Significant Transnational Criminal Organization and sanctioned under our legislation.&#8221;    Full story by Nate Carlisle here.   It's past time for the U.S. to construct a comprehensive strategy to confront China's growing aggression. This week, Senator Romney made headway on three pieces of legislation that help meet this goal. The final version of the annual defense authorization bill includes&nbsp;provisions from the Huawei Prohibition Act of 2019, which would ensure Huawei is not removed from the entities list until it no longer poses a threat to national security. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved&nbsp;Senator Romney's Indo-Pacific Cooperation Act of 2019,&nbsp;requiring the U.S. to partner with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, Europe, and elsewhere, to develop a unified approach to address the rise of China. Senator Romney also joined Senators Warren (D-MA), Cotton (R-AR), and Kaine (D-VA) in writing a letter to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper&nbsp;raising concerns about the national security risks posed by U.S. reliance on foreign-manufactured pharmaceutical products.&nbsp;The&nbsp;letter follows the publication of a new&nbsp;report that warns of America's \"growing reliance\" on products primarily made in China that are critical to drug manufacturing.   Senator Romney joined several colleagues at the White House's Child Care &amp; Paid Leave Summit to discuss&nbsp;their efforts in finding solutions to provide paid family leave for American families. In March, the Senator teamed up with Senator Rubio (R-FL) to introduce the New Parents Act, which would allow new parents to use a portion of their Social Security after the birth or adoption of a child.&nbsp;     Levied on everything from pacemakers to defibrillators and surgical tools, the medical device tax hurts patients and stifles medical innovation. Senator Romney met with representatives from GE Healthcare, which manufactures products in Salt Lake City, about the need to repeal the medical device tax, which is slated to resume in January 2020 unless Congress acts.     If we don't act now to address the solvency of programs like Medicare and Social Security, our government's trust funds will be depleted in 13 years. Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, published an op-ed praising Senator Romney's legislation - the&nbsp;TRUST Act&nbsp;- to create a process to rescue these programs that millions of Americans rely on.

The most important message I want to share with you is that the House of Representatives is continuing its work governing and passing an agenda on behalf of the American people.  Last week, we voted to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4) to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full strength. The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision six years ago to gut the Voting Rights Act was disgraceful, and last week&#8217;s vote is a step to prevent egregious voter suppression tactics. On the agenda this week is the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3), which would finally allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs, make prescription medication more affordable, while also &nbsp;saving American taxpayers nearly $500 billion. Included in the bill are several provisions I introduced to extend pre-existing condition protections and help fill critically-needed healthcare jobs. We are also hopefully making fast progress towards addressing the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, reaching agreement on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), and passing legislation to fund the government for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2020. On a personal level, last week I was joined by 150 colleagues as original cosponsor of my resolution condemning the Trump Administration's recent start of formal withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.  It is important to repeat that the House of Representatives has passed more than 400 bills in 2019, with more than 275 receiving bipartisan support.&nbsp; Astonishingly, the Senate, and more specifically Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, are simply refusing to consider the vast majority of these bills. these bills.  Finally, while much important work continues on the floor of the House, the impeachment inquiry is also proceeding apace. This week, the House Judiciary Committee is holding additional hearings as it begins drafting formal articles of impeachment. The two most consequential votes Representatives can take are on deciding to commit our nation to war and impeaching the President.&nbsp; I take these Constitutional responsibilities extremely seriously and will make my decision fully understanding the gravity of the moment.&nbsp; My promise to you is that I &nbsp;will closely review the articles that the Committee presents, follow the facts, and dutifully uphold my oath of office.  &nbsp;  HOLIDAY CARDS FOR HEROES &#8211; DEADLINE FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13    We are again inviting the entire Tenth District to participate in our annual Holiday Cards for Heroes. You can drop off cards for military servicemembers who will spend the holidays stationed far from home. A personal, handwritten card is a much-appreciated way to say thank you to the Americans serving our country, offer words of encouragement, and share holiday cheer. Thank you for participating!  Please drop off at our district office in Lincolnshire (111 Barclay Blvd, Suite 200, Lincolnshire, IL 60069) or at any of our Neighborhood Office Hours before end of day Friday, December 13.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  LEADING 150 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING WITHDRAWAL FROM PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT            VIDEO: Schneider speaks on House Floor on his Paris Climate Resolution   Last week I introduced H. Res 743, articulating the sense of Congress condemning the Trump Administration&#8217;s decision to withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. I was proud to be joined by more than 150 of my colleagues as original co-sponsors. The resolution was introduced after the Trump Administration recently began the formal withdrawal process to remove the United States from the pact that seeks to limit the increase in global temperatures to less than two degrees Celsius. It also coincides with the ongoing 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP25.  At this crucial moment, the Trump Administration is ceding American leadership on climate and actively undermining critical efforts to curb emissions and transition to a clean energy economy. As countries around the world meet in Madrid, our resolution is intended to send a strong message that the U.S House of Representatives condemns the President&#8217;s decision to abandon the climate agreement, and stands ready to fulfill the commitments that we made under the Paris Agreement.    &nbsp;  EPA BEGINS PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ON ETHYLENE OXIDE  I was relieved to learn last week that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at last issued Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit feedback from the public on strategies to reduce ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions from commercial sterilization and fumigation operations.  After months of foot dragging, the U.S. EPA is finally seeking input from our communities on ethylene oxide. But this announcement does not excuse the agency&#8217;s long dereliction of duty on this issue, and we still have no firm deadline for this critically-needed final rule. This public comment period is an important opportunity for our communities to make their voices heard, and I hope Tenth District residents will engage in the process. Our new bipartisan congressional task force plans to make public comments and will continue to keep pressure on the U.S. EPA to do its job. I will not stop fighting to keep the air my constituents breathe safe and free from harmful chemicals.    &nbsp;  CENSUS 2020 HIRING FAIR IN NORTH CHICAGO  Please note, the 2020 Census is still hiring. A job fair is upcoming on December 18 in North Chicago:    NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS  Our constituent service representatives hold  in communities across the Tenth District to more easily meet with constituents about any casework needs. My team will be in Waukegan, Des Plaines, and Prospect Heights this week. If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!  &nbsp;  WEEKLY WRAP-UP  &nbsp;    Last Thursday, I was joined by more than 4,500 constituents for our most recent telephone town hall. We had questions on prescriptions drug costs, the USMCA trade agreement, lowering student loan debt, bipartisanship, opioids, and more.&nbsp; I know we scheduled the call just before the Bears game, and I appreciate the team waiting until the second quarter to light up the score board and bring home the win.  &nbsp;    On Saturday, we held our 13th Congress on Your Corner town hall of the year in Vernon Hills. We had more than 100 people join in the High School auditorium for a vibrant, but respectful conversation on issues raging from impeachment to immigration to fighting the growing tide of antisemitism in the US and globally.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m so grateful for everyone who has joined us at one of our 13 Congress On Your Corner town halls in 2019 and am looking forward to continuing the conversations across our district in 2020!  &nbsp;   Over the weekend, I participated in a fascinating visit to Mitsubishi Electric Automation in Vernon Hills with our Tenth District #STEMScholar class of high school students!  &nbsp;   I also had a wonderful visit with the 8th grade social studies class at Daniel Webster Middle School in Waukegan.

Continue reading this brief update to learn more about my work on your behalf last week.  Stopping Robocalls  Robocalls have become more than just a nuisance. They are a tool for scammers to prey upon the most vulnerable in our society, the elderly and disabled. Illegal robocalls perpetuate fraud, threaten personal privacy, and undermine our telecommunications system. Last week, a bill I helped create to fight the plague of robocalls passed the House. I believe it will go a long way in giving the FCC the tools it needs to prosecute these scammers and shutdown illegal robocall operations. My hope is that my Senate colleagues will expedite the bill's passage and it will go to the President to become law very soon.  Advocating for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  The suicide crisis is a multi-faceted national crisis - not a Veteran-specific one - and it is going to take a government and society wide effort to solve it. Since only six of the 20 servicemembers and Veterans per day who are taking their lives are receiving healthcare services at VA, we must empower VA to work with community partners to reach those most in need. Sadly, during last week&#8217;s VA Committee Markup, Chairman Takano missed the opportunity to work in a bipartisan manner with our bill, the IMPROVE Act, which was originally designed as a bipartisan measure to help achieve this important goal. While I appreciate the Chairman&#8217;s intent and know that we have a common goal, by pushing a partisan substitute amendment he has made it much less likely that the IMPROVE Act will garner the bipartisan support it would need to pass the Senate. This is extremely disappointing and could have negative consequences for our nation&#8217;s heroes. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my comments during the hearing. Despite this setback, I remain hopeful that we can work together in the coming weeks to do the right thing for Veterans. To learn more about the IMPROVE Act, as originally introduced, click here. Additionally, last week my team had the opportunity to visit the construction site of the future VA Outpatient Clinic on Little Road in New Port Richey. During the visit, my team was able to talk with the fine folks who are working hard to make the dream of this new, expanded clinic a reality. According to the project foreman: the grading, cutting, and balancing of the earth is almost complete. Within the next few days, his crew will begin working on the building's foundation. It is exciting to see this important project finally come to fruition, as the new facility will allow more Veterans to receive quality care closer to home.   Helping Seniors  Last week, I reintroduced the Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act of 2019 (H.R. 5333). This legislation will help millions of seniors on Medicare by ensuring more timely access to the treatments they need. Additionally, there are more than 600 medical device companies in our state working to develop innovative and effective products. During a roundtable discussion in my district, I heard from many of these businesses about how these lengthy and unnecessary Medicare coverage delays create a significant barrier in bringing new products to market. This bill is about connecting patients with important devices and technologies more quickly. Additionally, it is about encouraging innovation rather than stifling it. Government has to get out of the way and streamline the payment process for effective new devices that can ultimately help improve and save lives.  Specifically, this bill will guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to cutting-edge medical innovation by streamlining the coverage determination process and improving the availability of breakthrough devices for patients. Currently, Medicare does not automatically cover the latest advances in medical technology, even when the products are approved through the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (FDA) breakthrough pathway process. Medicare&#8217;s coverage determination for FDA approved products can take up to three years, delaying vital treatments to millions of seniors. The Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act would require Medicare to temporarily cover all breakthrough products approved through the FDA&#8217;s breakthrough pathway for a three-year period, during which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must make a permanent coverage determination.&nbsp; Facilitating Financial Success  Despite slowing growth around the world, last week&#8217;s Jobs Report shows that the U.S. economy remains a bright spot, thanks to lower taxes and fewer burdensome regulations. Watch this&nbsp;video to learn more. &nbsp;  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following message from a constituent after her father&#8217;s passport was stolen while he was visiting Paris.  &#8220;Thank you, Kristen and Tucker of Representative Bilirakis&#8217;s office in Pinellas County. Dad is now able to come home! These ladies made sure a temporary passport was being processed before they left (LATE) on Thanksgiving break! You&#8217;re America&#8217;s finest and we could not have done it without you!&#8221; This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team enjoyed the YMCA Suncoast West Pasco Prayer Breakfast last week. It is wonderful to see so many leaders praying for our community.   I&#8217;m very excited that my team had the opportunity to begin an important conversation with the leaders of Dunedin Elementary School and Dunedin City Commissioner Deborah Kynes about a potential mental health pilot project that will provide additional services for at risk youth. It is my belief that early intervention can make a tremendous difference.   My team also enjoyed participating in last week's graduation ceremony from the transition preparation program at the Zephyrhills Correctional Institute. This voluntary program prepares inmates who are about to be released for successful reintegration into society. This program has proven effective in reducing recidivism.   My team was delighted to participate in the Zephyrhills Chamber of Commerce annual Christmas breakfast last week. The Saint Leo Chorus did an outstanding job performing for the group of community leaders.  My team was honored to participate in the Alliance for Substance Addiction Prevention (ASAP)'s annual brunch to celebrate the progress being made in Pasco County. Did you know that over the last year, Pasco moved from having the 5th highest drug overdose death rate in the state of Florida to the 10th? This is largely due to the fact that Pasco first responders are using Narcan more frequently. Narcan helps prevent death in cases of opioid overdose. Last year, Narcan was used 900 times by first responders in Pasco County. We still have work to do in terms of improving access to treatment, but it is important to recognize the collaborative effort of our community partners as they work to combat addiction.   Additionally, my team was pleased to participate in the Hillsborough County Medical Association's annual legislative advocacy luncheon to learn more about the issues impacting the medical community and the needs of patients.

JDRF One Walk&nbsp; This month, I walked in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) One Walk at Segra Park. I am grateful to be able to support such an important cause and walk with my community in support of one day eradicating type 1 diabetes. In addition to discussing how I can work to end this disease, I also discussed my work in Congress with our community.&nbsp; The JDRF One Walk supports life-changing research that give hope to those impacted by type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that strikes suddenly and is serious and stressful to manage. Currently, there is nothing that can prevent type 1 diabetes and there is no cure. JDRF is a leader in funding type 1 diabetes research, motivated by their vision of a world without type 1 diabetes. This organization works tirelessly to improve the lives of those affected by this disease by accelerating life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent, and treat type 1 diabetes and its complications.

The committee's bipartisan vote represented an important step towards energy efficiency, and lasting protections for our public lands. Which bills passed our committee?&nbsp;The Restore Our Parks Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&#150; a&nbsp;top priority of mine as ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;addresses the $12 billion maintenance backlog for our national parks; the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Support Act, which would reduce energy costs and boost Maine's economy; and legislation to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  What happens next?&nbsp;The bills will advance to the Senate floor and await consideration.  Scenes from Maine  \"Stuff the Bus\" for Preble Street 2019  We had a great turnout to the \"Stuff the Bus\" event for Preble Street in Portland over Thanksgiving week! A reminder that this season isn&#8217;t just about giving thanks for what you have; it&#8217;s about sharing our blessings with others.     Honoring our Service Members on Veterans Day 2019 This Veterans Day, it was my privilege to honor all the men and women who answered the call to serve in defense of our nation. I traveled across Maine to thank the Maine veterans who sacrificed to ensure our freedoms &#151; they truly represent the best of America. Here are some snapshots of the day:   Great way to begin the day: the Martin&#8217;s Point Veterans Day Breakfast, where I joined Portland community members and healthcare providers to honor the service of Maine veterans, their caregivers, and their families.   The Fisher House on the Togus VA Medical Center campus&nbsp; provides a home for veterans and their families while they seek treatment and recover. Healing can be a long process, and it&#8217;s vital to have your support network close by.  Open Enrollment Event in Portland   On the opening day of the Open Enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), I joined healthcare providers and advocates to urge Maine people to sign up for health insurance for 2020. As you read this, there are less than two weeks left to sign up&nbsp;&#150; there's really no time to waste &#150; get your coverage today! With Less Than Two Weeks Left to Sign-Up, Register for Healthcare Today! Senator King's column appeared in the Times Record&nbsp;and the Mount Desert Islander.  As winter approaches, Maine people are busy preparing for low temperatures, high snowfalls, and a holiday season that seems to grow a little longer each year. With so much to do (and shorter days making it even harder to get it all done), I know how easy it is for something important to slip through the cracks &#150; which is why I&#8217;m writing today to remind you that the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s (ACA) Open Enrollment period is open for approximately 2 more weeks, ending on December 15th. You can sign up by visiting .  In the event of an unexpected illness or injury, insurance can save you from medical or financial ruin. With such a short window to secure critical coverage, there&#8217;s no time to put this off. December 15th will be here before you know it. This holiday season, give yourself and loved ones the gift of peace of mind, and find the best healthcare plan that keeps you healthy both physically and financially. &nbsp;   Land Conservation Assistance Network (LandCAN)  Maine&#8217;s forests are among our state&#8217;s greatest natural assets, and we need to maximize their present and future value to Maine people.

Visit to Riverview Health&nbsp;Construction Site Today, the Indiana/Kentucky Chapter of the Associated Builders and Contractors showed me a construction site in central Indiana where Riverview Hospital is seeking to lower healthcare costs by reducing ER visits for non-emergency treatment.&nbsp;We had a great discussion on the need to pass the Fair and Open Competition Act so we can save taxpayer dollars and restore competition on federal construction projects.&nbsp;       Huntington&#8217;s Disease Society of America Huntington&#8217;s disease is a fatal genetic disorder resulting in the deterioration of nerve cells in the brain. With some estimates showing that this disease effects one in every 10,000 people in the United States, it is important that Congress continues to support funding and research initiatives to improve diagnosis and treatment. This morning, I met with some Hoosier representatives of the Huntington&#8217;s Disease Society of America to learn more about how we can help.&nbsp;    Thankful for our Troops I hope all Hoosiers had a happy Thanksgiving. This year, America has a lot to be thankful for. We remain a country of unprecedented prosperity and enduring freedom, founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is only made possible by the brave men and women who are currently overseas, defending the freedoms we so cherish. Because some of these brave Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines who were not able to be home this Thanksgiving, I want to especially recognize their daily sacrifices, and the sacrifices of their families, that allow us to remain safe and secure in our great nation.&nbsp;    Bill to Designate Ernest &#8216;Ernie&#8217; T. Pyle Post Office Ernie Pyle used his talents to document the everyday service member&#8217;s courage and sacrifice while reporting alongside units in WWII. To recognize his service to our country, I recently introduced a resolution along with Senator Braun to rename a post office in Dana, Indiana, after Ernie Pyle. Learn more here.   Remembering Indy Star Columnist Mathew Tully&nbsp; Stomach cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and one of the most difficult to detect in its early stages. This year, more than 27,000 cases of stomach cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and more than 11,000 Americans will lose their battle with the disease. I recently introduced a resolution to honor Indy Star columnist Mathew Tully and make November 2019 Stomach Cancer Awareness Month. In one of his final columns, Matt said his goal was to &#8216;spark conversations and offer a unique perspective.&#8217; He did far more than that. Through the words he wrote, Matt brought communities together, shined a bright light on the problems we faced, and called attention to the everyday Hoosiers who were trying to make life better. It is my hope that this resolution will spark conversations about stomach cancer and draw attention to efforts to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment efforts.  Afghanistan Peace Process Oversight Our mission in Afghanistan has stretched on for 18 years and is the longest military operation in United States history. The costs of this war are significant with over 2,200 American service members giving their lives and more than 20,000 service members being wounded.  Unfortunately, like other war powers discussions, Congress has taken a backseat in the debate over the future of our mission in Afghanistan while the conflict has descended towards a stalemate. I introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at changing that. As we pursue negotiations with the Taliban and work to end our involvement, Congress must be a part of the process to ensure that our mission is brought to a responsible end.

It was an honor to spend Thanksgiving with soldiers and their families at Fort Riley, including Commanding General Kolasheski and his wife Buffy, 1ABCT Colonel Krattiger, and CSM Gutierrez and his wife Yvonne. Also, thank you to all those who helped prepare the Thanksgiving meal at Fort Riley. On Thanksgiving, and on every day, we are thankful for the sacrifices and service of Americans in uniform. We are also thankful to the servicemen and women who aren&#8217;t able to be with their families as they protect us and preserve our nation.    Hosting VA Secretary Wilke in Kansas This week, I hosted Robert Wilkie, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, in Topeka and Kansas City to highlight the innovative work taking place at Kansas VA Medical Centers and speak directly with Kansas veterans, caregivers and advocates. Showing Secretary Wilkie around our state allowed him to learn about the unique challenges facing rural veterans. Throughout our visit, we discussed everything from the implementation of the VA MISSION Act to legislation I introduced to improve mental health care and increase suicide prevention programs within communities. Secretary Wilkie and I started our visit in Topeka at the Colmery-O&#8217;Neil VA Medical Center. Thank you to the Kansas VA leaders Dr. William Patterson, Director Rudy Klopfer, Director Rick Ament, Director David Isaacks, and Director Donna Meyer-Hickel for joining us from across the state, and for all the work you do on behalf of veterans. During our time at the facility, we had important conversations about how we can support our nation&#8217;s heroes by constantly improving the VA healthcare system. The Topeka VAMC&#8217;s satisfaction rates are among the highest in the country, and it was a pleasure to highlight the hardworking Kansans that make this possible for our nation&#8217;s heroes.    Next, we traveled to Kansas City and met with veterans and advocates. Secretary Wilkie and I answered questions about our work to improve the VA and provide veterans with the care and support they deserve. Together, we&#8217;re working hard to create a 21st century VA that is worthy of the service and sacrifice of our heroes. Watch my video&nbsp;here&nbsp;regarding the visit.&nbsp;    Newton City-County Airport Awarded FAA Grant Earlier this week, I to announced that Newton City-County Airport was the recipient of a $7 million Airport Improvement Program grant awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration. Local airports, like the Newton City-County Airport are vital to the region&#8217;s economy and this grant will allow for much-needed infrastructure improvements. According to the Kansas Department of Commerce, the airport generates $157 million in economic impact to the local economy, and this award will enable the airport to support the area&#8217;s aviation needs for years to come. Touring the National Weather Service FacilityOn Tuesday, I toured the National Weather Service (NWS) headquarters for the Central Region, located minutes away from the Kansas City International Airport. This facility handles 11 states, including Kansas, and portions of five other states. It serves as a multipurpose location, operating as a Training Center for NWS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and as one of two Aviation Weather Centers in the world. This center is designated by the International Civil Aviation Organization to provide 24-hour forecasts for aviation-related weather issues, like turbulence and icing, providing a vital safety service to people and airports around the world. Thank you to Ken Harding, Dr. Robert Maxson, and Jeff Zeltwanger for the tour and our conversation about the importance of innovation in this field.    Visiting the Heart of America Regional Computer Forensics Lab Following my visit to the NWS headquarters, I toured the Heart of America Regional Computer Forensics Lab in Kansas City. The laboratory provides forensic services and expertise to support Kansas law enforcement agencies in collecting and examining digital evidence for a wide range of investigations, including child pornography, terrorism, violent crime, and fraud. This facility is a great example of the partnerships between law enforcement agencies in Kansas and their ongoing efforts to enhance public safety in our state. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice, I will continue to support and provide critical resources for our law enforcement agencies in Kansas. I thank our men and women in law enforcement for all they do to keep us safe.  Attending the KC Chamber&#8217;s 132nd&nbsp;Annual Dinner This week, I attended the KC Chamber Annual Dinner at the KC Convention Center. This year the KC Chamber presented Al Brooks with the 2019 Kansas Citian of the Year Award. Al is one of the first African-Americans to serve on the KC police force, directed the Human Relations Department in KC after the 1968 riots and founded the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime. Al also has served as a city councilmember, the Mayor Pro Tem and as a member of the KC Police Board. Al has been a role model to not only Kansas Citians throughout the years, but to many across our country. Kansas City is extremely grateful for all he continues to give back to the city. Mayor Kay Barnes, last year&#8217;s recipient, presented this year&#8217;s award to Al. In addition, thank you to Black &amp; Veatch CEO, Steve Edwards, for the invitation.  Attending the Kansas Farm Bureau Townhall Meeting On Sunday afternoon, I joined the Kansas Farm Bureau&#8217;s (KFB) Townhall to kick off their 101st annual meeting to discuss issues facing Kansas agriculture. I enjoyed hearing from several producers across our state on the topic of trade and its importance to the products we grow. I spoke on the importance of USMCA to states like Kansas and how producers are facing tougher financial challenges that make working in agriculture more difficult. This can be addressed by promoting our commodities, strengthening existing trade deals and creating new trade relationships. Thank you to KFB President Rich Felts for hosting and providing a platform on which these topics can be discussed.    Visiting the Salina Emergency Aid &amp; Food Bank On Friday, I was in Salina to visit the Salina Emergency Aid Food Bank.&nbsp;Starting in 1971, the Salina Food Bank has served those in the region who are struggling with hunger and other daily needs. Thank you to Executive Director Michael Chambers who led the tour and showcased the outpouring support from the Salina community. In the Senate, I chair the Hunger Caucus where I am working to raise awareness about issues surrounding hunger and always appreciate witnessing the ways in which Kansans are constantly working to serve their neighbors.&nbsp;    Recognizing Small Business Saturday I shopped small on Small Business Saturday, stopping in two of my favorite spots in Topeka: Dean&#8217;s Books and Porubsky Grocery. I also thanked a number of small businesses in Hoyt and Mayetta during my Jackson County Listening Tour Stop. Small businesses play a critical role in our economy and local communities &#150; creating two out of every three new net jobs. Remember to #shopsmall and help support small businesses during the holiday season.&nbsp;    Hosting Kansas Listening Tour Stops Saline County On Friday, I was in Gypsum for a Saline County townhall meeting. We discussed important issues ranging from mental health, education, trade, the impeachment hearings, and the importance of being involved in your local community. Our discussion also focused on veterans and potential health consequences for those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thank you to folks from Saline County for sharing their thoughts and ideas with me and to State Representative Steven Johnson for attending.    Jackson County&nbsp;On Saturday, I visited Hoyt and Mayetta for another stop along my Kansas Listening Tour.

As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai&#8216;i if there is anything we can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.  &nbsp;  Brian Schatz United States Senator              Expanding Benefits For Veterans As a result of legislation authored by Senator Schatz, which was signed into law last year, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced its plans to expand access to military commissaries, exchanges, and recreation facilities to more veterans and caregivers. Thousands of veterans in Hawai&#8216;i may be eligible for these new benefits. Veterans and caregivers eligible to access commissaries and exchanges beginning on January 1, 2020 include:   Purple Heart recipients Former prisoners of war All veterans with service-connected disabilities Individuals approved and designated as the primary family caregivers of eligible veterans under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers    For more information on how eligible veterans and caregivers can access the new benefits, and on the DoD&#8217;s implementation of Senator Schatz&#8217;s law,&nbsp;click&nbsp;here.&nbsp;   Supporting Our Healthcare Needs The U.S. Department Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) announced that the West Hawai&#8216;i Community Health Center will receive a $1,060,398 grant to help low income families on Hawai&#8216;i Island access quality and comprehensive health care. &#8220;The West Hawai&#8216;i Community Health Center provides affordable and accessible health care services to thousands of people who might not otherwise receive care,&#8221; said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. &#8220;The new funding will give the Center the resources it needs to continue to serve Hawai&#8216;i Island families.&#8221;  The West Hawai&#8216;i Community Health Center (WHCHC) operates eight locations on Hawai&#8216;i Island and offers comprehensive, high-quality primary health services to medically underserved individuals and families regardless of their ability to pay. They provide medical, behavioral health, and dental services to people of all ages.&nbsp; In 2018, WHCHC served more than 16,000 patients. A significant number of those patients include veterans, migrant farm workers, patients experiencing homelessness, and patients living in poverty.   Securing Funds For Public Transportation The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announced that the State of Hawai&#8216;i will receive a $6.5 million grant to purchase new buses for Kauai and Hawai&#8216;i Island. &#8220;Investing in new buses for Hawai&#8216;i Island and Kauai means that the residents who depend on them to get to school or work every day will continue to have an affordable way to get around,&#8221; said Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The funding will be used to purchase ten 40-foot ADA accessible vehicles for the County of Hawai&#8216;i and three 30-foot buses and three under 30-foot buses for the County of Kauai.    According to the Hawai&#8216;i Department of Transportation, the ten new buses for the County of Hawai&#8216;i will be used on the Hilo-to-South Kohala Resort commuter routes, the newly created East Hawai&#8216;i-to-West Hawai&#8216;i commuter routes via Saddle Road, the Pahoa commuter route, and the Hilo intra-city routes. The FTA&#8217;s Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Program is to assist in the financing of buses and bus facilities capital projects, including replacing, rehabilitating, purchasing or leasing buses or related equipment, and rehabilitating, purchasing, constructing or leasing bus-related facilities.   Evaluating the Impacts of Climate Change Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) led a hearing of Senate Democrats&#8217; Special Committee on the Climate Crisis entitled, &#8220;Perspectives From The Front Lines: How Climate Change Uniquely Impacts Environmental Justice Communities.&#8221; At this hearing, the special committee - which is chaired by Senator Schatz - listened to leaders from low-income communities and communities of color that bear the brunt of our environmental burdens and discuss the unique climate change impacts they are facing as well as their vision for national climate change action.    To watch the hearing, click&nbsp;here.  Senator Schatz also recently introduced the Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 2019. The legislation will direct the Federal Reserve to conduct stress tests on large financial institutions to measure their resilience to climate-related financial risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &#8220;While our federal regulators are legally obligated to manage and reduce risks in the financial system, they have been ignoring the growing financial risks of climate change,&#8221; said Senator Schatz. &#8220;We should not be treating some risks different from others: risks are risks. This bill will push the Fed to do their job and start taking climate risk seriously.&#8221;  Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like floods and wildfires. It is also changing long-term climate patterns in ways that will lower labor productivity, devalue and destroy fixed assets, stress agricultural yields, and ultimately affect every sector of our economy. These impacts will pose risks for financial institutions and the global financial system.   Sharing Our Unique Stories   Earlier this month, Senator Schatz joined Never Whisper Justice Films for an interview to discuss his work to extend Pell Grant eligibility to prisoners.    Senator Schatz gave remarks at the dedication of the HECO/Navy joint solar project in West Loch on Oahu.

We need to push forward policies that make it easier for our rural citizens to have access to quality healthcare, and one of the keys to bridging the gap is in expanding rural broadband. Quality, affordable rural broadband means innovative healthcare options: video consultation, remote patient monitoring, and electronic health records.   As the only Missourian in the House Agriculture Committee, my amendment to the farm bill increased the baseline speed for&nbsp;broadband programs, ensuring we are investing federal dollars in technology for the future. Another amendment I passed includes loan guarantees to incentivize private investment into the development of rural broadband. Additionally, I helped pass funding for the USDA investments of more than $1 billion into programs supporting access to rural broadband through the ReConnect grant program and have been encouraging local entities to apply. &nbsp;&nbsp; These are real issues Americans face. We need to focus our energy on addressing them.  _____________  At a press conference put together by House leadership, Speaker Pelosi raised skepticism over passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in the remainder of the 2019 legislative year. It is unfortunate that Speaker Pelosi has led us to believe in the last weeks that the USMCA would be brought to the House for a vote, only now to dash hope of such an opportunity. The USMCA is a winning plan that deserves support. It will bring 176,000 new jobs to the U.S. and will spur over $60 billion in new economic activity. Additionally, it opens access to critical markets, such as the Canadian dairy market. The agreement is a great improvement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It increases the percentage of components in goods that have to be made in North America in order to take advantage of the free tariff advantage. The USMCA also has stronger labor provisions than NAFTA, protecting American workers from being undercut by cheap foreign labor. The agreement also addresses a range of issues rarely addressed in NAFTA, such as regulations on digital trade and a chapter dedicated to small businesses. I hope that Speaker Pelosi will allow Congress to vote on this deal. Politics shouldn&#8217;t stand in the way of progress. I look forward to working expeditiously to secure this new deal for Missouri and all Americans.  Legislative Update On Tuesday, I voted for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The bill passed the House, was cleared by the Senate, and was sent to President Trump for his signature.  The measure requires the federal government to impose sanctions against Chinese government officials accused of violating basic human rights of Hong Kong citizens. It also takes a step forward in re-assessing the relationship between the United States and Hong Kong, particularly in determining the official U.S. position on Hong Kong&#8217;s political status.  District Update I was pleased to conduct my Healthy Futures / Drug Free Missouri Assemblies on Friday. We started out in Bates County with an assembly at Rich Hill High School. It was then onto Barton County, where I spoke to students at Lamar High School. We ended the day at Osceola High School in St. Clair County.    The assemblies began with a Healthy Futures Quiz Competition featuring three teams, each made up of one teacher and one student. Then, with the help of Captain Kip Bartlett, Task Force Commander of the Mid-Missouri Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Task Force, and speakers Tom Johnson and Carole Mitchell, we were able to present students with many good reasons to steer clear of drugs.    Constituent Update Finally, there is some wonderful news for Columbia-area adults who left school without ever receiving a high school diploma. MERS Goodwill has opened the Excel Center adult school in the old Columbia Tribune building in downtown Columbia. This is designed to help students who left school for any number of reasons and who want to perhaps improve their positions at work or go to college.    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The old Columbia Tribune building now houses the Excel adult high school  Both daytime and evening classes are available. And, for adults with children, the school is providing free daycare in addition to the free tuition. The school, which opened last month, has about 150 students enrolled.

Though there is a great deal of noise filling the halls of the Capitol at present, I refuse to be distracted by partisan games. I remain focused on issues that matter most to my constituents, such as: helping our nation&#8217;s heroes, ensuring seniors have access to quality healthcare options, strengthening national security, facilitating financial prosperity and providing individual constituent service. Continue reading this brief update to learn more about my work on your behalf last week.  Advocating for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  The suicide crisis is a multi-faceted national crisis - not a Veteran-specific one - and it is going to take a government and society wide effort to solve it. Since only six of the 20 servicemembers and Veterans per day who are taking their lives are receiving healthcare services at VA, we must empower VA to work through community partners to reach those most in need.   The IMPROVE Act will prevent Veteran suicide by expanding the reach of VA&#8217;s suicide prevention programs and increasing coordination among community resources that serve a wide variety of Veteran needs. This approach has been helpful in reducing homelessness in the Veteran community, and I believe it will be successful in reducing these staggering suicide statistics.&nbsp; In last week&#8217;s VA Committee&#8217;s Legislative hearing we discussed the IMPROVE Act in greater detail. I&#8217;m a proud cosponsor of this legislation, which will leverage community organizations to help in this fight. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my exchange with Secretary Wilkie. &nbsp;  While we took an important step in advancing legislation to help ensure Veterans don't fall through the cracks last week, Veterans in need of immediate care do not need to wait for this bill to pass. If you or a Veteran you know needs assistance, please reach out. You are not alone. Help is available.   Additionally, this&nbsp;article explains that the VA is finally starting to take the matter of sick Veterans who have been exposed to burn pit toxins more seriously. However, much more can be done to help these Veterans in need. Learning from our mistakes in the past, we must get these heroes the care and benefits they deserve. I have filed bipartisan legislation that will do just that, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight.&nbsp; Helping Seniors  I was glad to review the&nbsp;results from the Pinellas Community Foundation and the Area Agency on Aging's study regarding the needs of seniors in our community. The survey&#8217;s findings are consistent with what I regularly hear from my constituents: access to affordable prescription drugs, dental and healthcare services remain a primary concern. I will continue to work on bipartisan solutions to these issues, and look forward to being a part of the working group of state and local stakeholders seeking to meet these needs.&nbsp; Also, open Enrollment for Medicare ends December 7th. Did you know that a record 24.4 million Americans &#150; 40% of the total Medicare population &#150; are expected to choose a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan during this open enrollment period? The percentage of local MA participants is even higher. I will continue to fight to ensure all seniors have access to healthcare choices, because 94% of MA participants report being satisfied with their current plan. If you or a loved one need help deciding which option is right for you, you may want to contact SHINE at 1-800-96-ELDER. SHINE is a non-profit organization funded by the FL Department of Elder Affairs which provides individual and group counseling about the healthcare options available to seniors.   Protecting National Security  Last week, I filed bipartisan legislation to prohibit future deployment of U.S. strategic assets in Turkey. Unfortunately, under the control of President Erdogan, Turkey has proven that it can no longer be trusted as a reliable ally of the United States. Deploying strategic assets to Turkey no longer makes sense. Click here to learn more.&nbsp; Facilitating Financial Success  Improved consumer confidence is an important indicator of economic strength.&nbsp; New&nbsp;reports show that the majority of Americans believe the economy is doing well and that we are on the right track. I want to make sure that we continue to implement pro-growth policies that benefit all Americans.&nbsp;  Another important component of our continued financial prosperity involves boosting tourism. Last week, my BRAND USA reauthorization bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Brand USA has a proven track record of increasing international tourism to the United States without using any tax dollars. Since tourism is such an important part of our state&#8217;s economy, I want to be sure that this successful program continues. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and help get the bill across the finish line.   Raising Awareness  November is Diabetes Awareness Month. According to the CDC, at least 30 million children and adults in the United States have diabetes.

He had called my office to seek assistance obtaining a visa.  &#8220;One is never sure on the outcome and the duration of these activities until you get the passport back; and we just received both passports back with a 5 year multiple entry visa. I truly wanted to thank Congressman Gus Bilirakis for his effort and support in this, I am sure the outcome would have been different without his strong push/recommendation.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team enjoyed the Grand Opening of Monticciolo Dentistry in Land O' Lakes last week. Welcome to Central Pasco!   My team was honored to participate in last week's Topping Out Ceremony at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH). During this ceremony, the last steel beam was placed on the bed tower project. This marks the culmination of my decade long battle to secure state-of-the-art, private rooms for Veterans in Pasco and Hillsborough county who receive their care at this hospital. In total, the 245,000 square feet of new construction and 5,000 square feet of renovated space will add 96 medical surgical single patient rooms and 40 intensive care unit beds. Given that JAHVH was first constructed in 1971, Veterans have often communicated their desire to receive treatment in a facility that was better equipped to manage the changes that have occurred in the delivery of medicine in the past 50 years, such as greater privacy. It has been a long and arduous process to get to this point, but I would not quit, and the results are going to be worth the effort. Our Veterans deserve the dignity that these private facilities will offer. I have always said that they should have access to the highest quality care in the very best facilities, and today we are one step closer to making that a reality.   My team was also able to participate in the Grand Opening of the Thermo Fisher Scientific Rapid DNA Center of Excellence at the FIU National Forensic Science Technology Center in Pinellas County. For crime labs, law enforcement, and first responders seeking technology, training, and expertise in advanced DNA analysis, the new Center of Excellence is a resource with state-of-the-art testing and training laboratories. It will develop validation guidelines, training modules, and support materials for stakeholders.     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update. I'd like to wish each of you and your families a very Happy Thanksgiving.&nbsp; I hope you are able to relax and enjoy quality time with your loved ones.&nbsp; Remember, you can always stay in touch with me via email, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Risch Has Quiet but Key Role on National Stage By Betsy Russell - October 6, 2019  In September, Idaho Press Tribune reporter Betsy Russell came to Washington, D.C. to shadow me for a week and examine my role as your senator and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&nbsp; Over the course of the week, she sat in on my meetings with constituents, attended committee hearings, and interviewed a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Below is an excerpt of her article about how I&#8217;m serving you in Washington:&nbsp;   Risch&#8217;s days in the Senate proceed at a lightning-quick pace. He sits for a briefing on Asia issues with his staff in his office before a big hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee, asks a few questions, makes some notes in a binder with a Sharpie. &#8220;Thanks &#151; good job,&#8221; he concludes. &#8220;This is good stuff.&#8221; Immediately after that briefing, a staffer informs him the president has tweeted about a new national security adviser appointee. &#8220;It was the worst-kept secret in D.C.,&#8221; Risch responds, adding, &#8220;Good pick. He&#8217;s got a solid reputation.&#8221; He then heads off to the hearing, and is accosted in the Capitol basement by a phalanx of national reporters with questions about the attack on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure. &#8220;I&#8217;ve reviewed all the intelligence on the matter,&#8221; Risch declares. &#8220;The president was on very firm ground.&#8221; Asked by reporters what more he needs to hear to conclude that Iran was responsible for the attack, Risch says brusquely, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need to hear anything more. It speaks for itself.&#8221;  The reporters move on, and Risch steps onto the Capitol&#8217;s internal subway to travel to the hearing. Asked how frequently he gets questions about his conversations with the president, Risch says, &#8220;Oh, 10 times a day. Frequently.&#8221; He shares little from those conversations, beyond general positions with which he&#8217;s stating agreement. While presiding over the Asia hearing, he has to leave periodically to cast votes on the Senate floor, as do other members of the panel; Risch hands the gavel off to another member when he steps out. Risch&#8217;s schedule before and after the hearing is peppered with various meetings with constituent groups, each of them cued up in a different conference room surrounding his Senate office. He meets with health care advocates from Idaho. He steps behind closed doors to chat with Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. He meets with representatives of Melaleuca and Scentsy pushing a direct-selling bill. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to have any trouble with me on this,&#8221; he tells them. &#8220;I know what a contract employee is.&#8221; Risch says he once held 26 constituent meetings in a single day. Now that he&#8217;s the Foreign Relations chairman, his schedule also includes visits with international delegations and high-ranking foreign officials.  &nbsp;...

He answered the call to duty, fought against the communist Chinese forces, and when his tour was done, he returned home to civilian life, like so many of his generation. Over the years, the service medals he earned were lost, so he came to my Coeur d&#8217;Alene Office, seeking help in getting them replaced. My casework staff was successful in navigating that process, and on October 3rd, I was grateful to be able to visit Charles and present him with the medals he earned so many years ago.    &nbsp;    Fighting for Veterans Health Care Early in September, Senator Crapo and I joined Senators Wyden and Merkley of Oregon in pressing TriWest Healthcare Alliance on the way it has implemented its new urgent care benefit under the VA MISSION Act. We did so because of disturbing reports that veterans in Idaho and Oregon haven&#8217;t been able to access their urgent care benefits. We will continue our efforts to hold TriWest accountable until our veterans are able to receive the care and benefits they have rightfully earned.&nbsp;    &nbsp;    An Update from Senator Risch on the Columbia River Treaty  &nbsp;Since the 1960s, the United States and Canada have had an important relationship managing energy production and flood control governed through the Columbia River Treaty.   This Treaty has been largely beneficial to both our nations, but we have now reached a time where the Treaty must be modernized. As both an Idahoan and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee through which all international treaties must be processed, securing central provisions of the Treaty and strengthening our strategic relationship are of great importance to me.  I recently sat down to be briefed by the State Department&#8217;s negotiating team where I learned that negotiations are progressing and I am confident that they are working to protect Idahoans interests. I will continue to closely monitor the treaty negotiations and I will not move forward on any treaty that does not achieve our goals or meet our needs.     &nbsp;        Women Entrepreneurs in Rural Idaho Face Unique Challenges. We Are Working to Change That. By Senator Jim Risch - October 16, 2019  It seems like nearly every day there&#8217;s a news story or statistic proclaiming Idaho as one of the best places to live, raise a family, and grow a business. Idaho is all those things and more, and people across the country are taking notice. Just this past August, Idaho received an &#8216;A&#8217; rating in small business friendliness from Thumbtack, and in a new study from American Express, Idaho earned a spot in the Top Five for &#8220;economic clout&#8221; of women-run businesses, defined as an increase in the number of women-owned firms and their growth in employment and revenue. Women small business owners in the Gem State are driving much of the innovation and economic growth we have experienced over the past decade. But apart from the thriving business communities in Idaho&#8217;s urban hubs, we have countless women entrepreneurs in the rural reaches of our state who are outperforming expectations. They are the ones making Idaho the success story that it is. Last week, I had the opportunity to partner with the National Women&#8217;s Business Council and meet some of these women from the Idaho business community for a Rural Women&#8217;s Business roundtable. The roundtable, which was hosted at the new Nampa Women&#8217;s Business Center, drew women entrepreneurs from across the state, with participants traveling from as far as Moscow and Filer. Their challenges with starting and growing a small business often paralleled one another&#8217;s. Being in Idaho, they told me, they have to work harder to access capital to grow their businesses, sometimes traveling to neighboring states to secure startup funding. Patchy internet access also poses a challenge, with many rural parts of the state lacking an adequate broadband connection to conduct ecommerce. On top of this, the difficulty of finding and hiring qualified workers &#150; something all small businesses struggle with &#150; is particularly acute for women running businesses in rural parts of the state. We should all be committed to helping these small business owners and entrepreneurs address these issues. We are actively working to encourage eligible members of Idaho&#8217;s business community to host a Small Business Investment Company (a program that helps fill funding gaps for small businesses), and I recently introduced legislation to streamline and better manage the SBIC application to potentially increase funding streams for emerging businesses. To address the challenges of effective rural broadband, I&#8217;m advocating for grants that will offset the high cost of deploying broadband to underserved communities. And while hiring continues to pose a challenge to Idaho businesses, I will work with my colleagues in the state to ensure Idaho attracts and maintains a broad and qualified workforce. Idaho&#8217;s success is no coincidence. We understand the importance of keeping the government out of the way so that businesses, families and workers can thrive. Last week&#8217;s conversation underscored the tenacity and spirit of Idaho&#8217;s business community, and it gave me great hope for the future of Idaho. I applaud the women business owners I had the privilege of meeting, and look forward to watching their continued progress and success.  ...

Additionally, I have introduced bipartisan legislation to confront ongoing instability in the Middle East that will safeguard our national security interests.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Follow Me on Social Media Are you on Facebook or Twitter?

I also voted out of committee this week a bill that requires audits of large-scale federal properties leased to private parties, such as the president&#8217;s hotel in Washington, D.C. I issued a joint statement with my colleagues on the Trump Administration&#8217;s announcement it would no longer consider Israeli settlements built in disputed territory to be against international law.

On the floor, I voted to pass  to extend government funding through December 20th, which will keep the government open and ensure funding for critical budget priorities. This CR provides a 3.1 percent pay raise for our armed forces and ensures an accurate and thorough Census in 2020. I also voted to pass , the Workplace Violence Prevention for Healthcare and Social Service Workers Act. This bill requires employers within the health care and social services industries to develop and implement a workplace violence prevention plan. I am an original cosponsored of , the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act. I was proud to vote to pass H.R.737, which would prohibit the possession, sale, or purchase of any shark fin or product containing shark fin.  In order to keep federal funding flowing to wetlands conservation programs across the nation, I voted to pass . This bill reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and extends funding for these critical conservation programs through 2024. Finally, just a reminder that you can track every vote I take, in almost real time, on my website&#8217;s Voting Record page by . Protecting Our Local Environment  This week, I also voted to pass two bills&#151;one on the floor and one out of committee&#151;that will expand and strengthen the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (Santa Monica NRA) and large portions of the Southern California coastline.  One bill, , is sponsored by Congressman Ted Lieu and directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of portions of the Los Angeles coastal area from Will Rogers State Beach to Torrance Beach (including portions of San Pedro coastline) to evaluate alternatives for protecting the resources of these areas.  The Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica National Recreation Area  The second bill, which I voted out of committee this week, is , the Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act. Sponsored by Congressman Adam Schiff, this bill will adjust the boundary of the Santa Monica NRA to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor, adding just over 170,00 acres to the Santa Monica NRA and connecting it to Angeles National Forest. Ensuring Taxpayers Receive Fair Compensation From Federal Leaseholders  President Trump&#8217;s Washington, D.C. hotel is actually a government-owned building&#151;a former post office that is on the National Register of Historic Places. One of the president&#8217;s companies leases the property from the government and pays $250,000 a month in rent. It is one of only a handful of federal properties leased to a private party. Some of these leases, including the Trump hotel, were written without provisions mandating government audits, despite the profit-sharing nature of the leases.   The Old Post Office building before conversion to a hotel  This week, I voted out of committee a bill, , to correct this error and require audits of large-scale federal properties leased to private parties. The American people own these buildings and they have a right to know if the leaseholders, including the president, is making proper payments to the federal government. Trump Administration Changes Long-Held U.S. Position On Israeli Settlements  This week I joined with my House colleagues Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Gerry Connolly (VA-11), Lloyd Doggett (TX-35), Barbara Lee (CA-13), David Price (NC-04), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Peter Welch (VT-At Large), and John Yarmuth (KY-03) in issuing a joint statement on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&#8217;s announcement that the Trump Administration would no longer consider Israeli settlements built in disputed territory to be against international law. This is a radical step that overturns U.S. foreign policy on the issue that has been in place since the 1970s. The statement reads:  &#8220;Secretary Pompeo&#8217;s statement today singlehandedly undermines decades of U.S. policy by declaring that Israeli settlements in occupied territories do not violate international law in the eyes of the U.S. government.&nbsp; This announcement, when coupled with recent decisions to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem apart from any resolution of outstanding issues, to close the Palestinian office in Washington, D.C., to shut down the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and to cut assistance to the West Bank and Gaza, illustrates that the Trump administration is dead set on destroying any sliver of hope remaining for peace and security in the Middle East. It&#8217;s clear the Administration has no plan to bring Israelis and Palestinians together in good faith.  &#8220;Most importantly, this decision jeopardizes the safety of both Israelis and Palestinians and undercuts any prospect for a two-state solution. This flagrant disregard for international law and the U.S. role as an honest broker in this conflict further undercuts both U.S. leadership and credibility, and it must be reversed.&#8221; Working To Make All Transportation Modes Safer  Earlier this year, the 75-meter dive boat MV Conception caught fire of the coast of the Channel Islands, burned, and sank. Thirty-four passengers, asleep below deck when the fire started, all died.  found that for decades the U.S. Coast Guard has not implemented many civilian maritime vessel safety measures recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) following their investigations into accidents such as the Conception fire. One of the primary responsibilities of the NTSB is to recommend safety regulations based on the findings of their investigations. Over more than five decades, their work has made road, water, and air transportation decidedly safer. But too often, their recommendations have not been adopted by the relevant agency. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I have repeatedly pushed for adoption of long ignored NTSB recommendations that would clearly make transportation safer. Just in April, I  to implement an NTSB recommendation that truck drivers and railroad operators should be screened for sleep apnea. I will continue to push for adoption of NTSB recommendations and track the agency response to these recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I firmly believe that every safety recommendation the NTSB makes should be seriously considered for adoption by the relevant agency, such as the FAA, the FMCSA, or the Coast Guard, with the primary and foremost consideration being whether the recommendations make transportation safer. Other considerations should remain secondary.&nbsp;       Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents on the topic of protecting our nation&#8217;s public lands. Below is my response to those messages: &#8220;As you know, now more than ever, many of our nation&#8217;s public lands are under threat from mining, drilling, fracking, and reckless development. Like you, I am concerned about these threats and will continue working to protect lands across the country.  In October 2019, I was proud to vote for the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act, the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act, and the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy (CORE) Act.&nbsp; These three bills would protect Arizona&#8217;s Grand Canyon from uranium mining, reduce fracking and drilling around New Mexico&#8217;s Chaco Canyon, and establish new protected lands in Colorado.  As chair of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, it was my privilege to hold hearings on proposals to protect the Grand Canyon from uranium mining, as well as a field hearing on the Chaco Culture Heritage Protection Act in Santa Fe, New Mexico. While in Northern New Mexico, I had the opportunity to meet with local tribal officials, see the increased impacts in the area from expanded oil and gas drilling, as well as to tour Chaco Canyon itself. During my time in Congress, I have championed legislation to protect public lands across the country. In the 115th Congress, I was the lead sponsor of the Red Rock Wilderness Act, which would designate as Wilderness a portion of Utah&#8217;s spectacular Redrock country&#151;an unparalleled landscape of deep red canyons, windswept mesas and fantastical sandstone formations.&nbsp; I am also a cosponsor of the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act, which would utilize federal energy development revenue to provide funding to address the nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog for the National Park Service and other related agencies. As a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I am committed to protecting these lands for years to come.&nbsp; &#8221;  If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.  You can find out how to contact me on my website by        The Congressional Progressive Caucus  The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is a House of Representatives caucus that works to advance progressive and liberal issues and positions and represents the progressive portion of the Democratic Party.

Mike Gallagher and colleagues introduced the House companion to Senator Rick Scott&#8217;s bipartisan&nbsp;American Security Drone Act of 2019&nbsp;in the House of Representatives. The American Security Drone Act prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We have to get serious about the national security threat we face from Communist China, who is STEALING our technology and intellectual property. Yet, the U.S. Government continues to buy critical technology, like drones, from Chinese companies backed by their Communist government. We cannot allow this, and Congress should immediately pass the American Security Drone Act.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from&nbsp;Representative Gallagher&#8217;s office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s Support of President Xi Puts Profits Over Human Rights&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after Michael Bloomberg ignored Senator Scott&#8217;s request to change the location of the New Economy Forum, which was&nbsp;set to take place in Communist China this week.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;President Xi continues to violate human rights and go back on every commitment he has made to the United States. How can someone who is running for President think it is acceptable to host a large scale event in Communist China? As Michael Bloomberg makes his case to the American people, he will have to answer for his support of a Communist government and his decision to put profits over human rights.&#8221; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Chris Van Hollen Urge NASEM to Study Role of NIH in Drug Development and Patient Access  Senators Rick Scott and Chris Van Hollen wrote a letter to the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) asking them to&nbsp;issue a report on its recent workshop examining&nbsp;the role of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the development of new drug treatments and&nbsp;its&nbsp;impact on patients.

Rick Scott Statement on U.S. Senate Confirmation of Robert Luck  Senator Rick Scott released the statement below following the U.S. Senate&#8217;s confirmation of Robert J. Luck, of Florida, to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud the Senate voted to confirm Justice Robert Luck to serve on the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Luck is a native Floridian who has dedicated himself to a career in public service. As Governor, I had the distinct pleasure to appoint Justice Luck to the bench twice &#150; first to the Miami-Dade circuit court in 2013, and later to Florida&#8217;s Third District Court of Appeal in 2017. I&#8217;m confident Justice Luck will continue to serve our state and nation well, and I am honored to support his confirmation to the federal bench.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Passage of Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act  Senator Rick Scott spoke on the floor in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which will give the United States more authority to re-evaluate Beijing&#8217;s influence on Hong Kong. Senator Scott is a proud co-sponsor of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and won&#8217;t stop fighting until America&#8217;s economic and political future &#151; and the freedom of nations across the globe &#151; is secure from the threat of Chinese influence.

Rick Scott Statement on U.S. Senate Confirmation of Barbara Lagoa  Senator Rick Scott released the statement below following the U.S. Senate&#8217;s confirmation of Barbara Lagoa, of Florida, to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad the Senate voted today to confirm Justice Barbara Lagoa to serve on the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Lagoa has a long history of honorably serving our state. She was appointed to Florida&#8217;s Third District Court of Appeal in 2006, and to the Florida Supreme Court last year, as the first Cuban American woman to serve on that court. I look forward to Justice Lagoa&#8217;s continued service to the people of Florida and am confident she will honorably and faithfully serve the Eleventh Circuit for many years to come.&#8221;  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Tom Cotton and Colleagues Request Suspension of Licenses Allowing U.S. Exports to Huawei  Senators Rick Scott, Tom Cotton and colleagues sent a letter to the President expressing deep concern that the U.S. Department of Commerce has begun issuing export licenses to U.S. firms looking to resume business with Huawei Technologies, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China. In the letter, the Senators requested that the President take immediate action to suspend these approvals to protect national security.&nbsp; Read more, including the full letter, from Senator Tom Cotton&#8217;s office HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott&#8217;s Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act Introduced in the House  This week, Congressman Dave Joyce introduced the companion bill to Senator Rick Scott&#8217;s Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act in the House of Representatives. The&nbsp;Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act&nbsp;will create&nbsp;a consumer-friendly database of prescription drug prices, which will empower American families to make informed healthcare choices.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason patients shouldn&#8217;t know exactly what their prescription drugs cost before they get to the pharmacy. The&nbsp;Prescription Drug Price Reporting Act&nbsp;gives patients the information they need to make informed decisions for themselves and their families. Even in the hyper-partisan, dysfunctional world of Washington, D.C., creating more transparency in the healthcare system is something we must get done now to help families across our nation.&#8221;&nbsp;  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to President Trump: Protect American Taxpayers&#8217; Retirement Funds from Communist China  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio sent a letter to President Trump asking him to replace members of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) after their reckless decision to shift billions of dollars from the Thrift Savings Plan retirement fund to an index fund that includes Chinese companies. Senators Scott and Rubio introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, which would prevent the FRTIB from steering federal retirement savings to Communist China.

A bipartisan bill I authored to help protect Veterans passed out of the House, my bill to boost tourism passed out of Subcommittee and I introduced another bipartisan measure to improve healthcare outcomes for all Americans. Continue reading for more information about my continued work on your behalf.  Fighting for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  Last week, the House passed my Student Veteran Empowerment Act as part of a larger Veterans' package. My bill ensures Veterans utilizing the GI Bill are protected from unexpected school closures. Specifically, GI Bill entitlement benefits are fully restored to a Veteran if a school closes mid-semester without the ability to transfer credits to another institution. Additionally, it put safeguards in place and establishes oversight measures to help prevent school closures from occurring. This bill is about doing the right thing for our nation&#8217;s heroes. They sacrifice a great deal in order to earn the GI Bill, and I want to ensure that those benefits aren&#8217;t squandered by those seeking to exploit students for financial gain. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in expediting passage of this commonsense legislation. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my remarks on the House Floor about this important bill.  Reducing the number of homeless Veterans in America has been a priority of mine since joining Congress. Last week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a 2% decrease in the number of homeless Veterans throughout the nation between 2018-2019, which reflects an approximate 50% reduction since 2009. Locally, the agency reports that Pasco County saw a 57% reduction between 2018-2019, and Hillsborough County saw a 12.9% reduction during this same period. We are making progress, however, even one homeless Veteran is one too many. I will keep working to eradicate homelessness from within the Veteran community. &nbsp; During last week's VA Committee hearing we discussed the spread of false information on social media specifically targeting the Veteran community. We want to work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that those who prey upon our heroes are stopped and held accountable for their deceitful actions.&nbsp; You can watch my exchange with panelists by clicking&nbsp;here. Additionally, I had the chance to meet with VA Committee Ranking Member Phil Roe and VA Undersecretary of Benefits, Dr. Paul Lawrence. We received an update on implementation of the Forever GI Bill and new Information Technology systems. It is important that we provide oversight to ensure the VA is taking action on these important new requirements of law which are designed to help Veterans.   Promoting Tourism  Last week, while I was reading the paper and enjoying my morning coffee, I was delighted to find an ad urging Congressional leadership to reauthorize Brand USA, the nation&#8217;s first public-private partnership to promote the United States as a premier travel destination. As co-Chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, I am proud to co-lead the bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3851, which reauthorizes this important program. The program is particularly beneficial to the Sunshine State. Tourism is the backbone of Florida&#8217;s economy, generating over 1.4 million jobs and bringing nearly 130 million visitors to our state every year. Brand USA has helped create these jobs, reduced the national debt by $231 million dollars, and costs absolutely nothing to tax payers. It is important that Congress reauthorizes Brand USA, and I will continue to work hard to ensure the passage of this legislation.   Also, the Florida Congressional Delegation met last week to discuss ways that we can work together to boost tourism throughout our great state. I&#8217;m thankful for Visit Florida and others who testified on the importance of bringing visitors from around the globe to our great state.  Additionally, the Tampa International Airport was&nbsp;named the best mid-sized airport in America last week. As someone who travels in and out of the airport most weeks, I know how much TPA deserves this special recognition. Joe Lopano and his team work hard to maintain a customer-centered experience, ensuring continued accessibility while allowing for the expansion necessary to boost tourism and enhance options for travelers. &nbsp; Improving Healthcare  Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, to bolster diagnostic research in medicine and improve patient outcomes. Our bill makes critical investments to advance research and progress in diagnostic quality, safety, and value in health care. In the United States, diagnostic errors result in between 40,000 and 80,000 preventable deaths and cost the health care system more than $100 billion each year. Millions of Americans are negatively impacted by a diagnostic error each year. Patients experience a broad range of complications resulting from these errors. While some patients may only encounter a minor inconvenience, many others experience worsening health conditions and even death. According to a 2015 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime. Our bipartisan legislation seeks to tackle this important issue through targeted research that will yield standards in improving the quality, safety and overall value of diagnostics. It is an important step in improving the quality of healthcare available to Americans.   Creating healthy families starts with ensuring the health and well-being of expectant mothers. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 700 women die each year in the U.S. as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications and this is significantly higher than many other developed countries. The Health Subcommittee began investigating this growing problem several years ago, and last year, the President signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law. This important law improved data collection and reporting regarding maternal mortality. It also developed systems at the local, state, and national levels to better understand the burden of maternal complications.  We built off that essential work by passing two bipartisan bills in last week&#8217;s Health Subcommittee mark-up hearing. The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act, authorizes grants to identify, develop, and disseminate maternal health quality best practices, supports training for health professionals, and authorizes grants for operating innovative evidence-based programs that deliver integrated services to pregnant and postpartum women. The Helping MOMS Act enhances coverage for pregnant and postpartum women in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs by giving states the option of covering pregnant and postpartum women for a year instead of 60 days, which is the current timeframe. These bipartisan bills demonstrate our commitment to continue addressing maternal mortality and improving the health outcomes in expectant or new mothers across the country.   Protecting Human Rights  So a short Greek and tall Turk meet at the U.S. Capitol...That might be the opening of a cross-cultural joke, but the actions of Turkey's President Erdogan are NO joke. Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter shared with me the unprecedented harassment he has suffered at the hands of Erdogan's bullying simply for pointing out human rights violations perpetrated by the Turkish regime. Like Kanter, I called for President Trump to cancel last week's meeting with the Turkish leader. A NATO ally that continues to militarily occupy an EU nation, harasses and jails journalists, denies religious freedom to the Holy See of over 300 million Orthodox Christians, violates the Exclusive Economic Zone of a sovereign nation, provocatively infringes on the air space of another, and systematically tries to annihilate the Kurds, does not deserve the ear of the leader of the free world. Though feet apart in height, Enes Kanter and I see eye to eye. I will ensure his voice is not silenced as he speaks truth to power. #shortgreek #EnesKanter  Meeting with Constituents  I appreciated the opportunity to meet with members of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, including Commissioner Jack Mariano and School Board Member Cynthia Armstrong, during their visit to D.C. last week. I enjoyed talking with them about the issues impacting local businesses and their legislative priorities.  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received an email from an elderly constituent in Dade City who was frustrated that his trash hadn&#8217;t been picked up in weeks. While this certainly isn&#8217;t a federal issue, my team tries to help whenever possible. My staff contacted the appropriate local officials, and within two hours, the constituent&#8217;s trash had been removed and his account credited for a month worth of service. He called my office very grateful for such prompt assistance.  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. While we can&#8217;t promise a positive outcome on every case, we do constantly look for ways to help constituents with the problems they are facing. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  It was a great morning for my team to visit the Friday morning market in Dunedin, located in John R. Lawrence Pioneer Park at the intersection of Douglas and Main Streets. I was pleased to find out the market supports locally-based food vendors and small businesses.   My team had the pleasure of participating in the grand opening of the Bayonet Point Wound Care Center. I am confident many patients will get great care at this new facility. Welcome to the neighborhood!   My team enjoyed participating in the North Tampa Bay Chamber's ribbon cutting for Parks Ford. It is great to see Central Pasco County continuing to grow.   My team had the pleasure of facilitating a meeting between Hillsborough and Pinellas county sheriff offices last week. The discussion centered around the possible expansion of a program to bring more mental healthcare professionals to the Pinellas County Jail. It&#8217;s my commitment to help curb recidivism in correctional facilities through a combination of increased access to mental health and the utilization of innovative approaches to help offenders become productive citizens.   My team was honored to help celebrate the 100th birthday of one of my constituents, Cosimo A. DePietto. Captain DePietto served in World War II. Thank you for your service and a very Happy Birthday, sir!   Additionally, at last week&#8217;s Council of Organizations meeting in Dunedin, my team was glad to hear an update from Sheriff Bob Gualtieri on the work he and his team are doing to keep our community safe. We really are fortunate to have so many outstanding first responders who protect and serve the citizens of Tampa Bay each and every day.     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update.

This week's episode covers the&nbsp;rising costs of healthcare &#150; which became more expensive thanks to Obamacare. Premiums are up. Copays are up. Deductibles are WAY up. Now, the Socialist Democrats are proposing Medicare-for-All, which would ruin the Medicare system and throw 150 MILLION people off the private insurance they like. The solution to the crisis of healthcare costs is not more government participation, it&#8217;s less. That&#8217;s why Senator Scott is working on common sense solutions to provide quality healthcare at a price American families can afford.&nbsp;See more in the video below or HERE.    Senator Rick Scott also cosponsored the&nbsp;SFC Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019&nbsp;to make sure our men and women in uniform are taken care of every step of the way. See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.              Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Committee Passage of Legislation to Protect Florida&#8217;s Environment  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation advanced two of Senator Rick Scott and Marco Rubio&#8217;s bills to protect Florida&#8217;s environment. The Committee voted to pass the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act to expand research and understanding of blue-green algae and red tide, and the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act of 2019&nbsp;to reauthorize and modernize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 to help restore and protect our nation&#8217;s coral reef ecosystems.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;People from across the world come to Florida because of the state&#8217;s natural beauty. During my eight years as Governor, Florida&#8217;s annual investments to preserve the environment increased by $1 billion. I&#8217;m proud to join Senator Rubio and my colleagues on the Committee to pass the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act and the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act to build on our efforts to protect and preserve Florida&#8217;s environment for generations to come.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Statement Ahead of President Erdogan&#8217;s Visit to White House  In advance of Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s visit to the White House, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;President Trump should implement aggressive sanctions against Turkey for purchasing the S-400 missile system from Russia.&nbsp;Existing law under CAATSA requires the President to enforce sanctions, and today I&#8217;m urging the President to do this immediately unless Erdogan changes course. If he doesn&#8217;t, Congress should consider immediate action.&nbsp;We should also re-evaluate Turkey&#8217;s membership in NATO, a treaty organization created to act as a bulwark against Russian aggression. If Turkey continues to cozy up to Moscow, there is no reason they should enjoy the protections of the NATO alliance. I introduced a resolution in July that lays out these goals. I urge my colleagues to join me and present a united front.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Decision to Invest Retirement Savings in Communist China Threatens National Security  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) decided to shift billions of dollars from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement fund to an index fund that includes Chinese companies. Senator Scott is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan, bicameral Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, which would prevent the FRTIB from steering federal retirement savings to Communist China. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in the FRTIB for ignoring requests from Congress to reverse this decision. Choosing to invest in Communist China threatens our national security and jeopardizes the retirement savings of hardworking Americans. There is no reason U.S. taxpayer dollars should be used to prop up companies under the control of Communist China, which continues to steal our technology, abuse human rights and build up its military to compete with us. I will continue to work to pass the Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, to protect the American people and prevent the FRTIB from supporting Communist China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.

I&nbsp; had the great honor of presenting a late veteran's family with a Purple Heart for his sacrifice to our country. Our brave and dedicated service members and their families make significant sacrifices to protect our freedoms, and I am forever grateful to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Participating in Impeachment Questioning     As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I participated in the impeachment hearings that took place this week. On Wednesday, I questioned Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. On Friday, I questioned Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are clear, confirmed by our witness, Ambassador Yovanovitch: defensive lethal aid was provided to Ukraine not by the Obama Administration, but by the Trump Administration.&nbsp;Obama&#8217;s own State Dept. was so concerned about conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden&#8217;s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping the Ambassador for her confirmation. Yet our Democratic colleagues and Adam Schiff cry foul when we dare ask that same question.&nbsp;I was very disappointed that Chairman Adam Schiff continued limiting questions from Republican Members of the Intelligence Committee, and I will continue to speak out to ensure full transparency for the American people.  Watch my full questioning from day one here, and day two here. Writing an Op-Ed on Serving North Country Veterans  In case you missed it, this week I wrote an op-ed to the Sun on ensuring North Country seniors have access to quality and affordable care. Here is an excerpt below: Veterans Day is a time to recognize and thank those who dedicate their lives to serving our great nation and protecting our unique freedoms. The North Country is home to more veterans than any other district in New York state; one of my main priorities in Congress is to work tirelessly to improve their lives and ensure they receive the best possible care, benefits, and recognition for their service. Fort Drum, home of the 10th Mountain Division, is an important part of our district as it remains critical to preserving a strong national security and contributes to the economic well-being of the community. I have been a proud and outspoken advocate for all of our veterans. It is essential that veterans have access to affordable, quality healthcare and benefits. So far this Congress, I had the opportunity to work to advance several important bills that honor and protect veterans. I helped lead the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, which restored benefits to veterans who served in the territorial seas of Vietnam and were exposed to Agent Orange, and was signed into law in June of this year. Read the full Op-Ed here.&nbsp;  Appearing on Fox News with Martha MacCallum    I was glad to appear on Fox News with Martha MacCallum to discuss this week's impeachment hearings and Adam Schiff's broken, partisan impeachment process. I will continue to be a leading voice by asking relevant questions and demanding transparency throughout the process. You can watch my full interview here and above.&nbsp;  Announcing USDA Rural Community Facilities Funding for Clayton  This week, I announced a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan totaling $2,734,000 to be awarded to Cerow Arena, an existing community center in the town of Clayton. The funding will be used to fund a 12,500 square foot addition and improve building accessibility, office space, and provide upgrades for the facility to maintain its Red Cross Shelter Certification. I am excited that the town of Clayton will be receiving this critical funding to revitalize their important community center. This loan will allow the center to remain an important part of the Clayton community for many years to come. I am a strong advocate for the rural development of our North Country communities through projects like these, and look forward to continuing my work to ensure our region has access to resources to further enhance our communities. Read more about the funding here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!     Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read: Watertown Daily Times:  Editorial &#151; Down to earth bills: Lawmakers draft measures to help farmers and their workers  Bills recently proposed in Albany and on Capitol Hill would benefit farmers as well as the people who work on them.  A proposed piece of federal legislation would assist undocumented immigrants in obtaining H-2A work visas and green cards. This would ensure more parity for dairy farmers as this program is usually reserved for seasonal employees. Dairy farmers, of course, need workers year-round. &#8220;The Farm Workforce Modernization Act, co-sponsored by 44 representatives including Rep. Elise Stefanik, D-Schuylerville, would provide undocumented farmworkers a pathway to permanent legal status, or green cards, and farmworkers in the year-round dairy industry access to the H-2A work visa program, which is typically reserved for seasonal and temporary agriculture industry. Proponents of the bill have said it&#8217;s a critical move to support the agriculture industry in its time of crisis due to a struggling economy, attacks on seasonal worker visa programs and an increasing number of employee audits by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials,&#8221; according to a story published Nov. 1 by the Watertown Daily Times. &#8220;The legislation stipulates that immigrant farmworkers who have worked in agriculture for at least two years prior to the introduction of the bill would be eligible for &#8216;certified agriculture worker status.&#8217; The status can be adjusted to lawful permanent residency &#151; or a green card &#151; if the immigrant has worked a specified number of years before and after the bill enacted.  &#8220;The bill would also streamline the application process for seasonal worker visas, raise wages and allow agriculture workers access to more green cards,&#8221; the story reported. &#8220;The access to the H-2A work visa would be groundbreaking for the large dairy industry in upstate New York, which was comprised of nearly 4,300 farms in 2017, according to the state Department of Agriculture. With low-skill work visas currently reserved for temporary, seasonal industry, the dairy farm industry tends to have largely undocumented workers.&#8221; Ms. Stefanik&#8217;s support of this bill reflects her understanding of the obstacles that dairy farmers in Northern New York confront. It should have enough backers to make it through the U.S. House of Representatives.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

One day is not enough to honor the time our servicemembers have spent away from their families, defending the freedoms we get to enjoy. Thank you to all who have served and to their families, and thank you to Mayor Linda Gorton and Councilmember Susan Lamb for hosting a beautiful ceremony to honor our veterans.&nbsp;You can find my full statement on Veterans Day, including some legislative achievements we have made for our veterans here.    &nbsp;  Dear Friend,  &nbsp;  This week represents a time of gratitude to our nation's veterans for their service in defense of the freedoms we hold so dear. Although we will never be able to repay the tremendous debt we owe to our veterans, I encourage all of us to use this time to give thanks. I also want to use this newsletter to discuss the legislative progress we have made in the Commonwealth against the opioid epidemic and provide perspective on the impeachment narrative at a time when Democrats want to jump to conclusions.&nbsp; &nbsp; HEALING COMMUNITIES STUDY LAUNCH &nbsp;        On October 7, I had the chance to join various national leaders to celebrate the launch of the UK HEALing Communities study on opioid deaths (photo by Mark Cornelison).    &nbsp;  My office is happy to have played a role in the University of Kentucky receiving $87 million in grant funding as part of the HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-term) Communities Study. The funding was announced in April, but officially launched this month. I had the honor of speaking&nbsp;alongside my colleagues&nbsp;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to commemorate the launch of the program. Our Commonwealth is among the states hit the hardest by this epidemic, making this event all the more important. The goal of the HEALing initiative is to reduce opioid deaths by 40 percent throughout Central Kentucky. You can read more about the study and event here.  &nbsp;  PROVIDING HEALTHCARE FOR THOSE IN NEED &nbsp;        Last month, I joined state officials in Mt. Sterling to announce a $500,000 grant for the&nbsp;Post Clinic.&nbsp;    My office was pleased to support a $500,000 grant that was awarded to the Post Clinic in Mt. Sterling last month. This grant will help ensure vital healthcare services continue to be provided for those in need. The Post Clinic provides free, essential services to those in Montgomery and surrounding counties who are without insurance, underinsured, or on Medicare or Medicaid, ranging from primary care to dental care. You can read more about the Post Clinic, its services and eligibility requirements here.  COMMUNITIES WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGHT OPIOIDS &nbsp;        Last month, I had the pleasure of meeting with Wolfe Countians Against Drugs to learn more about their mission to create drug-free communities.    &nbsp;  One of the greatest assets we have during this epidemic is our own community coming together to help those affected. I had the chance to get a firsthand look at this when I met with Wolfe Countians Against Drugs to discuss legislative progress made on the opioid crisis. I am proud to see our local communities coming together to support those in need; this sense of caring for our neighbors is what makes our District and our Commonwealth so unique. We have made tremendous progress on the legislative front and I will continue to fight in Washington to ensure this progress is not lost. You can read more about Wolfe Countians Against Drugs here.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;AMERICANS DESERVE TRANSPARENCY ON IMPEACHMENT   Last month, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats voted on the House floor to deprive any resemblance of due process when it comes to impeachment. This resolution advanced the secretive, hyper-partisan effort from Democrats to impeach the President on yet another baseless theory. I voted against this resolution that attempts to undo the vote of the American people in the 2016 election. You can read my full statement on the resolution here. I also discussed the impeachment inquiry with Leland Conway on WLAP radio in Lexington.&nbsp;You can listen to the entire interview&nbsp;here. &nbsp;  &nbsp; MOBILE OFFICE HOURS To better serve the people of central and eastern Kentucky, my staff conducts regular traveling office hours in every county of the Sixth Congressional District.

Honoring Our Nation&#8217;s Veterans Recognizing Veterans Day As we come together as a nation to recognize Veterans Day, we honor the incredible sacrifices men and women in uniform have made on behalf of our nation and for our freedom. America has been made exceptional by the enduring courage and bravery of our troops who have waged war against our adversaries so that our country and world could remain more peaceful. We also are called today to rededicate ourselves to make certain that veterans are treated with the care and respect they deserve following their service to our nation, and I hope we all take time to reflect on the profound impact of our servicemembers, past and present. To all those who have served our country: thank you, we respect you and we love you. To watch a video message to our nation&#8217;s veterans, click&nbsp;here.   Discussing our Work to Support Veterans at the Washington Post I joined my colleague, Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.), this week for a Washington Post Live event, Veterans in America. During the event, Sen. Tester and I discussed issues facing our nation&#8217;s veterans as we recognize their service this Veterans Day. We primarily discussed mental health, suicide prevention and the importance of providing access to timely and quality healthcare to our heroes who deserve the best our nation has to offer.&nbsp;As Members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. Tester and I introduced the&nbsp;Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act&nbsp;to address the increasing demand for access to mental healthcare and various resources that can saves lives. Sen. Tester and I also discussed the merits of this legislation on the live panel, which is named after a decorated Navy SEAL who lost his battle to PTSD in 2018. Our legislation would expand access to care for rural veterans using telemedicine, invest in non-VA organizations and healthcare programs, offer non-traditional mental health treatments like agritherapy, make investments in gender-specific services, and ease the transition of servicemembers into civilian life.&nbsp;We also discussed the&nbsp;VA MISSION Act&nbsp;and how implementation that follows the intent of Congress will help veterans across the country access care through the VA and in the community. This landmark legislation improves access to community care for veterans and streamlines the cumbersome requirements that previously limited community care and the ability of veterans to receive quality healthcare close to home. Allowing Kansan veterans, especially rural veterans across the country, to seek care in the comfort of their community will improve the physical and mental well-being of those who selflessly served our country.    Chairing a Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee Hearing On Wednesday, I chaired a Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee hearing that considered two nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans&#8217; Claims. This Court was established in 1988 to review decisions made by the Board of Veterans&#8217; Appeals to make certain veterans receive the care and benefits they rightfully deserve. Just last year, the Court received 6,802 cases and decided 4,842 appeals. This caseload highlights the importance of the Court and the impact its decisions have on veterans across the country. The two nominees, Scott Laurer and Grant Jaquith, have accomplished legal and military careers and will serve veterans to the best of their ability once confirmed.    Recognizing Veterans Day at the Manhattan American Legion On Monday, I joined members of the Pearce-Keller Post No. 17 of the American Legion and the Luckey Assembly Knights of Columbus in Manhattan to recognize Veterans Day. During the breakfast, it was an honor to speak to so many veterans from the across Manhattan whose dedicated service to our nation lives on through their service to the American Legion and a number of community organizations. Thank you to all those who organized the breakfast and for their continued work to honor and support our nation&#8217;s heroes.   &nbsp;Announcing BUILD Grants for Infrastructure Improvements in Olathe and Ellis County Earlier this week, I was pleased to announce that a total of $16.5 million in BUILD grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation were awarded to entities in Kansas. This funding will go toward two vitally important infrastructure projects in Ellis County and Olathe, Kansas.&nbsp;Ellis County Through the BUILD Grant program, $6.5 million was provided to Ellis County for new resources to improve the Northwest Business Corridor. The resources provided in this grant will allow for increased economic development in the region and help existing businesses expand through improved infrastructure. The current roadway that is the Northwest Business Corridor was not designed for the volume or type of traffic driven by recent private-sector investment, and improvements along the corridor will help promote economic activity now and long into the future. Additionally, it will improve safety for travelers who take the corridor and increase access to businesses along the route. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read more on this award.&nbsp;Olathe The $10 million in funding was provided to the City of Olathe for the expansion and improvement of the I-35 and 119th Street interchange, otherwise known as the Interstate 35 and 119th Street Interchange Reconfiguration Project. One of the highest traffic volume intersections in the state, this area serves as the spine for KC&#8217;s Gateway District and the completion of these improvements will allow residents and travelers to safely and more effectively access jobs, businesses and amenities in the area. Click here&nbsp;to read more on this award. Speaking with Incoming Wichita State President Dr. Jay Golden On Monday, Dr. Jay Golden was named the next President of Wichita State University by the Kansas Board of Regents. Dr. Golden&#8217;s background in developing partnerships between higher education and the private sector, as well as his experience growing universities, will serve Wichita State, Wichita State students and the entire region well. I look forward to work in partnership with Dr. Golden and to continue making progress on important issues facing the community.    Speaking at the KU Cancer Center&#8217;s 2019 Research Symposium This week, I joined researchers from the University of Kansas Cancer Center for the Center&#8217;s 2019 Research Symposium, and had the opportunity to offer remarks in support of their work which carries significant life-saving potential. In my remarks I underscored the importance of the research conducted at the KU Cancer Center, and how their work fits into, and furthers, a larger collaborative effort to defeat cancer. My efforts to increase resources available for the National Institutes of Health through the Senate Appropriations Committee is driven in large part by the progress being made at the KU Cancer Center and similar academic research institutions across the country. In addition, Dr. Jensen presented me with the 2019 KU Cancer Center Director's Legislator of the Year award. Thanks, Dr. Jensen, for this special recognition and for our close partnership in our work to advance medical research in the region. Robba and I are grateful for your continued friendship.&nbsp;I appreciate Dr. Roy Jensen, Director of the KU Cancer Center for inviting me to speak at the Symposium, and Dr. Christopher Austin, Director of NIH&#8217;s National Cancer Center for Advancing Translational Sciences for addressing the symposium. I will continue to be a strong advocate for NIH to ensure that it, and its partners like the KU Cancer Center, receive the resources necessary to continue to make strides in cancer research in a timely manner.    Meeting with the Kansas Air National Guard On Wednesday, I met with Airmen from the 190th Air Refueling Wing, a Kansas Air National Guard unit based out of Topeka, Kansas. These &#8220;Outstanding Airmen&#8221; were chosen by their chain of command to travel to our nation&#8217;s capital to attend leadership development training and meet with national security and defense policy leaders.&nbsp;These Kansas Airmen shared their work promoting mental health and suicide prevention within their units. We discussed the importance of providing a support system for our friends and colleagues who might be dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression. Suicide, especially by veterans and servicemembers, has become a national crisis so I was pleased to hear that the 190th AWR used a drill weekend to bring its Airmen together and attend the leadership development training in D.C.    Spending Time with Kansas City Area Aviation Leaders FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center On Friday, I spent time at the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center in Olathe. During the tour, I heard about the operations of the facility and the work that the controllers do to get over 6,000 flights safely across our region every day. During our meeting, we discussed the detrimental impacts of a government shutdown on both the center&#8217;s operations, and on their work to train air traffic controllers. I was pleased to hear their support for my legislation, the&nbsp;Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2019, which would prevent future shutdowns from damaging this vital industry. Thanks to National Air Traffic Controllers Association local leaders Todd Mariani, Nathan Burch and Jami Davis for their informative tour, and to FAA Air Traffic Manager Christina Calvert for her leadership of the facility.    Collins Aerospace Following my time at the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center, I was in Lenexa to tour Collins Aerospace. Collins is engaged in designing, manufacturing and servicing a multitude of systems and components for commercial, business and military aircraft. The men and women of their Lenexa facility produce aircraft oxygen systems and in-air beverage products, serving as a critical link in the aviation supply chain. Thanks to the many employees for taking time out of their day for the tour and for their productive conversation. Thank you also to Collins Aerospace General Manager JP Foulon and General Manager of Beverage Products Sabastian Ramus for their tour.    Meeting with Members of the Lenexa Chamber of Commerce  On Thursday evening, following my return to Kansas from Washington, D.C., I was in Lenexa to attend the Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s &#8216;After Hours&#8217; event that brings members together on a regular basis. During the event, I was pleased to visit with folks and discuss our work in the Senate, as well as recent developments happening in Lenexa and across Johnson County.    Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.&nbsp;  Please let me know how I can be of assistance.

Out of the ashes of this day rose what was originally called Armistice Day but since 1954 has been recognized and set aside as Veterans Day. On this Veterans Day, we recognize the roughly 20 million veterans who have served this country in both war and peace, and as a Nation, we extend a hand of gratitude to all our veterans who put their lives on the line daily to protect freedom on our soil and around the globe.  As a Member of Congress, advocating for our veterans and their families is a top priority. My district offices in Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Roanoke, and Staunton help veterans with their claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and in Washington, I am always looking for new ways to do more to support those who have supported us. Over the past year, my colleagues and I have strived to honor veterans by advocating for and passing legislation, some of which the president has signed into law, concerning burn pits, suicide prevention, veteran healthcare options, Blue Water Navy, the widow&#8217;s tax, Reserve and National Guard bankruptcy, and opening up membership into the American Legion for previously disqualified veterans.  Couple that with some good employment and economic news: The 2018 veteran unemployment rate of 3.5 percent was the lowest since 2000, meaning that the unemployment compensation payments to veterans fell to $178 million in 2018 from a high of almost $1 billion in 2011.  &nbsp; Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act:&nbsp;Passing the House in March, H.R. 1381, the Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act, would strengthen and expand the VA&#8217;s registry of service members who were exposed to toxic chemicals and fumes from burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. This measure currently awaits further action in the U.S. Senate.  &nbsp;         &nbsp;  Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act:  In June, the president signed H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. For decades, tens of thousands of veterans suffering from diseases caused by Agent Orange in the Vietnam War and their families have been denied their earned benefits under the Agent Orange Act of 1991. While it was long past due, the House voted unanimously to correct the injustice done to Blue Water Navy veterans. Under the bill&#8217;s provisions, veterans who served in specified offshore areas near Vietnam from January 9, 1962, through May 7, 1975 will be given the presumption of Agent Orange exposure, thus allowing them to receive medical care and disability compensation.  &nbsp;          VA MISSION Act:  Also in June, a new VA program went into effect. Titled the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthen Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act, this legislation overhauled VA care programs by allowing veterans to seek medical treatment outside of the VA system. While the VA offers overwhelming support to our nation&#8217;s veterans, those who wish to seek health services outside the system should have the right to do so. This bill does not force any veteran out of the VA system, but simply ensures that our service members have access to the quality and timely care they have earned. As the VA continues to implement the changes laid out in the&nbsp;MISSION Act, you may rest assured that my colleagues and I in Congress will continue to hold the agency accountable to protect against any veteran falling victim to a broken system.  &nbsp;        Copyright, The Roanoke Times, republished by permission.     LEGION Act: On July 30, I joined the President in the Oval Office as he signed H.R. 1641, the&nbsp;Let Everyone Get Involved in Opportunities for National Service&nbsp;(LEGION)&nbsp;Act.&nbsp;This legislation expands American Legion membership criteria to include all honorably discharged veterans who served their country. The passage of this legislation means that our heroes who have served in times of unrecognized conflicts will finally be eligible to join the American Legion. Passing this bipartisan bill was the right thing to show our gratitude for those military members who honorably served and for those who paid the ultimate sacrifice during unrecognized periods of conflict.  &nbsp;          National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act: In August, the President signed another one of my bills, H.R. 3304, the&nbsp;National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act into law. Under the new law, certain members of the National Guard and Reserves who fall on hard economic times after returning from active duty deployment will continue to obtain relief without having to fill out the substantial paperwork required by the so-called &#8220;means test&#8221; under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.&nbsp;This bipartisan legislation allowed us to extend the commonsense measure of relieving our veterans of burdensome paperwork for four years.           Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act:  Additionally, I was pleased to also support legislation aimed at ending the &#8220;widow&#8217;s tax&#8221; and to expand the burn pit registry program. Impacting an estimated 67,000 military survivors, I was proud to cosponsor H.R. 553, the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act. If passed, this legislation would allow the survivors of deceased servicemen and women to keep their Military Survivor Benefit Plan payments when they are awarded the VA&#8217;s Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. Dubbed the &#8220;widow&#8217;s tax,&#8221; current law calls for an offsetting of these two payments, in some cases wiping out most or all the Benefit Plan payments.  &nbsp;         &nbsp;  Improve Act:  It is a national shame that 20 veterans a day die by suicide, and 14 out of these 20 veterans are not under the care of the VA and are outside the system. After 15 years and billions of dollars spent on VA mental health programs, the statistic has remained virtually unchanged.&nbsp; To address this ongoing problem, I cosponsored H.R. 3495, the Improve Well-Being for Veterans Act, which if passed, would create a grant program that would allow the VA to tap into the nationwide network of organizations, including state and local organizations, already providing lifesaving services to local veterans, especially those the VA has not been able to reach before. It is my hope that this much needed legislation reaches the House floor soon and that its intended purpose saves the lives of our service men and women who suffer from the unseen costs of war.  &nbsp;  If you or someone you know is struggling, please call the Veterans Crisis Line below for help:         More Work To Be Done:&nbsp;  While Congress has done much since January, there must be continued focus on the veteran suicide rate, as well as improvement on the quality and timeliness of healthcare treatment, female veterans, veteran homelessness, and military spouse hiring. Females are the fastest-growing segment of the veteran population. They are also most at risk for becoming homeless. The VA must continue to improve on their healthcare delivery for female veterans. There must be uniform and consistent care in the VA system that meets the unique needs of all female veterans at every hospital within the VA system. After a decade of reduction in veteran homelessness, the number of veterans on the street has ticked up slightly, with housing prices in cities like New York and Los Angeles being the leading cause. Although we spend billions on helping the homeless, we must ensure that there are jobs that can provide the means to support them and their families. We must not rest until every veteran who wants to work has a job, and every veteran who is homeless is housed.  For over 250 years, our nation has produced individuals who came before us in the fights for freedom and democracy. Our republic has been blessed that there are those for whom service above self is more than a saying but a way of life.  On Veterans Day we honor your courage and sacrifice, and we salute you and your family for service to our nation.  &nbsp;         &nbsp;  Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman.

The Washington D.C. &#8220;swamp&#8221; would be a much better place if my colleagues had a chance to take in the flatlands of the South Plains, surrounded by our values of family, faith, and hard work. As we head into the final weeks of 2019, it is my hope that House Democrats will stop staging political theater and instead focus on actually solving the problems everyday Americans face.  Taxpayer Friendly Environmental Stewardship On November 4th, three years after the Obama administration unilaterally forced our country into the feckless and economically crippling Paris Climate Agreement, I introduced H. Res. 676, legislation that encourages the U.S. to formally withdraw from this Obama-era agreement. While this feel good, political window-dressing would have no meaningful impact on international air quality, it would levy a huge tax on America&#8217;s middle and working class and increase the price they pay at the pump and to heat their homes. At a time when American innovation is leading the way in environmental stewardship and reducing carbon emissions worldwide, I&#8217;m proud to stand with President Trump, West Texas energy producers, and taxpayers. Click here to read my full statement and the text of the resolution.  Real Healthcare Solutions for Real Healthcare Problems Listening to the people of the 19th district share their thoughts on the issues most important them is one of the most fulfilling aspects of my duties as your representative. This week, I visited doctors at Covenant Health Radiology Diagnostics to examine how government can play a constructive role in improving our healthcare system. With the expertise and care these physicians provide, Lubbock continues to be a medical hub for the entire West Texas region!  I also had the pleasure of meeting the wonderful residents and staff at the SilverSpring nursing facility in Abilene this week. After singing hymns, we discussed the importance of long-term care centers and lowering drug prices for our seniors. As a member of the House Ways and Means committee, I will continue fighting to ensure my constituents and all Americans receive the highest quality care.     Hate and Fear, Not Truth and Justice House Democrats continue to play political games with impeachment; games where there are no rules and everyone loses. Bypassing our democratic system, their endless attempts to destroy our duly elected President are conducted not in the name of truth and justice, but out of hatred for President Trump&#8217;s America First policies and fear that they won&#8217;t be able to defeat him at the ballot box. By holding closed-door, secret meetings, the Democratic leadership has caved to the demands of their far-left, socialist members that want to rid Washington of the President and reverse the economic prosperity and conservative values he has advanced and fought for.

The Border Crisis Next Door This week, we lost nine of our fellow American citizens at the hands of Mexican drug cartel violence. Six of these lives lost were those of children, and I can think of nothing more evil or depraved than killing innocent children. &#8234;This despicable attack highlights the need to secure our border and bring these narco-terrorists to justice. My thoughts and prayers are with their loved ones as I implore my colleagues to work with me toward legislation that secures the border and keeps our nation&#8217;s families and borders safe. USMCA Tracker It has been well over 300 days since President Trump signed the United States Mexico Canada Agreement that will usher in 176,000 new jobs and add over $70 billion to our economy. While our farmers and ranchers bear the brunt of China&#8217;s unjustified retaliatory tariffs throughout the current trade negotiations, Speaker Pelosi is holding USMCA hostage. The time to call USMCA up for a vote is now.    Shining a Light for Our Heroes This week, the City of Lubbock issued a proclamation to keep the porch light on throughout Veterans Day to remember and honor those currently serving and our Veterans who have served in peace time or war. I join the City of Lubbock in encouraging all citizens to shine a light at their home from Sunday, Nov.10th, at sunset through sunrise, Tuesday, Nov.12th. May we forever show our gratitude to the one percent of Americans who gave up their today so that we can have our tomorrow. Click here to read the proclamation from the City of Lubbock.

It&#8217;s always wonderful to spend time in Scott County, and I&#8217;m looking forward to our conversation on how we can continue working together to solve the issues you and your families face every day. We&#8217;ll be getting started at 10 AM on Saturday, November 23rd, and doors will open at 9:30 AM. Hope to see you there! In the district:  Election Day: Thanks to everyone who got out and voted for the important issues and elections on the ballot Tuesday in #MN02!   Providing farmers flexibility: Farmers know best what they need to run successful businesses - I spoke to folks at Brownfield News about my work on the Responsible and Efficient Agriculture Destination Act. Proud to be moving this essential bill forward on behalf of Minnesota farmers so that livestock and perishable goods can get to their final destination on time! You can listen to my interview here.&nbsp;   Working with local leaders: It&#8217;s always a great day when I get to meet with Governor Tim Walz! Thanks for sitting down to talk about how we can work together to lower the cost of healthcare, support Minnesota farmers, ensure high quality education for every student, and drive economic growth across the state.    District wide book tour: Did you know the Library of Congress has surplus books that Members of Congress can donate to local libraries and schools?

This week I was happy to visit Minnesota Corn President Les Anderson&#8217;s farm in Welch. Thanks for letting me ride along, Les - and especially thanks for letting me drive!     Addressing farmer mental health: The unique mental health challenges farmers face must be addressed - now. I've helped introduce a bipartisan bill to train USDA officials so they can address farmer mental health, increase awareness of resources, and reduce the stigma of mental health challenges in our agriculture communities. I talked to the folks at Northfield News about how I&#8217;m working to move this bill forward - read more here.

Its a disconcerting statistic that has left many Americans longing for an overhaul of the tax system: In fact, 68% of Americans said making sure the countrys top earners pay their fair tax share was extremely important, according to a recent Hart Research Associates poll. Now, two Democratic lawmakers are posing a solution to narrow this widening wealth gap. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Don Beyer will unveil major new tax legislation called a Millionaires Surtax on Thursday. The bill would add an additional 10% tax on top of existing tax rates for families whose incomes exceed $2 million per year for married couples filing jointly, and $1 million for single filers. The Tax Policy Center estimates the legislation, if enacted, would raise $635 billion over a decade. The Republican tax cuts, as we feared, led to enormous benefits for the wealthy and budget-busting deficits. Our legislation would address both of these shortcomings in a way which helps working people, Rep. Beyer said in a statement to TIME. It also specifically prevents tax avoidance, which has been an enormous problem in enforcing our tax code. Since the surtax would apply equally to all forms of wealth earned from investmentsversus just incomeloopholes would be nearly impossible. Additionally, because the surtax is an add-on to the current tax-code structure, it would be fairly simple to implement, the lawmakers argue. The proposal is not far off from the ones proposed by progressive 2020 candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, calls for a 2% annual tax on households with net worths between $50 million and $1 billion, and a 3% annual tax on families whose net worths exceed $1 billion. Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, would add a 1% tax for married couples who exceed $32 million in net worth, 2% for families whose net worths are $50 to $250 million. His proposal taps out at an 8% additional tax on families with over $10 billion in assets. Theres a lot of folks who are putting out there really major tax reforms, Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, tells TIME. Lets put it this way, members of Congress havent yet. The public is way ahead of members of Congress on these things. I view the surtax as a more moderate, practical first step for a member of Congress to put their name on. Clemente calls the Van Hollen-Beyer proposal a very elegant way to raise a substantial amount of money to invest in policy areas like healthcare, education and housing solutions, and protect existing services like Medicaid and Social Security  which is at risk of exhaustion. Current projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees predicts benefits are expected to be payable in full until 2037, at which point the reserve might be depleted. The Millionaires Surtax is about making the American Dream more real for all families  and it has widespread support from people across the country, argues Van Hollen. Support in the Senate, which is currently GOP-controlled, may be a little harder to come by, however.

Veterans Day On Monday, we come together to honor our nation&#8217;s 19 million veterans. I am so proud to represent over 24,000 of them. Our veterans answered the call from all walks of life and all corners of this globe, to serve and protect our great nation. Veterans Day and everyday we honor and appreciate them and all they gave to ensure the well-being and security of our country.    Not only do veterans deserve our respect and recognition, they also deserve to know that their nation is there for them, just like they were there for their nation. As Congress continues to work towards a budget, we must ensure that we provide the necessary funding for VA programs and departments as well as other organizations that care for and employ our veterans. Last year alone, nearly 9.17 million veterans and their families enrolled in the VA health care system. Since 2010, more than 765,000 veterans and their family members have been permanently housed, rapidly rehoused, or prevented from falling into homelessness by VA and HUD&#8217;s homelessness programs. And today, nearly 1.5 million veterans live in households that receive&nbsp;food assistance&nbsp;benefits.    To that end, my colleagues in Congress and I remain committed to strengthening quality healthcare for veterans, providing the education assistance we have promised, and ensuring veterans have access to quality housing, food, child care, and small business loans. We will fight to protect the programs veterans rely on, like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food assistance. And we will fight to end the invisible consequences of war that so many veterans face by providing more resources for mental health initiatives and suicide prevention outreach. Just as our veterans vowed to leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we vow to leave no veteran behind when they return home.  As a member of Congress, I will always stand up for our current and former armed service members and their families. I will continue to fight alongside you to make sure that our veterans are treated with dignity and respect, are properly cared for upon returning home, and can easily access the services and supports that they have earned. Throughout the year, I hope that you will take time to talk with and thank our veterans and military women and men. If you are a veteran yourself or if you know a veteran who may need assistance, I hope that you will reach out to me. My office and I are eager to do whatever we can to help you.    &nbsp;   Impeachment Update This week, my colleagues on the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees continued their work on the impeachment inquiry. The committees made transcripts publicly available from several of the witnesses they have heard from thus far. The full transcripts are available for everyone to read HERE. These transcripts confirm that President Trump removed a respected diplomat, Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch, in advance of a months-long pressure campaign to interfere in the 2020 election for his own political gain based on a smear campaign orchestrated by the President&#8217;s allies. This smear campaign against Yovanovitch was based on public falsehoods. The President&#8217;s allies sought to tarnish her reputation, character and her work to clear the deck to advance Trump&#8217;s scheme. Yovanovitch said she felt threatened by Trump&#8217;s words and attempts to remove her &#150; and expressed concern for her safety and career.&nbsp;  Ambassador Michael McKinley, a former Senior Advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testified he &#8220;had never seen&#8221; efforts to use the State Department to dig up dirt on a political opponent. &#8220;&#133;in 37 years in the Foreign Service and different parts of the globe and working on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in Washington, I had never seen that.&#8221; McKinley testified that, after reading the whistleblower complaint and related news, &#8220;it became evident to me that Masha [Yovanovitch] had been caught up in something that had nothing to do with the way that she performed her duties in Kyiv.&#8221;  Additional testimony of Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland show&nbsp;the progression of efforts by the President and his agent, Rudy Giuliani, to use the State Department to press Ukraine to announce bogus investigations that would benefit President Trump politically. President Trump directed the Ambassadors to work with Giuliani on Ukraine policy, and over the course of the summer, an effort was made to extract&nbsp;a public statement&nbsp;from the&nbsp;new&nbsp;Ukrainian president that the Ukrainian government was investigating&nbsp;a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 U.S. elections. Volker testified that Giuliani&#8217;s efforts to advance Trump&#8217;s scheme ran counter to U.S. foreign policy interests and was &#8220;extremely unfortunate for our policy with Ukraine.&#8221; They described an &#8220;unusual&#8221; hold was placed on the on taxpayer-funded military assistance to Ukraine. Volker testified that &#8220;it came from OMB,&#8221; the federal agency once run by Trump&#8217;s current Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified that, after a May 23, 2019 Oval Office meeting with President Trump, Secretary Perry, Sondland, and Volker &#8220;assert[ed] that, going forward, they would be the drivers of the relationship with Ukraine.&#8221; He added that the direction of U.S. policy towards Ukraine had shifted into &#8220;unusual channels&#8221; and that it was &#8220;somewhat unusual&#8221; to have the Secretary of Energy and the Ambassador to the EU engaged deeply in the policy of a country that is not an EU member state. Kent had &#8220;growing concerns that individuals were pushing communications with Ukrainians that had not been discussed and endorsed in the formal policy process.&#8221; Kent wrote a memorandum outlining &#8220;his concerns that there was an effort to initiate politically motivated prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both in Ukraine and the U.S.&#8221; These are just some of the highlights of the released transcripts. The Committees have announced that the first public hearings will begin next Wednesday, with public testimony from Kent as well as Ambassador Bill Taylor. I look forward to bringing you further updates next week.    Sincerely,   Unsubscribe                WASHINGTON, DC2367 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202)225-2111 CHICAGO5533 N.

Thank you for all you do to make our country&#8217;s freedoms and opportunities possible. We must honor the immeasurable debt we owe to past and present military members for their dedicated service by ensuring there are tools and support available to navigate civilian life. &nbsp;  Earlier this year I announced my VA Readiness Initiative, a comprehensive package of legislative items to ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is always ready to deliver excellent care to veterans. This initiative includes measures to expand access to services, encourage innovation for veteran healthcare solutions, increase accountability at the VA, and empower transitioning service members as they pursue civilian careers.  Happy Veterans Day weekend, may God continue to bless you and the United States of America.  Fighting for Colorado Military Funding For the second time in two months, partisan politics has prevented the U.S. Senate from moving forward on vital funding for the U.S. military. The Centennial State&#8217;s six military bases and critical military commands such as the newly formed U.S. Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base rely on this funding, and face an uncertain future because of Washington gridlock. Altogether, the Senate defense appropriations bill contains roughly $344 million to support military priorities important to Colorado.  Read my latest op-ed in the Colorado Springs Gazette, calling on all of my Senate colleagues to come to the table and provide the vital military resources that impact our national security and the lives of Colorado military families. Colorado&#8217;s service members exemplify the best of our nation, and they deserve better from Washington.  Akron Med Evac Tour &amp; Roundtable   &nbsp;  The staff at Med Evac in Akron work around the clock to help Coloradans in need and save lives during emergencies. Thank you to the pilots, medics, and everyone involved for a great tour and discussion about the services they provide to Colorado residents and how I can support their efforts at the federal level. Thatcher and Caitlyn were really impressed! New U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett  &nbsp; It was an honor to attend the swearing-in ceremony for the 25th Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, Barbara Barrett, in Colorado Springs. We were lucky to be joined by members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed group of African-American World War II military pilots. I&#8217;m grateful for their remarkable service to our nation.  Secretary Barrett&#8217;s new position is incredibly important to Colorado&#8217;s military installations and the future of U.S. Space Command in Colorado. With her strong background in aviation and government service, I have great confidence in her ability to serve as the new head of the U.S. Air Force and I wish her and her family well. Encouraging Investments in Every Corner of Colorado  Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) and I introduced bipartisan legislation to reform the approval process for charitable investments, so organizations can more easily invest in community improvement and job creation. Private charities are more than willing to invest in and grow the economy, but are too often deterred by government bureaucracy. The Philanthropic Facilitation Act (PFA) benefits rural economies in particular by cutting red tape and removing barriers between philanthropists and small businesses, ultimately leading to more job creation. This legislation is a common-sense solution that gets government out of the way and encourages more investments across Colorado where it is needed most. Fighting the Rise of Meth in Colorado  Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner&#8217;s remarks.  &nbsp; I successfully included a bipartisan amendment to increase funding for an anti-meth program in the domestic spending appropriations package passed by the Senate. In between 2011 and 2018, Colorado has experienced a nearly 40 percent increase in admissions for meth addiction. We have to provide new tools and resources to deal with the dangers caused by methamphetamines in our communities. My amendment increases funding for the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program to help state law enforcement agencies fight the rise of meth. Pushing for Full LWCF Funding Senator Michael Bennet and I introduced a bipartisan amendment to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the crown jewel of conservation programs for Colorado. This conservation program comes at no cost to the taxpayer, but has only been funded to its maximum authorization level twice in its history. We were successful in permanently reauthorizing the LWCF earlier this year, and the next step is to make funding automatic. Colorado&#8217;s beautiful public lands rely on this critical conservation program, and it&#8217;s time for Congress to fully and permanently fund it.&nbsp; The Ski Area Fee Retention Act Moves Forward  Click here or the picture above to view Senator Gardner&#8217;s remarks.  &nbsp; My bipartisan Ski Area Fee Retention Act gained traction with a recent hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I was fortunate to introduce Brendan McGuire, Vice President of Public Affiars at Vail Resorts Management Company, as he testified that this bill would give ski areas in Colorado an important tool to invest in development projects. The Ski Area Fee Retention Act would help local ski areas keep more of the fees they produce, which will lead to increased local investments and improvements. I&#8217;ll continue working to see this important legislation for Colorado ski areas signed into law. Colorado Priorities Pass the Senate I&#8217;m proud to have secured funding for a number of Colorado priorities in the domestic spending package passed by the U.S. Senate. This appropriations bill is important for rural Colorado, with full funding of the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program and an increase of funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) that will help ensure our beautiful public lands are preserved for future generations to enjoy. Click here to learn more about the Colorado priorities funded in the appropriations package, including a sizable increase for scientific research and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.  Maintaining a Critical Relationship with South Korea   &nbsp;  I was honored to be the first Member of Congress to meet with Lee Soo-hyuck, in his new capacity as the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States. The United States-Republic of Korea alliance is critical to U.S. economic and national security interests, and it is a lynchpin of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Our countries have worked together to promote international peace, security, economic prosperity, human rights, and the rule of law. The friendship between our two countries remains ironclad, and we will work together to make it even stronger. Tracking Chinese Intimidation of American Businesses Recently we&#8217;ve seen American companies censor themselves to avoid Chinese retaliation, which sends a chilling ripple effect across our country and further empowers the Chinese Communist Party. The first step to solving any problem is knowing its full extent, which is why Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and I introduced bipartisan legislation to create a U.S. government taskforce to monitor instances of China intimidating U.S. companies that exercise free speech.  TAIPEI Act Passes Senate Unanimously The U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, which Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) and I authored. This bipartisan legislation is intended to strengthen Taiwan&#8217;s standing around the world and comes in response to increased Chinese pressure and bullying tactics intended to restrict Taiwan&#8217;s international space and global diplomatic recognition. The United States should use every tool to support Taiwan&#8217;s standing on the international stage, and I applaud the Senate for sending a strong message to nations that there will be consequences for supporting Chinese actions that undermine Taiwan.

Click here! &nbsp; &nbsp;                                            Dear Cormack,&nbsp;Following a busy week meeting with folks across eastern Connecticut, here to provide you with some updates on my work as we head into Veterans Day Weekend:&nbsp;   An Important Update for our Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans  As&nbsp;we head in to this&nbsp;Veterans&nbsp;Day weekend, I&#8217;m looking forward to honoring all of our veterans at events across eastern Connecticut. Eastern Connecticut is home to so many of our nation&#8217;s veterans and active-duty service members, and it&#8217;s an honor to represent them in Congress. Today, ahead of Veterans Day, I announced the creation of a new resource page on my website to provide Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans and their families with important information on how to apply for new resources being made available to Blue Water vets through the VA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new resources are being made available following Congress&#8217;s passage and the signing-into-law of the&nbsp;Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act&nbsp;(H.R. 299), a bill that I&#8217;ve fought for years to get across the finish line. The new law will take effect on January 1, and my resource page will help provide veterans and their families with more information on the bill, and on how to file or re-file a claim with the VA so that they can receive the benefits they deserve.&nbsp; The debt we owe to&nbsp;our Blue Water Navy veterans&nbsp;for their service, and for the subsequent obstruction to their care, can never be repaid. However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act will soon be the law of the land, and it will help ensure that we do right by them moving forward.&nbsp;I encourage all Blue Water veterans, their families, and anyone else interested in taking advantage of these powerful new benefits to visit the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act resource page on my website, and to contact a Veterans Caseworker in my office so that we can make sure folks have the information they need to get the care they deserve.&nbsp;        Click here to visit my Blue Water Resource Page     Last Green Valley 25th&nbsp;Birthday&nbsp; &nbsp;Last week, it as great to join friends, community members, local leaders, and the staff of Last Green Valley (LGV) at Allen Hill Farm in Brooklyn to celebrate 25 outstanding years of the LGV. There was no better way to celebrate LGV&#8217;s big milestone than with a walking tour of the beautiful valley we&#8217;ve all worked so hard to protect, and I&#8217;m grateful to Lois&nbsp;Bruinooge, Executive Director of LGV, and her team for inviting us all out to commemorate the occasion. Following last week&#8217;s announcement of over half a million dollars in federal funding for our region&#8217;s state parks and wildlife conservation areas &#150; which included $94,250 to expand the Quinebaug River Wildlife Management Area within the Last Green Valley &#150; there was plenty to celebrate. Click here to learn more about the recently announced federal grant awards that will help bolster the Last Green Valley, and other state parks and conservation areas in our region.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you to the folks at Last Green Valley and Allen Hill Farm&nbsp;for hosting Saturday&#8217;s great event, and to everyone who joined us.&nbsp;I&#8217;m looking forward to another 25 great years!&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney at Allen Hill Farm last weekend celebrating 25 years of Last Green Valley     New Gap Financing Program for Homeowners with Crumbling Foundations  Last week, I joined Governor Lamont in announcing the launch of the Supplemental Collapsing Foundation Loan Program &#150; a new statewide program for homeowners with crumbling foundations that will allow for folks who have received assistance from the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company (CFSIC) to receive a loan from participating banks in Connecticut to cover other repairs.&nbsp;The new program will help to cover the cost of repairs that CFSIC isn&#8217;t able to cover.&nbsp;For example, if a deck, patio, or plumbing system needed to be destroyed or altered in order to repair a home&#8217;s foundation, CFSIC could help cover the cost of the foundation repair, and this new program could help cover the cost of repairing the deck, patio, plumbing system, etc.&nbsp;Homeowners can repay a loan from this program through the federal property casualty loss deduction &#150;&nbsp;for more&nbsp;information,&nbsp;visit&nbsp;my resource page&nbsp;online.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m working to find resources to&nbsp;respond to the crumbling foundations crisis at the local, state, and federal levels,&nbsp;and the new supplemental loan program is an important piece of the puzzle. However, one&nbsp;persisting gap in addressing the problem&nbsp;at every level&nbsp;has been a lack of reliable standards for evaluating what quantity of pyrrhotite must be present in concrete in order to pose a danger to a foundation&#8217;s structural integrity. The University of Connecticut and others have efforts underway to explore this missing element, but it&#8217;s clear that more research is needed to help affected homeowners and communities.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the House passed a spending package for FY2020 that included my amendment to provide NIST &#150; the leading federal expert in cement and concrete standards &#150; with $4 million to conduct research on the crumbling foundations crisis, to develop a standard testing method for at-risk homes and other structures for the presence of pyrrhotite, and to create a risk-rating scale so that homeowners, small businesses, and local governments have a better understanding of what quantity of pyrrhotite poses a danger to their foundation&#8217;s structural integrity. The Senate&#8217;s spending bill included $1.5 million for NIST to conduct this research, and now &#150; as the House and Senate are preparing to conference a final spending package &#150; we&#8217;re pushing for the research to be funded at the full $4 million agreed to here in the House.&nbsp;&nbsp;        Click here to read the full letter to the House appropriators      Community Discussion on the Lower Prescription Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp; On Wednesday, I hosted a panel discussion and community conversation at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Groton Senior Center to address the skyrocketing cost of prescription medication, and to highlight the work being done in Congress to give Americans a better deal on prescription drugs&nbsp;through bills like&nbsp;the Lower&nbsp;Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3).&nbsp; I&nbsp;was joined by an impressive&nbsp;group of regional healthcare experts to discuss how&nbsp;out-of-control&nbsp;drug prices&nbsp;are&nbsp;impacting&nbsp;people and families&nbsp;of all ages and from&nbsp;all&nbsp;from all walks of life, and to talk about&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;ways in which H.R. 3 would&nbsp;give Americans a better deal on prescription medication.&nbsp;The Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;would change the law by finally allowing for Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for fairer, lower drug prices&nbsp;-- the kind of prices they offer to other countries, but not to us. It would&nbsp;also&nbsp;charge drug manufacturers for a rebate if they increase the price of their drugs faster than inflation; it would create a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries; and&nbsp;it&nbsp;would reinvest savings into research at the National Institutes of Health, and into improving Medicare.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lower Drug Costs Now Act has a chance to be the most significant legislation on health care that the 116th Congress will accomplish. Prescription drug prices are out of control, and I&#8217;m proud that the House majority has made this issue one of our top priorities this year. In just the past few weeks, H.R. 3 was introduced, hearings were held, and my committee moved to approve the bill so that it can come before the full House of Representatives for a final vote. I&#8217;m grateful to Nora Duncan, Laura Hoch, and Judy Stein for joining me in Groton to talk more about the importance of passing this bill, and I&#8217;m looking forward to pressing ahead so that we can get H.R. 3 across the finish line once and for all.&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney speaking at Groton Senior Center this week on the Lower Drug Costs Now Act     Touring the Newly Upgraded New England Central Rail&nbsp; On Thursday morning, I was joined by officials from Genesee&nbsp;&amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W) and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) to tour the final upgrades of the New England Central Rail (NECR).&nbsp;These recently completed upgrades are an impressive sight, and&nbsp;they&#8217;ll provide firms and small businesses throughout our region with a real opportunity for economic success and growth.&nbsp; Over the past decade,&nbsp;our&nbsp;region has come together to secure federal funding&nbsp;to&nbsp;make much-needed upgrades to the NECR &#150; a rail line that&#8217;s about 100 years old, that until now hasn&#8217;t been able to move at high speeds or to tolerate heavier weights.&nbsp;In September 2014, my office helped secure an $8.3 million federal grant through the U.S. Department of Transportation to upgrade the NECR, which was the&nbsp;culmination of an effort that started five years earlier in 2009.&nbsp;In her article on the new upgrades and what they mean for our region&#8217;s economy, The Day&#8217;s Julia Bergman noted that the&nbsp;$8.3 million&nbsp;federal&nbsp;grant&nbsp;made up about 66% of the total project, while G&amp;W covered the remainder.  The completed project is a&nbsp;great achievement, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;means&nbsp;great things for our region. These upgrades will improve our freight rail service, will help&nbsp;relieve congested highways by&nbsp;getting&nbsp;big trucks off the road&nbsp;and&nbsp;placing more of that cargo onto rail lines, and will open up new&nbsp;economic&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;and frontiers&nbsp;for the many firms and small businesses here in eastern Connecticut who rely on the NECR to do business. We took a ride up the new rail line&nbsp;on Thursday, and it&#8217;s now smooth as silk &#150; no joints, no delays, no &#8216;clackety-clack&#8217; &#150; just a smooth ride. The new and improved NECR will make a big difference for the economy of our region, and I was proud to help secure the federal TIGER grant that made it happen&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney touring the final upgrades of the New England Center Rail     Thank you, as always, for taking the time to read this update. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance.

As a combat veteran myself, I am working tirelessly to ensure Congress is looking after our veterans and have introduced H.R. 4154, The Leave No Veteran Behind Act, *which would expand outreach at Veterans Affairs Health Centers. * *Watkins Marks Up H.R. 3 in Education and Labor Hearing* [image = In the House Committee on Education and Labor last week, my colleagues and I took the time to review Nancy Pelosi's Partisan Prescrition Drug Plan or *H.R. 3 (pictured above). *As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, I will always ensure easy and affordable access to health care is availalbe, and will stand up to the Speaker against her partisan plan for a government takeover of our healthcare system that would result in higher prescription drug prices and even the loss of many lives. Watkins Attends Problem Solvers Meeting* [image = During our bicameral, bipartisan problem-solvers caucus meetings last week *(pictured above)*, we discussed some of the most pertinent issues in our government today - trade, immigration, and the ongoing Turkish offensive in Syria.

Mark Warner to lead a bipartisan letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma, urging them to make CDC-recognized virtual Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) providers eligible for reimbursement in the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) expanded model. Including virtual providers would empower beneficiaries, regardless of their zip code, with feasible options for preventative, value-based care. In addition, including virtual DPP providers in the expanded MDPP and embracing digital health tools to empower patients would deliver better health outcomes and drive additional savings across the healthcare system. You can read more, including the full letter, here.  National Adoption Month On Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decided to repeal the regulation that threatened faith-based foster care and adoption agencies in South Carolina. It is fitting that this National Adoption Month, HHS has sided with our most vulnerable children in restoring the rights of the faith-based adoption agencies who care for them. South Carolinians can rest assured that their religious liberties are protected while we will continue to do everything we can to help our children find loving and nurturing homes. You can view the HHS announcement here.

I&#8217;m original cosponsor with Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) on this bipartisan legislative effort, which came through the Small Business Committee, on which I serve as Vice Ranking Member. This Act would reauthorize the much-needed SBDC program for four years. American Samoa&#8217;s SBDC is a partnership between the Small Business Administration and the American Samoa Community College. The program is based at the college, and offers business development counseling services. One of the reforms in the bill ensures that the funding only goes through proper academic entities, such as the Community College. I appreciate our Small Business Development Center as a resource here in American Samoa. These centers focus on helping entrepreneurs and our local small businesses. Most of the businesses on the island are small businesses, so we need programs that can help show the way to operating successfully. We can all help support and build up our neighboring businesses. I want to say thank you to SBDC Director Jason Betham and the team there: Catherine Balauro, Talalelei Pu'a, and Margaret Lilomaiava.   Soifua,   Member of Congress     &nbsp;    Federal Grants We welcomed a number of federal grants since our last newsletter  A Healthcare grant providing about $70,000 in support for maternal and child health services. Grants from the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), totaling $1,272,409 for American Samoa. Grant from the National Park Service (NPS) of $100,000 for improvements to the Lions Park in American Samoa through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), and highlighted recent congressional action that improved that program&#8217;s funding for the territories. A grant of $536,964 for American Samoa&#8217;s coral reef conservation through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Two discretionary federal grants for American Samoa, each through the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Department, for a total of nearly $520,000.    &nbsp;   House Passes Amata-Cosponsored Bill Reauthorizing Small Business Development Center Program Congresswoman Aumua Amata highlighted House passage of the Small Business Development Centers Improvements Act, H.R. 4406, which would reauthorize the much-needed SBDC program for four years.

The bill sponsored by Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) was introduced this week to help reestablish federal coordinated efforts aimed at helping women-owned businesses succeed.&nbsp; Read more    &nbsp;   Amata Highlights GAO Study Team on Island because of 2015 Congressional Action Washington, D.C. &#150; Monday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata highlighted congressional action from 2015 resulting in a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study team&#8217;s current efforts in American Samoa to report on the Territory&#8217;s minimum wage. Read more   I&#8217;m pictured here with the GAO team, including Senior Economist Emil Friberg, and some of Gov. Lolo&#8217;s team who are working with them. The GAO visit is a result of my 2015 bill, H.R. 2617 in the 114th Congress, amending the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. That Act is Public Law 114&#150;61, which tasks the GAO with a report on American Samoa&#8217;s minimum wage, changes in the cost of living, and the local economy. The purpose of the study is to know how the minimum wage in American Samoa lines up with the cost of living over time.   &nbsp;   Veterans Several actions on behalf of Veterans moved forward last month   Congresswoman Aumua Amata is welcoming House passage of several Veterans&#8217; bills, including two that she cosponsored.&nbsp; Read more Amata &amp; Colleagues Work to Make VA Grants Program Permanent.

While we work to address the rising cost of prescription drugs, secure our border, and pass USMCA, liberals in the House of Representatives are singularly focused on impeaching the President of the United States. October Washington Update In an effort to take a stand against this sham impeachment process, Republicans forced a vote on&nbsp;H.Res 660,&nbsp;Condemning and censuring Adam Schiff, Representative of California's 28th Congressional District.&nbsp;Among other things, the resolution condemned his re-telling of the president's call with the president of Ukraine, which in my view was little more than an attempt to mislead the American people. I co-sponsored and voted for the resolution, which Democrats voted down on the House floor.  California Congressman Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is leading the House's impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Do you believe a fair investigation is possible under these circumstances?  Yes   No   Unsure   &nbsp;Click to open in a separate window      --  After more than a month of secret hearings and selective leaking, Speaker Pelosi put a resolution on the House floor to establish rules for the impeachment inquiry. I voted against it because in my view, it was little more than an attempt to legitimize the unfair, hyper-partisan inquiry that was already underway. This resolution is a mirage &#150; an attempt to create the perception of fairness, transparency, and due process. In truth, this sham inquiry contains none of those cherished American values.&nbsp;  --  Despite impeachment-obsession, our economy continues to roar in the wake of pro-growth policies put in place by the president and prior Congresses. The September Jobs Report showed more jobs created, an unemployment rate at 3.5% - the lowest in half a century - and more wage growth for American workers. We can and should build on this success, and can do that by passing USMCA and addressing the rising cost of healthcare. Impeachment distracts from those goals.    Source: Council of Economic Advisers  --  This month, the House Committee on Ways and Means, of which I am a member, held a hearing on and advanced a Soviet-style prescription drug pricing bill. Unfortunately, it was not the bipartisan legislation that the Senate had been working on with the House for several months. It was the bill written by Speaker Pelosi that would give the federal government the power to dictate drug prices. There is a lot at risk with that strategy.&nbsp;The price of a drug only matters if it's on the shelf and available to patients, and government price-controls will discourage innovation and reduce supply of life-saving medicines.&nbsp;I oppose the Speaker's plan. I believe it will lead to fewer cures.        View this clip of my statement on what's at risk with H.R. 3     --  There was some great news in October, and I want to highlight a few things for you that are important to our region. First,&nbsp;The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2440, the Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act&nbsp;on October 28th.&nbsp;I am a co-author of this bill, which was based on legislation I wrote in 2017. Our nation&#8217;s ports and harbors, like the Port of Erie, are supposed to receive funding for dredging and other maintenance from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the revenue&nbsp;dedicated&nbsp;in the fund is not being used for that purpose. H.R. 2440 would fix that. Only in Washington would you need legislation to require money in a maintenance fund to go to maintenance! We're now working to get this bill through&nbsp;the Senate and to the president so we can get to work upgrading&nbsp;our ports.  Second, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Action Plan III of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), which includes a 5-year plan&nbsp;to accelerate the recovery of our Lakes. I am a proud supporter of GLRI, and a member of the Congressional Great Lakes Task Force. We can and must ensure that the Great Lakes are clean and safe for future generations and I support the EPA's mission to speed up that process.  October in Western Pennsylvania Western Pennsylvania is home to one of the largest shale deposits in the country, and thousands of our neighbors are employed by companies in the oil and gas industry. President Donald Trump visited Pittsburgh this month to meet with workers and celebrate the job growth that resulted from his administration's policies of deregulation. Not only have those policies led to more jobs, but America is energy independent and the number one exporter of energy in the world. When Americans are unleashed from onerous and unnecessary government controls, our workers and economic might are unmatched! I was proud to join my Pennsylvania colleagues and the president for the event, and honored to travel there on Air Force One as the president's guest.   Members of the PA delegation speak with the president about oil and gas policy on the way to Pittsburgh.  --  On October 25, my staff and I hosted our 2nd annual School Safety Seminar, which gathered together community leaders, school safety officers, teachers, and others responsible for protecting our kids to discuss strategies to achieve that goal. US Attorney Scott Brady, representatives from the FBI, Secret Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services were on hand to offer guidance on how to keep our children safe at school. It was a great event! If you would like more information about what was covered or have questions, don't hesitate to contact my Butler office, 724-282-2557.    Me welcoming attendees (left), my staff and members of the Pittsburgh Secret Service Office (center), and FBI Special Agent Gregg Frankhouser briefing attendees (right) --  Reminder: My staff and I can provide you with a variety of services, including help with federal agencies, guidance with federal grants, and more. I am happy to announce that we now offer notary services at all three district offices. Give us a call if we can help you with these things or any other matter.

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Senate Passes My CJS Appropriations Bill This week, the Senate passed my FY2020 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act with overwhelming support. This bill funds the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and many other agencies. Specifically, this legislation invests in federal law enforcement agencies, state and local law enforcement grants, space exploration, scientific research, economic development programs, trade enforcement, ocean observations, and weather forecasting. This CJS bill is fiscally responsible and prioritizes important federal programs that support economic development, law enforcement, and scientific innovation. I&#8217;m especially pleased that this bill accelerates the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon and cements America&#8217;s leadership in space exploration. I am proud to have worked closely with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to produce a good government, bipartisan bill that enables numerous agencies within our jurisdiction to accomplish their missions, keep communities safe, and address the needs of our nation.&#8221; Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch my remarks on this bill.&nbsp;  &nbsp;USDA Selects New Headquarters Location in Kansas City This week, USDA announced that 805 Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Kansas City has been selected as the new site for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). I&#8217;ve long advocated that USDA&#8217;s ERS and NIFA relocate to the Kansas City metropolitan area knowing that regardless of what side of the border these facilities would land, it would be a positive development for the regional economy and so many institutions across Kansas and Missouri. I applaud the many entities across Kansas City who have worked to bring these agencies closer to the producers they serve. In addition, I&#8217;m committed to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan, bicameral way to secure the resources necessary for USDA to complete this move and to welcome their employees to Kansas City. Questioning Boeing CEO on the 737 MAX and the Future of Aviation Safety On Tuesday, during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I had the opportunity to question Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg on important issues regarding the now-grounded Boeing 737 MAX airplane. It is critical we find out what went wrong and investigate current policies and protocols to ensure similar tragedies don&#8217;t happen again. As the aviation industry is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, I&#8217;m committed to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure safety in the aviation industry is always the top priority. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch our discussion.&nbsp;    Announcing NIST Grant to Pittsburg State University On&nbsp;Wednesday, I was pleased to announce a grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Kansas Technology Center at Pittsburg State University. This award will help establish a recyclable plastics modeling and testing laboratory, and will allow PSU to continue leading the region and the country in polymers and plastics research.&nbsp;In order to compete in a global economy and to protect our country from adversaries, it&#8217;s important our businesses and manufacturers remain on the cutting edge. As the chief appropriator for the U.S. Department of Commerce and NIST, I&#8217;ll continue working with PSU officials to grow their expertise in this important field.

With new technological advances coming seemingly every day, we must ensure our fans are being treated fairly. My&nbsp;BOTS Act, which was signed into law in 2016, would do just that. The&nbsp;BOTS Act&nbsp;prohibits ticket scalpers from using automated purchasing technology to quickly buy large amounts of event tickets before the average fan has an opportunity to make a purchase, ultimately decreasing consumer choice and driving up prices. In addition, we discussed my work with Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to protect Olympic and amateur athletes from abuse. I appreciate their thoughtful and productive conversation on how we can all work together &#150; regardless of position or responsibility &#150; to end the abuse of athletes.&nbsp;I will continue to work with the Sports Fans Coalition and my Senate colleagues to protect fans from those that wish to take advantage of their passion.    Discussing Infrastructure and Transportation with Civic Council of Greater KC On Monday, I had the opportunity to meet with the KC Civic Council &#150; a nonprofit organization composed of some of the largest, private employers in the Kansas City area. During the meeting, we discussed critical issues to the KC area including infrastructure, workforce and trade issues. The meeting gave us a chance to discuss my Startup Act legislation which encourages job creation, innovation and advances economic development. This legislation will encourage growth in the KC area by developing policies that help recruit and retain highly-skilled students and innovators, and enable entrepreneurs to transform their ideas into companies. The legislation is supported by a diverse group of industry in the KC area, and I look forward to continuing to push for its final passage.&nbsp;    Junction City Welcome Home Ceremony  On Saturday, I was honored to join our 1st Infantry Division soldiers and their families at Junction City's Welcome Home Celebration. During the celebration, it was announced that Junction City was awarded as one of this year&#8217;s Great American Defense Communities. And this celebration was evidence of why Junction City is known as one of the best Army hometowns in the country. Welcome home to Fort Riley soldiers who have been deployed across the globe over 2019, and a big thank you to the All American Beef Battalion for serving our active duty soldiers at the event.    Hosting a Ness County Townhall Meeting On Friday, I was in Ransom to host a Ness County Listening Tour Stop. During this stop, we discussed a number of issues including veterans&#8217; access to healthcare and implementation of the&nbsp;VA MISSION Act, agriculture and the importance of passing USMCA, our work to make certain rural America can thrive, the ongoing impeachment proceedings, challenges in rural healthcare delivery and border security. Thanks to all those who took time to visit with me on Friday, and thank you to Herb Schwartzkopf and the Ransom VFW for hosting my visit to the community.    Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

Showcasing America on the World StageThe World Expo is an incredible international event that brings together cultures from around the globe. Ensuring the United States has a presence there to showcase America &#151; in particular Houston &#151; is incredibly important. That is why I&nbsp;worked with Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN)&nbsp;H.R. 4842, the Expositions Provide Opportunities Act of 2019. This bill ensures America has a place at the 2020 World Expo that will take place in Dubai. Participating in this global endeavor sets the stage for Houston to compete to be a future host of the event. It also allows us to show people across the globe why our great Texas city has emerged as a top destination for worldwide events. You can read&nbsp;my full&nbsp;statement here.  Combatting Domestic ViolenceOctober marked National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, where we shine a light on this darkness that affects people of all walks of life. As co-chair of the Victims' Rights Caucus, I&#8217;m proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress to denounce and put a stop to this heinous act. No one should ever be the victim of violence by their spouse or significant other. If you or a loved one are a victim of domestic violence, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. Working together we can end domestic violence once and for all.         Olson with the Victims' Rights Caucus standing in solidarity with domestic violence survivors    Taking Action Against TurkeyTurkish forces have engaged in a ruthless&nbsp;attack&nbsp;against our Kurdish allies, with many of them being civilians. While I did not agree&nbsp;with the decision to draw down our military presence, I do believe sanctions against Turkey for&nbsp;their&nbsp;abhorrent actions are needed.&nbsp;Last week, I voted for the bipartisan bill H.R. 4695, the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act,&nbsp;which holds Turkey accountable for their invasion of&nbsp;northeast Syria against the Kurds. I&#8217;m proud to support these sanctions that apply needed pressure on Turkey to end its offensive, while also requiring the Trump Administration to develop a plan to ensure the ISIS detainees held at Syrian facilities remain imprisoned. Our allies, our national security and our reputation on the world stage require nothing less. You can read&nbsp;my full statement here.  Giving Medicare Recipients Real-Time Price ToolsSeniors deserve transparency when it comes to the costs of their prescription drugs. Sadly, more Americans are leaving the pharmacy without needed medicine thanks to skyrocketing and often-times unexpected drug costs.   I'm&nbsp;pleased to announce that in&nbsp;the House, we&nbsp;passed&nbsp;a package of healthcare bills&nbsp;that included&nbsp; a bill I worked on called the Shop Rx Act of 2019. This bill will give physicians real-time information on prescription drug prices so that&nbsp;they and their patients can make informed decisions on treatment options. This package of bills are now headed to the Senate for consideration.&nbsp;Read my statement&nbsp;about the Shop Rx Act here.  I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

Peterson - Minnesota's Seventh Congressional District [image = *Joining my colleagues to introduce the Farm Worker Modernization Act of 2019* *Dear Friends [link 3], a website that can help connect people looking for treatment with 13,000 locations across the United States. I've heard from countless constituents and health care professionals in the 7th district about the need for mental health and substance abuse services, and increased access to health care professionals in rural communities. * Chairman's Corner* [image = On Wednesday, I convened the full House Committee on Agriculture to consider legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) [link 4]. The CFTC authorization expired in 2013, so its reauthorization is overdue, and I am glad to see we are on a bipartisan path to get it done. The legislation was unanimously approved by the Committee and can now be considered by the full House of Representatives. The bipartisan cooperation of House Agriculture Committee members sends a strong message to the Senate, who should consider this legislation once it passes on the House floor. [image = The Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture and Research heard from organic farmers about the state of their industry last week. Farmers from across the U.S. shared their experiences producing vegetables, dairy and flowers organically. During their testimony, the growers shared some of the benefits and challenges of organic farming. They discussed the importance of maintaining soil health and the practices they use to do so. They also discussed the importance of maintaining strong standards for both domestic and imported organic products. The 2018 Farm Bill included provisions to expand the Organic Agricultural Research and Extension Initiative, to support the collection of data related to organic farming, and it directed the USDA Secretary to mandate a national standard for imported organic products. * Crop Insurance and Reinsurance Bureau* [image = On Wednesday, I met with a group of crop insurance company and agency representatives who were in DC with the Crop Insurance and Reinsurance Bureau (CIRB). We talked about how crop insurance has been helping farmers through the wet weather during harvest season and the prevent planting situation from earlier this year. I've heard from many farmers in my district who are doing all they can to get their crops out of the field, and it's very important that crop insurance companies and agents provide flexibility where they can in this situation. * Agriculture Labor Reform Legislation Introduced* I joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers to introduce the Farm Worker Modernization Act of 2019 [link 5] last week. This legislation will provide agricultural operations with access to a legal and stable workforce, including a year-round visa program for dairies. Agriculture needs a reliable and legal source of workers and I appreciate the bipartisan group of members who worked with agriculture groups to create this bill that will move the conversation forward. I am also glad to have the support of the 7th district's dairy industry for this legislation. \"Labor continues to be one of the biggest items holding dairy farmers back. In a time of high stress, labor availability can truly be the difference between a farm making it to next year or not. Minnesota's dairy farmers thank Rep. Collin Peterson, Rep. Angie Craig, and the over 40 other original co-sponsors of the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act. If passed, this bill finally provides dairy farmers access to the same pool of labor many in agriculture have utilized for decades. We look forward to a real dairy immigration program that considers the needs of both employee and employer for a successful relationship.\" said *Lucas Sjostrom**, Executive Director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association.* \"As a dairy farmer, I milk cows all year long, as opposed to harvesting a crop at a specific time of year,\" added *Bruce Maas**, an Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI) dairy farmer from Redwood County.* \"I am grateful to Chairman Peterson for recognizing the unique labor challenges that dairy faces and working with Republicans and Democrats alike to push forward legislation that addresses dairy's workforce needs by allowing farmers like to me access a revamped guest worker program.\" \"Securing access to a stable workforce is absolutely vital to the future of the dairy industry. As a dairy farmer, I milk cows 365 days a year, rain or shine or snow, so the current H2A seasonal guestworker program simply does not work for me and other dairy farmers,\" said *Brad Vold**, a dairy farmer in Pope County and Land O'Lakes, Inc. co-op member.* \"I commend Chairman Peterson for his bipartisan work in advancing legislation that helps solve dairy's unique workforce challenges by allowing dairy to access the H2A program.\" \"I applaud Representative Peterson for joining a bi-partisan effort to secure a stable labor force for agriculture,\" said *Casey Schlauderaff**, a Detroit Lakes dairy farmer and Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) co-op member.* \"By cosponsoring the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, he continues to demonstrate his commitment to dairy farmers, ensuring we have the tools we need to succeed - a stable labor force, access to foreign markets and price risk management tools. Minnesota's farmers are well represented by Chairman Peterson, and we appreciate his dedication to our success.\" Click here to read a summary of the bill. [link 6] * Energy and Commerce Subcommittee Hearing* On Tuesday, an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee held a legislative hearing to discuss my bill, H.R. 3006, the *RFS Integrity Act*. This important policy proposal will bring much-needed certainty back into the renewable fuels market place and prevent the EPA from making secret deals with companies that seek to avoid their biofuel blending requirements. Witnesses included an Iowa farmer, a National Biodiesel Board representative, the CEO of an ethanol trade association, and an oil coalition representative. You can watch a video of the hearing here [link 7]. * House Veterans' Affairs Committee* [image = On Tuesday, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs met to consider and mark up ten pieces of legislation. The legislation included a bill that would establish comprehensive reforms at the VA to address women veterans' access to healthcare, benefits, and other resources while also initiating reports and studies to identify areas for improvement on these matters. The Committee noted that there are approximately two million women veterans in the United States today. Other bills considered during the markup dealt with adjusting requirements for VA construction projects and updating the GI Bill Comparison Tool that provides information on schools. Some of the bills are aimed at protecting family members of fallen servicemembers by allowing them to do things such as terminate cell phone contracts or residential leases if the servicemember has been killed in the line of duty. All bills were passed out of committee by voice vote. * AIPAC* [image = While I was at a markup at the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) visited with my office about the importance of the U.S-Israel relationship. As a follow up to the meeting, I agreed to join a bipartisan letter which urges the UN to enforce existing resolutions to work with the Lebanese government to disarm groups that are not under the government's control. The presence of heavily armed militants positioned in Lebanon threatens the stability of the region. * Economic Development Commission for Kandiyohi County and the City of Willmar* [image = Two representatives from the Economic Development Commission in Kandiyohi County stopped by my office to discuss the continuing need for broadband in Western Minnesota. Broadband is a necessity for any community to succeed in education, telemedicine, agriculture, or business. I am committed to finding bipartisan solutions that will bring internet connectivity to every household. * United Steelworkers* [image = Representatives from Minnesota chapters of the United Steelworkers visited my office to discuss the state of labor in Minnesota and movement on the *Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act*, which I cosponsored and passed in the House earlier this year. I am working to protect large multiemployer pensions from insolvency and will continue to work with Members on both sides of the aisle so workers can keep their hard earned retirement benefits. * Blue Ribbon Ceremony at Lincoln Elementary* [image = Lincoln Elementary in Alexandria is one of ten schools in Minnesota that was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School. At a ceremony on Tuesday, my staff presented principal Brendon Bogart with a U.S. flag that was flown over the Capitol. * Round Table with Governor Walz in East Grand Forks* * [image = Minnesota Governor Tim Walz came to East Grand Forks to hear what the disastrous wet weather has done to our harvest. Governor Walz was joined by several others, including Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen, Commissioner of Management and Budget Myron Frans, Minnesota Director of Homeland Security Joe Kelly, and State Director of the Farm Service Agency Joe Martin. Staff from my office, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Smith's office were able to join the meeting. They discussed the need for more timely propane availability and a reasonable working relationship with the State Patrol as farmers struggle to complete harvest. Farmers expressed worry about their financial future and how that would impact others in towns beyond themselves. There was no doubt that this year will leave many farm families financially strapped. * Enbridge Pipeline 3* [image = My staff aide LeRoy Stumpf attended a meeting in Mahnomen on Enbridge's Line 3 Pipeline replacement. The new pipeline will be thicker than the current pipeline. Enbridge is working with the local communities to train and hire local people for this project. * Ortonville Water Tower* [image = Ortonville Economic Development Authority held a contest for the design of their new water tower which was recently finished. The Economic Development Authority had 101 submissions. * Living Memories of World War II in Norway* [image = Rev. Aamen Gjovik from Fargo shared stories from his childhood during the Nazi occupation of Norway. Aamen was born in Knaben, Norway which had a molybdenum mine, the only one in Europe. The Nazis wanted this metal to make their tanks much more difficult to penetrate. Many of Aamen's family members were forced to work in these mines under harsh conditions. Not too far from Knaben was Rjukan, Norway where the Vermork Hydro Electric plant operated to make heavy water to cool nuclear reactors. The Nazis wanted this heavy water to speed up their development of the atomic bomb and was eventually sabotaged by the Norwegian Resistance. The Nazis moved all the heavy water to ships to send it to Germany and the Norwegian Resistance sunk the ships. Aamen Gjovik said it was a hard existence for his family. [image = Legislation needs to be passed to keep the government operating through November 21st. Unlike during the last shutdown, which was technically a partial government shutdown because some departments had funding while others did not, should additional legislation not pass we would face a full shutdown. Survey to shop and save on insurance plans. * Epilepsy Awareness Month* November is Epilepsy Awareness Month. Epilepsy is a medical condition that affects approximately 1 in 26 people - one of the most common neurological disorders. Spreading awareness about epilepsy is an important way to recognize this disorder and help support people living with epilepsy. * USDA Announces Hemp Program* The United States Department of Agriculture announced the establishment of the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program last Wednesday. The 2018 Farm Bill included provisions allowing American farmers to produce hemp and this rule will increase regulatory certainty for these farmers. The interim rule includes information relating to the development of state and tribal hemp management plans, record keeping requirements, hemp testing and disposal standards, and licensing requirements.

I am disappointed in my Democratic colleagues' resolution that will continue to keep the impeachment hearings behind closed doors, and will give Chairman Schiff more power to create partisanship in a process that should be open and fair.&nbsp;  On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee announced six closed-door hearings for this Monday and Tuesday. This is why I voted 'no' on the Impeachment Resolution, because we can already see this resolution did not create openness or fairness.&nbsp;  Arizonans do not have an elected official on the Intelligence Committee, therefore, every Arizonan is being deprived information about the most serious investigation Congress can pursue against a President.&nbsp;  While the closed-door hearings continue, I will be working on behalf of all Arizonans. Here is a review of our week in Washington, D.C.:&nbsp;  Economy Exceeds Expectations   Treasury receipts rose again in the month of September, the last month of Fiscal Year 2019. Overall, receipts in Fiscal Year 2019 increased 4% from the previous year, well above expectations from the Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is great economic news to go alongside the October Jobs Report released Friday, which showed 128,000 jobs added into the economy.  By continuing to add thousands of jobs, our economy is showing us that hiring remains resilient and the job market is strong despite other factors such as labor strikes and disputes. Unemployment is staying close to a 50-year low at 3.6%, which is helping to fill all of the jobs we are adding.&nbsp;Unemployment in October also rose slightly from September, a positive indication that a higher percentage of the population is working or looking for work and participating in the labor force. Economists could have never predicted we would have more jobs available than workers to fill them. By passing pro-growth policies at the end of 2017, we are seeing wage-increases, low unemployment, and strong labor force participation.&nbsp; I spoke on the House Floor about this economic news and what policies we should be using as mechanisms to help improve our ballooning budget deficit. To watch the House floor speech, click here  Meeting with Constituents&nbsp;   We hosted an Open House for constituent groups and families to come by while they are visiting Washington, D.C. It is always great to meet with Arizonans while working on the East Coast and hearing about how our office can help best support Arizonans.  Expanding Telehealth Services I introduced the Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) for Health Act with my colleagues on the Congressional Telehealth Caucus, Representatives Mike Thompson, Peter Welch, and Bill Johnson.&nbsp;  This bipartisan piece of legislation was introduced in the House and Senate to help expand access to important telehealth services that can lower health costs and make health care more efficient for patients.&nbsp;  Whether you are in a suburban,&nbsp;rural, or urban area of the United States, your healthcare access should not be limited. Ensuring Americans have access to innovative healthcare technologies, at an affordable cost, is of upmost importance in our discussion of how we are providing care. We are seeing a revolution in the cost and delivery of healthcare, and now government is taking the right step to remove harmful barriers we have in place.  I am pleased to see the CONNECT for Health Act be introduced, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this critical piece of legislation.&nbsp;  Following Up on H.R. 3  In the past few newsletters I have touched on the harmful effects of passing Speaker Pelosi's drug pricing proposal, H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019. H.R. 3 would impose an excise tax on a drug if the manufacturer doesn't agree to the government imposed price, therefore, placing them in \"non-compliance.\" This tax could soar up as high as 95% on hundreds of life-saving and life-preserving drugs. The graph above shows that a $100 drug could face an excise tax penalty of $1,900 from non-compliance under this legislation. There are up to 250 drugs, including cures for cancer, hepatitis C, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, that could face this penalty.&nbsp; This is an extremely harmful policy to be implementing in our healthcare industry. I urge my colleagues to take this legislation back to the drawing board to work in a bipartisan manner and address these concerns, similar to the bipartisan legislation that passed out of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee.&nbsp; Veterans History Project  We must always honor our veterans who fought for our freedoms.

The House Leadership has spent the past 35 days selectively leaking information to the press from their private investigation in order to cause a media frenzy and sway public opinion. Now under pressure, they are coming to the table with a resolution to move forward with the promise of some transparency, despite the fact that the resolution does not require the proceedings to be open and transparent. The resolution also does not allow the President to be represented in the proceedings in a meaningful way, which was the case for Presidents Nixon and Clinton. This measure is a political stunt, rather than a legitimate attempt to conduct a fair and transparent process. And I will not participate in it.  Of specific concern, the impeachment process outlined in the resolution is bifurcated, with one committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), conducting its proceedings in the shadows while another committee, Judiciary, votes on articles it has not investigated.   This resolution states that the President and his Counsel are afforded protections throughout Judiciary Committee Proceedings, but not during the ongoing HPSCI investigation. The resolution does not require Chairman Schiff to release all materials acquired by HPSCI during its investigation to the Judiciary Committee. This means the President and his Counsel will be unable to review all the evidence submitted, question all witnesses, or object to certain evidence. The President and the Judiciary Committee will only be able to consider evidence that the Chairman of the HPSCI decides to transmit. This creates the possibility that only evidence that condemns the President will be transmitted, with exculpatory evidence being forced aside. No defendant in any proceeding should be treated this way. While the procedures adopted by the Rules Committee on behalf of the Judiciary Committee include similar protections for the President as were adopted during the impeachment proceedings for Presidents Nixon and Clinton, those same protections do not extend to the entire impeachment investigation as they have in the past. Finally, the procedures, unlike those adopted in the Clinton and Nixon impeachments, allow Chairman Nadler to unilaterally eliminate any of the protections afforded to the President if he perceives the President to be uncooperative with the investigation. Republicans offered 17 amendments in the Rules Committee prior to the vote, but they were ALL rejected.  Despite this impeachment-related circus, my sense is that the American public expects more from its leaders than the inflammatory discourse that has dominated the headlines in recent months, and I remain committed to working on the real issues that affect the day to day lives of my constituents. I am proud that we were able to make some progress on items last week which will actually help solve problems facing our country. Continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts on your behalf.  Learning from You  Tomorrow (Monday, November 4, 2019) night at 6:00 p.m., I will be hosting a tele-town hall. This forum allows a maximum number of constituents to participate. On average, several thousand constituents join in each tele-town hall for the entire hour-long exchange. This is just one of the multiple ways that I communicate with my constituents on a regular basis. I look forward to the opportunity to provide a brief update of what I have been working on in Washington and answer your questions. The system will be randomly dialing constituents; however, if you want to ensure your participation, you can call in directly at 1-888-480-3641.  Defeating Evil and Keeping Americans Safe  Last weekend&#8217;s successful operation leading to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the culmination of years of dedicated and coordinated effort to root out terrorism. Al-Baghdadi and the cowards around him are responsible for horrific and depraved violence, including the deaths of Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller. There is no place on earth for these cowards to hide, as we remain steadfast in our resolve to decimate ISIS and other terrorist organizations. May God continue to bless the men and women in our Armed Forces who are on the front lines in the War Against Terror. Their continued service and sacrifice help to keep our nation safe!  As co-Chairman of the Humane Bond Caucus, I have had the privilege to advocate on behalf of our military hero dogs. This hero dog is credited with helping our Special Forces unit in its successful mission to hunt down the ISIS terror leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. These well-trained animals are an incredible asset to our military, and we must always ensure they are treated with dignity and respect.   Another part of keeping America safe is holding our supposed allies accountable. Sadly, we have seen over the last several years, under Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s leadership, that Turkey has not consistently met this standard. Last week, the House took bold action in defense of our nation by passing measures regarding Turkey&#8217;s nefarious role in destabilizing the Middle East. The Protect Against Conflict by Turkey (PACT) Act, which I co-sponsored, enacts sanctions against Turkey for its egregious conduct. Turkey&#8217;s actions in Syria have caused numerous civilian deaths, worsened the existing humanitarian crisis, and further destabilized the region. This is not the behavior that we expect from a so-called American ally. In fact, the only entities which stand to benefit from Turkey&#8217;s actions are known bad actors on the international stage who do not have America&#8217;s best interests at heart, such as Vladimir Putin, Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Islamic extremists. We must hold Turkey accountable for its flagrant disregard for U.S. interests, and send a strong message to the international community that we are serious when it comes to defending our national security. Click&nbsp;here to watch me speak about this important matter on the House Floor.&nbsp;  Preventing Suicide  Last week I&nbsp;filed bipartisan legislation with Congressman Engel to help combat the recent spike in the national suicide rate. Since 2001, the suicide rate in the United States has risen by a shocking 31%, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death in the nation, with an estimated 47,000 lives lost each year. To curb this growing problem, the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act will fund grants to assist emergency departments in developing protocols for identifying, assessing and treating individuals at risk for suicide.  This proactive approach is vital because emergency departments are often the first, and sadly too often the only, point of contact within the healthcare system for those most at risk for suicide, such as those with severe mental health conditions or substance use disorders. A 2016 study found that 11% of all emergency department patients exhibited suicidal ideation. However, only 3% of those patients were diagnosed by current screening tools. Additionally, statistics show that up to 70% of patients who leave the emergency department after a suicide attempt never attend their first outpatient follow-up appointment.  These staggering statistics make it clear that we need improved methods for identifying and assessing the suicide risks of emergency department patients. As part of my long-term commitment to fixing our broken mental health care system, I want to be sure that we enhance the procedures surrounding the discharge of patients who have attempted suicide or exhibit suicidal ideation to maximize the likelihood that they obtain appropriate follow-up care. Our bill is the first step in making that happen.   Helping Seniors  Last week, I was proud to vote in favor of the Dignity in Aging Act which improves and reauthorizes the Older Americans Act (OAA). OAA has helped provide social and nutrition services to seniors for more than 50 years. In addition to well-known programs like Meals on Wheels, the OAA helps more than 41 million Americans maintain independence, prevent costly hospitalizations and live longer, healthier lives.   Additionally, Medicare Open Enrollment began November 1. In the state of Florida, SHINE provides counseling about the options available to seniors. SHINE is a non-profit organization funded by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs. Call 1800-96-ELDER if you (or a senior in your life) need additional help determining which options will best meet your needs. You can also watch this brief&nbsp;video from the Department of Health and Human Services to learn about changes for the upcoming year.&nbsp; Advocating for our Nation&#8217;s Heroes  I am once again partnering with local dentists and Pasco Hernando State College to provide free dental care to Veterans in our community this Friday, November 8, 2019. A limited number of appointments are available to Veterans in need for cleanings, fillings and extractions. Please contact my office at 727-232-2921 if you need these services.   Last week, I was proud to vote in favor of the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act of 2019, which passed the House. This bill sets up a Veteran Treatment Court program at the Department of Justice, providing grants and assistance to state &amp; local entities for Veteran treatment courts. Our community already has a robust treatment court that works with a significant number of Veterans in need of help. I&#8217;ve seen how well the program works and believe it should be expanded throughout the nation in order to assist our heroes.   In last week&#8217;s VA Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee&#8217;s hearing we&nbsp;examined the implementation of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act and the VA&#8217;s decision to delay processing the benefits until the new year. While I appreciate the VA&#8217;s commitment to get the job done the right way, I remain concerned by the potential for further processing delays &#150; these Veterans have waited long enough.  Last week&#8217;s VA Committee mark-up hearing was also frustrating. We usually place the needs of Veterans above partisan politics; however, the Chairman deviated from that tradition. I was saddened that the Chairman refused to allow debate and amendments to strengthen legislation that would support Veterans at-risk of suicide, remove barriers to mental health care for Veterans, and protect Veterans&#8217; children from child predators. These amendments are supported by Veterans Service Organizations and were offered by Members of Congress who are themselves Veterans. In the future, I hope my colleagues will return to our time-honored tradition of leaving politics at the door when it comes to doing the right thing for Veterans.  Improving Healthcare  Each year I hold a Nurses&#8217; roundtable event to get feedback from those on the front lines of our healthcare system about how Congress can improve the quality of care patients receive. This year, local nurses asked that I help push for the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act. I became a co-sponsor of this important initiative and I am proud to share that it passed the House last week. This important bill will reauthorize federal nursing workforce development grant programs for another five years. Programs include traineeships, loan repayment, and scholarships for nurses to attain advance practice status and become nursing faculty. Continued investment in these programs is necessary to ensure the U.S. has an adequate supply of nurses. Nurses are a critical component of our healthcare system, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to expedite passage of this essential legislation.   I am also proud that another bill I co-sponsored passed the House last week. The Payment Commission Data Act of 2019 will help remove a bureaucratic impediment that currently keeps Congress from receiving the best possible information needed for decision-making on issues related to Medicare and Medicaid. There are existing non-partisan Commissions responsible for making recommendations to Congress about Medicare and Medicaid programs. Currently, these Commissions do not have access to drug pricing data, which limits their ability to analyze and provide information on related topics to Congress, such as issues related to prescription drug costs. Our bill fixes this problem.  Additionally, last week the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced the launch of a website to help connect Americans looking for substance abuse treatment with approximately 13,000 treatment locations across the nation. This is one important step as we seek to improve access to care. Visit&nbsp; to learn more.  Preparing Future Leaders   A special thanks to the members of my Service Academy Nominating Committee. These men and women have proudly served our nation in the military, and are now volunteering their time to interview local candidates who would like to attend a Military Service Academy. Each year I receive dozens of applications from highly qualified young men and women who are seeking my nomination to an Academy. The Nominating Committee has the unenviable job of selecting the best and brightest among a group of elite students. I am confident that they will do an excellent job, and I look forward to meeting the future leaders they select.    Promoting Tourism  Last week, I was able to take a lead role in the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee&#8217;s Legislative Hearing on the Reauthorization of Brand USA. This critical program has a proven track record of success in bringing international tourists to the U.S. without using tax dollars. Its reauthorization is vital.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;here to listen to my remarks.&nbsp; Remaining Competitive   In last week&#8217;s Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing we discussed the fact that China and South Korea are gaining a competitive edge with respect to 5G deployment and the Internet of Things. Click&nbsp;here to listen to my exchange on this topic. It is important that the United States continues to be in a position of strength by quickly reallocating spectrum to the companies on the front lines of emerging technology and innovation.&nbsp;  Setting the Record Straight  I am proud that the United States set the historic record&nbsp;straight by officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide last week. Turkey has for too long denied the historic fact that 1.5 million Armenians and other ethnic and religious minorities were killed by the Ottoman Empire, and the United States will no longer let this historic inaccuracy stand.&nbsp;  Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent in Wesley Chapel. Though his issue was not involving a federal agency, my team was able to reach out to the Florida Insurance Commissioner on his behalf to request consideration of their families situation.  &#8220;I am happy to update that our claim against the Insurance company has been resolved. They are reinstating the original policy that was cancelled and there will be no Pre-Existing Condition prior to my wife&#8217;s heart attack. The premiums paid for the replacement policy have been applied retroactively to the original policy. That was always the only thing we wanted, out of fairness. The agent who &#8220;bait-n-switched&#8221; her to another policy 10 days before her heart attack, has been terminated from doing business with the company. Thank you for your efforts.&#8221;  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  Last week, my team met with the leadership of the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#8217;s Office to check on the progress of the new Veteran&#8217;s Pod in the local jail. I am pleased to continue my collaboration with Sheriff Chronister on this project and was glad to see Veteran-created art being hung on the walls of the new pod. I believe that with the great work of the mental health professionals from USF and the Sheriff&#8217;s willingness to work outside the box, we will see meaningful change in the lives of these Veterans.   My team also met with the leadership staff for the regional VA to hear a status report on the implementation of key policy initiatives and program improvements. I will continue to work closely with the VA, both in Washington and at home, to ensure our Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.   My team was fortunate to participate in a Hospitality and Tourism Roundtable discussion in Wesley Chapel last week. As co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Travel and Tourism, I know that tourism is such an important part of our local, state and national economy. It was great to see these leaders sharing ideas about how they can work together to boost tourism throughout Tampa Bay.   Additionally, My team was pleased to attend the Grand Opening Of the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators (NCCCO) with other members of the Greater Palm Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce. NCCCO is a nonprofit organization formed in 1995 with a mission to develop performance standards for safe crane operation to assist all segments of general industry and construction.

If you have friends or family members who would like to subscribe, please share with them the following&nbsp;LINK.  DOWN IN WASHINGTON  This week, I was appointed&nbsp;to the House Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation. In the 21st century, cybersecurity is a critical component of our national security strategy.&nbsp;As a physician, I am particularly excited to work on protecting American patients and the health care community from cybersecurity threats. Click here to read the Somerset Daily American's&nbsp;coverage of my appointment.  Too many people in PA and across the country are preyed upon by bad actors.&nbsp;As our nation is increasingly targeted by bad actors, it is an honor to join this group of Members who are committed to identifying, preventing, and combating threats to our nation&#8217;s cyber infrastructure. Earlier this week, I released a video message about National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which concluded on October 31. Click the picture below to&nbsp;watch my remarks on cybersecurity awareness.&nbsp;    ***  On Monday, I took to the House floor to recognize&nbsp;National First Responders Day and thank the firefighters, police officers, EMTs, and all emergency personnel who serve our communities. Recently, it was my privilege to announce that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded nearly $3 million to PA-13 first responders to obtain much-needed equipment and training. Click the picture below to&nbsp;watch my remarks.    ***&nbsp;  This week, I had the opportunity to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the potential benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for PA-13.&nbsp;   ***  Cancer doesn't discriminate on party lines. This week, I was grateful to join a bipartisan group of Members of Congress to highlight the importance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month&nbsp;as we reaffirm our commitment to patients and survivors.   ***  It was a pleasure to speak with&nbsp;Timothy Liezert, Network 4 Director of VA Healthcare, this week. He gave me an update on the work the VA is doing in Pennsylvania to serve our veterans.   ***  On Thursday, I voted no on H.Res. 660, House Democrats&#8217; partisan impeachment inquiry resolution. Facing mounting criticism for this Soviet-style process, House Democrats produced their impeachment inquiry resolution under the guise of transparency. From the beginning, this unprecedented inquisition has been a breathless political tactic that denies President Trump due process and robs elected Members of Congress of the ability to fulfill their Constitutional responsibilities.&nbsp;  After the vote, I spoke to the&nbsp;Altoona Mirror.

The death of this depraved individual is a huge win for America and all the civilized world, and it sends a clear message to those that would use terrorism to pursue their evil ends that they cannot escape the long and mighty arm of the United States military. I thank our President for his decisive leadership in ordering this raid and our special operatives for their courage and bravery in undertaking this extremely dangerous operation.  Tricking the American People From Day 1 of Donald Trump's presidency, House Democrats have tried dressing up their impeachment inquisition as a legitimate inquiry instead of what it really is: a purely political ploy aimed at discrediting and destroying our duly-elected President. That&#8217;s why it is only fitting on Halloween, Democrats tried to put a costume of credibility to disguise their political witch hunt of Donald J. Trump and distract from their radical, socialist policies &#150; which should scare all Americans.  House Democrats&#8217; relentless pursuit of this impeachment scam is hurting our ability to get things done on behalf of the American people like passing USMCA and passing legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. In fact, this Congress, Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have had bills signed into law. It&#8217;s past time for Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s political theater to exit stage left so we can get back to doing our jobs, debating the real issues, and solving real problems.  Bringing the Prescription Drug Pricing Process Out of the Darkness All Americans are rightly concerned about the ever-rising costs of prescription drugs. One of the reasons why drug costs have spiraled out of control is because discounts negotiated by the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)&#150; the middle-men in the drug supply chain &#150; are shrouded in secrecy. Americans are left in the dark about the rebates these PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers, and while we have no idea where the rebate value is going, we know where it&#8217;s not going &#150; to our seniors at the point of sale.  To that end, I&#8217;m proud this week the House passed bipartisan legislation I led that provides more transparency in an otherwise opaque process that will help ensure rebates go towards reducing the cost of drugs for seniors. This legislation also includes the text of my bill, the Shop Rx Act, which requires drug plans for seniors to offer real-time information regarding the various options of drugs and their associated costs. By providing seniors with access to the readily available, relevant information they need in order to be real consumers in the healthcare market, we will empower them with the knowledge to choose the options that best fit their needs and their budget. And because consumers will have more information, they will have more choices and insurers will have to actually compete for their business, which will ultimately bring down the cost of drugs- something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on.

Ushering in American Energy Dominance At the heart of America&#8217;s economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy. American energy independence is undoubtedly a matter of national security, but it's also a question of life &amp; death for our rural communities. In West Texas, energy producers are as crucial to our communities as our educators, healthcare providers, &amp; ag producers. Click here to watch my remarks opposing HR 2181, Democrat-led legislation that would ban future mineral development in an area outside the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which would put a choke-hold on energy production by our New Mexico neighbors and members of the Navajo Nation tribe.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs We continue to see more great news come out about our economy, which was once again confirmed with the latest jobs report. October&#8217;s numbers showed the economy added 128,000 jobs last month, exceeding economists&#8217; expectations. This is just goes to show that President Trump and Republicans&#8217; pro-growth policies have brought greater freedom in the marketplace are helping Americans keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets where it belongs. Now it&#8217;s time to keep our foot on the pedal by passing USMCA and ushering in the 176,000 new jobs that this better, fairer trade deal will deliver.  Hometown Hero Earlier this week, Lubbock Police Department Officer Thomas Thompson, a finalist for the Police Officer of the Year Award, was honored by President Trump at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in Chicago. Officer Thompson is part of a long line of defenders of our democracy as guardians of the public safety and the Rule of Law, and we are all grateful to his bravery and service to keeping the Lubbock community secure and our families safe.

Red Raider Nation It was also a pleasure to meet with students from Texas Tech who are interning here in our nation&#8217;s capital.

This week's episode highlights&nbsp;No Budget, No Pay&nbsp;legislation:&nbsp;If members of Congress fail to do their jobs, which includes passing a budget on time, they shouldn&#8217;t get a taxpayer-funded salary.&nbsp;  Senator Scott is proud to sponsor the No Budget, No Pay Act, which simply requires Congress to pass an annual budget and meet appropriations bill deadlines, or forgo their own salaries until the job is done. There is no reason members of Congress should be held to a different standard than American families and businesses across the nation, and Senator Scott will continue to fight for this commonsense reform.

Rick Scott Statement on Baghdadi&#8217;s Death  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump&#8217;s announcement of the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Senator Rick Scott&nbsp;said, &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement of the killing of Baghdadi &#150; one of the most notorious terrorists in the world &#150; is great news for the security of the United States and our allies. I want to thank our men and women in uniform that carried out this mission and continue to fight for freedom around the world. This is an important step in the fight to defeat ISIS, a terrorist group that inspired the Pulse terrorist attack and that is responsible for the deaths of thousands around the world, including Floridian Steven Sotloff.&nbsp;  &#8220;To the enemies of the United States, this is yet another reminder that there is nowhere you can go, there is nowhere you can hide. We will not stop until justice is served. Today the world is a little safer, a little kinder, a little more free.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Introduces Amendments to Put American National Security First  Senator Rick Scott announced two amendments to the package of spending bills currently before the Senate to prohibit the U.S. Government from purchasing technology manufactured in Communist China.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Communist China is STEALING our technology and intellectual property, yet the U.S. Government continues to buy critical technology, like drones and communications equipment, with American tax dollars from Chinese companies backed by their government. For far too long, we have turned a blind eye to Communist China and allowed their technology into some of the most critical operations of the U.S. Government. We have to get serious about this, and I&#8217;m working to make sure American national security comes first.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and James Lankford Introduce TIPS Act to Address FBI Failures  Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and James Lankford introduced the Threat Information Protocol for Sharing (TIPS) Act to hold the FBI accountable for its failures to address critical deficiencies in its handling of actionable intelligence on the perpetrators of mass violence. This legislation is supported by Stand with Parkland, an organization founded by the family members of the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t think about the 17 souls that were taken from us in a brutal act of violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Following the tragedy, we all worked together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act to make our schools safer and prevent future tragedies, but we aren&#8217;t finished. We cannot accept the repeated failures of the FBI to properly investigate and act on specific tips received about the Parkland shooter, as well as other perpetrators of mass violence in Florida. I&#8217;m proud to introduce the TIPS Act, which bridges the gap between federal and state law enforcement agencies by mandating information sharing of all state-specific criminal intelligence tips. This is about getting information on threats into the hands of the right people, who can ultimately prevent violence and protect our families.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Jim Inhofe and Colleagues Introduce Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Jim Inhofe and colleagues to introduce the Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act, which would prohibit abortion based on an unborn child having Down syndrome.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Every child is born with dignity and deserves to be welcomed into the world. As a father and a grandfather, I am proud to fight for every life, and I hope all of my colleagues join me in protecting the most vulnerable among us.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Inhofe's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Interior Department&#8217;s Decision to Protect National Security and Ground Drones Made in Communist China  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the Department of the Interior&#8217;s decision to ground its fleet of Chinese drones amid concerns of foreign surveillance. Last month, Senator Scott introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.  Senator Rick Scott said,&nbsp;&#8220;Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, I&#8217;m glad to see the Department has seen the light and reversed course. We should not, under any circumstances, put American national security at risk by using taxpayer dollars to purchase Chinese tech. We must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants. We need to completely reassess our posture towards Communist China, and passing my bill is a good start.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and John Cornyn Introduce Legislation Condemning Communist China&#8217;s Human Rights Violations   Senators Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and John Cornyn introduced the&nbsp;Hong Kong Be Water&nbsp;Act condemning Communist China&#8217;s violation of human rights in Hong Kong. The legislation also calls for sanctions against the Hong Kong authorities and Communist Chinese government officials who are denying human rights to the people of Hong Kong under orders from President Xi.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;During my trip to Hong Kong earlier this month, I met with protesters who are fighting to regain the freedom they were promised by Communist China. I heard horrible stories of police brutality, threats, and intimidation. As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue. I&#8217;m proud to sponsor the Hong Kong Be Water Act as we stand with the brave Hong Kongers fighting for freedom and basic human rights that are being suppressed by Communist China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott on Senate Floor: Let&#8217;s Work Together to Lower the Cost of Healthcare for Americans  Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate Floor about the Democrats&#8217; latest attempt to prevent states from having any flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens. Senator Scott is working on real solutions to lower the cost of healthcare for Americans.   Read excerpts of Senator Scott&#8217;s remarks as prepared for delivery below or his full speech HERE.  What we&#8217;ve heard this week from my Democrat colleagues on healthcare is just more of the same. More fear-mongering, more misinformation.&nbsp;  The issue this week is what&#8217;s called 1332 Waivers.&nbsp;  These waivers allow states flexibility in how they implement healthcare programs.&nbsp;  It&#8217;s a simple concept. Every state is different. Every state should have the flexibility to design their healthcare programs and regulations in a way that best fits the needs of their citizens.&#133;  But here&#8217;s the problem&#133;the Democrats don&#8217;t believe in state&#8217;s rights, or allowing state taxpayers and citizens ANY flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens.  The Democrats want these top-down, one-size-fits-all federal programs. If there is choice and flexibility, they want to restrict it. It&#8217;s how big government works, and the Democrats love big government, restrictive mandates, and socialism.&#133;  We need to reduce healthcare costs and provide a safety net for those who cannot afford their healthcare, not create a federal government-organized healthcare market, which causes healthcare costs to skyrocket.  Giving flexibility to the states is an easy way to increase access and quality of care for the American people.&#133;  Enough with the misrepresentations. Enough with the nonsense. Enough with the fear mongering. The American people deserve better.&nbsp;  Let&#8217;s work together to lower the costs of healthcare, so all taxpayers can get the care they need at a price they can afford.&nbsp;&nbsp;              Sen. Rick Scott: We Need to Fight for the Values that Made America Great  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner to share his personal story and priorities as a United States Senator.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;&#133; Even though my Mom had no money, she was optimistic and hopeful. She told us we were blessed because God and our founders created the greatest country ever, where anything was possible.&#133;  While I didn&#8217;t always appreciate my tough-love, my-way-or-the-highway Mom growing up, I now thank God every day for my Mom and this country. She gave me the opportunity to experience every lesson this country had to offer before I was 20.  Unfortunately, the left has worked hard over the last 50 years to discredit the values of the America I was raised with and the values of the America I want my grandsons to grow up with. We all acknowledge that Americans, our country, and our institutions have flaws, but the left has worked to discredit our founders, our institutions, our churches, our law enforcement, our morals, and almost everything my mom taught me.&#133;&nbsp;  The values that I grew up with, the ones my tough-love mom taught me, are becoming a way of the past. But I believe these values, these virtues, can and should be part of our country&#8217;s future.&#133;  In the meantime, let's fight for the country I was raised in because that is the country our children and grandchildren deserve.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.  &#151;  Florida Daily:   Fox Business:   Fox News:   Bloomberg:   The Hill:  Florida Daily:  Florida Daily:  Bloomberg:   Florida Daily:   Florida Daily:   Acci&#243;n 97.9:   El Nacional:               As the best state in the nation to live, work and raise a family, it's no wonder everyone wants to move to Florida.

Americans pay the highest per capita costs for healthcare, but our health outcomes don&#8217;t reflect that. We need to fix that, and we can start by motivating people towards healthier lifestyles. In mid-October, I held a discussion on prevention in Bangor with local healthcare providers and public wellness experts on the best ways to use prevention strategies to improve health outcomes and reduce costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cheapest medical procedure is the one that doesn&#8217;t need to happen &#150; we should figure out ways to prevent issues before they get serious.&nbsp;The voices at our event in Bangor had important ideas on how to find solutions that will improve both our health and our wallets, and I'm bringing their insights back to Washington as I push to make prevention a healthcare priority.   &nbsp;  Scenes from Maine   University of Maine Unveils the World's Largest 3D Printer   Maine made history on October 10, 2019 by unveiling the world's largest 3D printer and largest 3D printed object: a boat!&nbsp;  The event marks the latest innovative investment in Maine&#8217;s forest economy, which will serve to increase sustainability, advance the future of bio-based manufacturing, and diversify our forest products industry. It's a huge opportunity for the state of Maine, limited only by our imaginations. I&#8217;m grateful to everyone involved &#151; especially the University of Maine and the FOR/Maine initiative &#151; for their work to make this day a reality.    &nbsp;   22nd Annual Togus Stand Down for Homeless Veterans   Maine&#8217;s veterans have made immense sacrifices to ensure our national security and they&#8217;ve earned our unwavering support &#150; that&#8217;s why events like the Annual Stand Down at Togus VA Medical Center are so important.&nbsp;  The 22nd Annual Stand Down represents an all hands-on-deck approach to veteran care so these men and women can face these challenges head on and lead happy, healthy lives.    It&#8217;s up to us to ensure that these heroes have the resources and means to improve their quality of life and build a path forward. By bringing together organizations that support veterans struggling with homelessness, substance use disorders, and mental health complications, we can connect those in need with those who can help.&nbsp;   Touring Aroostook County   At the&nbsp;Aroostook Area Agency on Aging, I spoke with folks about Medicare, drug prices and more. These are kind people who are working to make their communities better places to live for Maine seniors. They are making a real difference &#151; I&#8217;m grateful for their work.   The Aroostook County Action Program helps residents get back on their feet in the face of homelessness, addiction, unemployment and more. They are a support system in every sense of the phrase &#150; so impressed by them and their work, which is vital for the county.    During my Aroostook community visits, I was excited to see the innovations underway at the University of Maine at Presque Isle.&nbsp;From agricultural facilities to a new cybersecurity program, they&#8217;re investing to help get students ready for the 21st century workforce; these efforts will benefit the County, state, and country in years ahead.   &nbsp;   Ribbon Cutting Ceremony of World's First Agriculture Focused Credit Union   Maine&#8217;s farmers and food businesses make vital contributions to our state, which is why it is so important that they have the tools they need to succeed.  This event marked a milestone for farmers &#150; the nation&#8217;s first credit union uniquely focused on serving the agricultural community! The Maine Harvest Federal Credit Union will combine the community-focused approach of credit unions with agricultural expertise, allowing our farmers to access specialized support that will help them thrive. This opportunity, will open new doors for Maine farmers &#151; I&#8217;m thrilled to see what comes next.  &nbsp;  Thoughts from Senator King Congress Must Follow the Facts in Impeachment Inquiry  This column appeared in the Portland Press Herald&nbsp;and the Bangor Daily News&nbsp;on October 8th, 2019  &nbsp;  We are in the midst of a difficult and dangerous period. Over the past two years, I have been a conservative on impeachment; one of my heroes is&nbsp;William Pitt Fessenden,&nbsp;a Maine senator just after the Civil War who cast one of the deciding votes against the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. (This vote, which threatened to end Fessenden&#8217;s political career, was featured in John F. Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;Profiles in Courage.&#8221;) He believed then (as I do now) that overturning the results of an election should be an absolute last resort and should not be based upon policy or political differences between the Congress and the president.  But when a sitting president admits to using the power of his office to openly solicit the engagement of a foreign government in his re-election campaign (President Zelensky &#150; &#8220;We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins [anti-tank missiles] from the United States for defense purposes.&#8221; President Trump &#150; &#8220;I would like you to do us a favor though&#133;&#8221;), it&#8217;s hard to argue that beginning a formal process to get all the facts is unjustified. &nbsp; Just in the first week of the House inquiry, more disturbing facts &#150; and new questions &#150; have arisen. Texts between administration officials suggest the possibility of a pretty explicit quid pro quo, in fact several. Investigation of Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid, for a call with the president, or for a visit to the White House. Additionally, the role of the president&#8217;s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr must be examined and clarified. And finally, the president&#8217;s extraordinary public statement requesting that China investigate the Bidens. Such a request to a foreign country with regard to any American citizen would be unusual, but when that American citizen happens to be the son of one of the president&#8217;s potential political opponents, the request is less about policy than the personal political interests of the president.  In fact, this entire matter seems to rest upon this president&#8217;s inability to distinguish between the national interest and his own personal interest. Only this can explain his continuous characterization of the Zelensky call as &#8220;perfect,&#8221; in spite of his repeated requests that Ukraine investigate his political rival as shown in the White House-released summary of the call. This also explains his frequent misuse of the word &#8220;treason,&#8221; which is defined (in the Constitution itself) as &#8220;only in levying war against them (the United States), or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.&#8221; Criticism of the president, even strong criticism of the president, or a whistleblower reporting possible wrongdoing by the president, is not treason, it is democracy.  Our entire constitutional system is built upon the principle of checks and balances, expressing in concrete terms the Framers&#8217; deep concern about the grave dangers of power concentrated in one set of hands. The separation of powers, fixed terms of office, vetoes, Senate confirmation of Cabinet and judges, ratification of treaties, the power to declare war and others are all there to ensure that power is shared and that, ultimately, we are protected from those who might abuse the power lent to them by the people. And so it is with impeachment, the ultimate check on a public official&#8217;s betrayal of their trust.  As a potential juror in an impeachment trial, I will make my final decision only after weighing the facts and evidence established by the process now underway in the House. Although I believe that this process may well be politically advantageous to the president, it seems to me that those of us who took an oath to &#8220;support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic &#133;&#8221; at this point have no choice but to follow the facts, wherever they may lead. This is a solemn and historic moment, and it cannot be avoided. As usual, Abraham Lincoln captured the essence of times like these, &#8220;Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We, of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.&#8221; &nbsp;   Legislative Update&nbsp;    Pushed to secure American elections from foreign influence.

He inspired not only those in Detroit, but also directly impacted countless Americans across the country. There would never be enough time in the world to fully encapsulate what he meant to me and the people of Michigan&#8217;s Thirteenth Congressional District, but please watch my full address in honor of his tremendous legacy and know that it is that tremendous legacy that fuels my work on your behalf every single day.     My sincere condolences go out to his family, friends, and loved ones. May Congressman Conyers rest in peace as we continue his fight for jobs, justice, and peace. I will be attending the homegoing service for Congressman Conyers on Monday,&nbsp;November 4th at 11 a.m. at Greater Grace Temple (23500 West Seven Mile Road, Detroit, Michigan 48219).
