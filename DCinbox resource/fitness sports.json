[{"name":"Congressman Greg Murphy M.D.","address":"gregory.murphy@congressnewsletter.net","timestamp":"2020-02-14","subject":"From Congressman Murphy's Desk","body":"Latest News Impeachment is finally over After more than four long, divisive and counter-productive months, impeachment is finally over and the president has been rightfully acquittedthe actions of the president did not warrant the charges. Congress has been stuck at a standstill for too long. Having been sworn into Congress only a week prior to the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, I am thankful this storm has passed and I can finally begin the legislative work eastern North Carolinians elected me to do. Congress could and should have been working on issues like healthcare, prescription drugs, border security and more instead of this tiresome and illegitimate impeachment. Hopefully, we can finally get back to tending to the business of the people. Unfortunately, I doubt that will be the case after the petty and partisan theatrics displayed by Speaker Pelosi at the State of the Union address. Bipartisan efforts that would benefit the American people will likely be forgone due to the Speakers disdain for the president and her fear of giving him legislative victories. America deserves better. What's going on with coronavirus? As a physician and member of Congress, I wanted to give you all an update on the status of the coronavirus and how the United States is working to combat its spread. Watch the video below to learn more. Surprise billing There is bipartisan agreement that surprise billing is a major problem for patients and families across America. It desperately needs to be addressed. While Im glad we discussed the best path forward to alleviate the problems of surprise billing during a markup of H.R. 5800 in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week, this legislation is not the right solution to this problem. Even though I couldn't support H.R. 5800 in its entirety, I was glad to improve it with two amendments that were adopted unanimously. As a physician, I'll continue to utilize my expertise on these issues to lower the cost of healthcare and increase patient access to provide Americans with the greatest treatments possible. Watch my opening statement below: Veterans HOPE Act Last week, I was proud to introduce the Veterans HOPE Act to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans. Between 2010 and 2016, deaths due to opioid overdose rose by 65% among veterans. During those same years, veteran deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by roughly five-fold. Meanwhile, the rate of prescription opioid receipts within three months before death declined by more than 25%, suggesting that opioid overdoses are likely stemming from hard or synthetic drugs, without knowledge of the initial prescriber. To combat this issue, the Veterans HOPE Act would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to further investigate deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids. Upon conclusion of the study, the Secretary would report findings to the public and Congress and suggest veteran overdose prevention efforts to save lives. As a member of the North Carolina State Assembly, authoring the main legislative actions to combat the opioid crisis in North Carolina was one of my proudest achievements. Now as the U.S. Representative of a Congressional District with the fifth most veterans in America, the Veterans HOPE Act is especially important research to me. The data speaks for itselfveteran deaths caused by non-prescribed opioids like heroin and fentanyl have skyrocketed. But our veterans are more than a statistic. They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers who have selflessly sacrificed so much for our great nation. It is our duty to do all we can to protect them from the dangers of opioid addiction. You can read the bill here. District Highlights George Henry White Commemorative Stamp Act Honored to introduce legislation this week alongside several of my North Carolina colleagues to honor George Henry White of New Bern, a Republican politican and the last black member of Congress during Reconstruction. George Henry White courageously stood up to racial injustice in a hostile time period for African Americans, especially in the South. The cause of Civil Rights in this country was only advanced because of strong and brave leaders like him. It was only fitting that we honor such a historic African American figure during Black History Month. You can read more about his life and legacy here. Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office Almost one year after Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.'s passing, Im pleased that a bill I introduced in his honor advanced through the House of Representatives. This measure would designate a post office in his hometown of Farmville, the \"Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office.\" It was altogether fitting that my first piece of legislation as a member of Congress be a tribute to my predecessor, friend and mentor. Walter cared deeply for the people of eastern North Carolina, especially the Marines who serve at Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point and New River. He epitomized what a public servant stood forhis constituents. I greatly appreciate my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation for unanimously supporting this bill, and I hope the Senate and President Trump will swiftly act to make this bill a law. You can watch my remarks from the House floor in support of the bill below: Christina Koch Returns to Earth Congratulations to Christina Koch for completing her 328 day mission in space! Welcome back to planet Earth! Christina grew up in Jacksonville and attended NC State. Her time aboard the International Space Station set the record for the longest single continuous spaceflight by a female. Such a tremendous accomplishment for North Carolina, the United States of America and all of humanity. Welcome home, Christina! You can read more about her record-breaking flight here. District Work Even though I've been in our nation's capital for the past two weeks, I've met with numerous people and organizations from North Carolina, many of whom are from the Third District. Scroll through the photos below to see some of the people I met. Had a productive discussion about how Congress can impact state and local narcotic issues with Sgt. Kevin Black, Lt. Daniel Duckworth, Sgt. Mike Dawson, Special Agent Joe Barringer and Sgt. Jason Chappell. Enjoyed talking with representatives from the Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource Council. Forestry is such a vital part of the economy in eastern North Carolina. These gentlemen work at International Paper's facility in New Bern. I learned a great deal about this wonderful renewable resource. It was an honor meeting UNC Chapel Hill's Athletic Director, Bubba Cunningham, and other senior athletic department officials. We talked about college athletics and issues relating to student-athlete compensation that are affecting the NCAA. Met with Tom Gentile, President and CEO of Spirit AeroSystems to discuss their business and presence in North Carolina. Such an honor to attend the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit with President Trump and several of my colleagues from the North Carolina Congressional delegation. Cutting taxes and red tape has helped create jobs and raise wages across every demographic. We have helped stressed areas of our country by raising people out of poverty with jobs and pride. So much better than creating more government dependency. I will continue to support this administration and its pro-growth policies while serving the great people of eastern North Carolina. It was great meeting with Winston Salem Special Olympics athlete, Jennifer Wardlow, and President and CEO of Special Olympics North Carolina, Keith Fishburne. The Special Olympics is a truly fantastic organization. Honored to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, with several of my colleagues from the North Carolina delegation. Agriculture is extremely important in eastern North Carolina, and recent trade victories like USMCA and the Phase One trade agreement with China are big wins for American farmers. As a physician, I always enjoy discussing how we can improve America's healthcare system. Had a productive discussion with representatives from National Rural Health. Access, equity and quality of healthcare are especially important issues in places like eastern North Carolina. Thanks for reading! Thank you for signing up to receive my newsletter.

Morgan Griffith","address":"Griffith.News@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-14","subject":"No Road Back for the ERA","body":"No Road Back for the ERA There are few things from 1972 that you could just pick up and dust off for use today. Clothes would be out of fashion if they even fit, cars would need plenty of maintenance and care to be driven, and disco music had not even made its way onto the music charts. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) passed Congress in that year! It proposes a solution to a problem that existed prior to 1972 and was being resolved with good legislation at the federal and state levels. For an amendment to pass, the United States Constitution requires the approval of two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, followed by ratification in three-fourths of the states. It is not supposed to be an easy process, and only 27 amendments have been added since the Constitutions adoption. The ERA included a seven-year deadline for ratification. By the time it arrived in 1979, 31 states had ratified the ERA. Four others had ratified it but rescinded their ratifications by the deadline. By no measure had the required 38 states ratified the ERA. Congress then passed an extension to 1982, although the extension only passed by a simple majority rather than the two-thirds vote required for constitutional amendments, rendering the extension legally very suspect. A federal district court in Idaho found the extension invalid in 1981. In any event, no more states ratified the ERA by the 1982 deadline. The Supreme Court that year declared a lawsuit about the extension moot because the amendment had failed. The House of Representatives in 1983 tried to pass a new Equal Rights Amendment, another concession that the ratification process begun in 1972 was dead, but that new ERA did not attain the required two-thirds vote. You dont have to go back almost four decades to find Supreme Court justices who think the ERA is dead. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ERA supporter, said on February 10, 2020, Id like it to start over, noting the controversy with states adopting it late and others rescinding it before ratification. Nevertheless, supporters of the ERA are plowing ahead. Virginias new Democrat majority in the General Assembly spent valuable legislative time on ratification, and the Democrat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution by simple majority to remove the deadline. ERA proponents cite the 27th Amendment, which prohibited congressional pay raises from taking effect before an election of representatives had intervened. This amendment was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights in 1789 and only ratified in 1992, but unlike the ERA, it never had a deadline. Other amendments, such as the Eighteenth Amendment imposing Prohibition, did include a deadline but were ratified in time. In light of these facts, the recent activity regarding the ERA is little more than a sideshow. But what of Justice Ginsburgs suggestion that supporters of the amendment start over? The country is in a different place than it was in 1972, when the ERA passed Congress. It is certainly in a different place than it was in 1943, when the text was first introduced, or 1923, when the original ERA was proposed. I am sympathetic to those who advocated the amendment prior to 1972. In the 1960s, my mother sought a loan for our house on Broad Street in Salem. The house I grew up in was at risk of being lost. At the time, she was ineligible because she was a divorced woman. A divorced man earning the same would have had no problem. That was wrong. Fortunately, a sympathetic loan officer checked the box that she was widowed, thus making her eligible. By the 1970s, when she applied for a loan for a house on Main Street, that legal barrier had been eliminated by good legislation without the need for a constitutional amendment. In just a few years, the situation had changed and my mother was treated more fairly. ERA supporters overlook our ability to make progress, whether by specific legal changes, cultural shifts, or other means apart from the drastic step of amending the Constitution. Any injustices that exist today should be remedied by legislation. The ERA is a blunt instrument. Its very broadness could lead to applications that are far from promoting equality. For instance, some states that have included ERAs in their constitutions have been forced to support abortion. Courts could very well force the same outcome at the federal level. Legally, the ERA has been long dead, and it should not be resurrected. If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.

During a Senate Finance Committee hearing this week, I pressed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on the impact that the Administration&#8217;s proposed cuts to Medicaid would have on Granite Staters.  During the hearing, I highlighted the story of Ashley Raymond from Enfield, New Hampshire, who started using opioids at the age of 14, and was unable to access treatment until getting coverage through Medicaid. I met Ashley last year when I visited Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center&#8217;s Moms in Recovery program for pregnant or parenting moms grappling with substance use disorder, where Ashley is a client. Without Medicaid, she would be unable to afford her treatment, or her prescription medication.  According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, these proposed cuts would cause states to start the process of ending their Medicaid expansion programs, which would put 17 million Americans at risk of losing coverage, including 57,000 people in New Hampshire.  The President&#8217;s proposed budget would also eliminate funding for the Northern Border Regional Commission, which provides critical grants to combat the opioid epidemic, strengthen aging infrastructure, and promote workforce development. In addition, the President&#8217;s budget would make deep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health while we are in the midst of battling the coronavirus public health emergency.  I will work with members of both parties to reject this harmful budget proposal and support a fiscally responsible budget that supports the health and well-being of all of our people, expands economic opportunity, and strengthens our national security. With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On Following briefings from current and former Administration officials on the government&#8217;s response to the coronavirus public health emergency, Senator Hassan called on the Trump Administration to increase funding and improve its coordination efforts to contain this outbreak.

This legislation addresses growing student loan debt by making the student loan interest tax deduction work better for married couples. Current law penalizes married couples by only allowing them to take one deduction&#8212;even if both spouses qualify. This bill would stop this unfair tax on student loans against married couples while also helping individuals with their student loan debt burden. For decades, hardworking Americans have been saddled with student loan debt which has delayed their dreams of achieving financial stability. I am proud to lead this effort to maximize the student loan interest tax deduction that married couples can claim each tax year. This allows married couples to put more towards paying off their student loans, incur less interest, put more food on the table, or save a little more for a down payment on a home. This unfair marriage penalty came to my attention after Claudia McHale, a constituent from Garden City, discussed with me the situation of her niece and her husband. Both of them paid towards reducing their student loan yet were only able to claim a $2,500 deduction between the two of them, the same maximum amount a single individual can claim every tax year. As Claudia said, &#8220;it is ridiculous that the federal government punishes taxpayers with student loan balances just because they get married.&#8221;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; __________  On Tuesday, I received the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council. This recognition is awarded to Members of Congress with a proven record of defending the right to life, religious freedoms, and family values.   It is truly an honor to represent Missouri's 4th congressional district as we fight for our foundational values.  Legislative Update On Thursday, Democrat leadership in the House attempted resurrect the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) through Congress.  I commend the women who have gone before us, to celebrate the achievements women have made, and to reaffirm the fact that we are already equal in the eyes of God and in law. Women make up 51% of the population, comprise over half of college students, make up most of today&#8217;s medical and law school students, and own the majority of new businesses. Little girls can be whatever they want to be whether that be an astronaut, a doctor, a full-time mom working at home, or a Member of Congress.  In addition, federal law and court precedent uphold our rights. That is something to applaud and I do.  However, today&#8217;s legislation is problematic on several fronts. First, the resolution is unconstitutional. The time limit to pass the ERA expired decades ago. Congress can&#8217;t go back and remove a deadline from a previous constitutional amendment initiative. The Supreme Court has recognized that the 1972 ERA expired, and the Department of Justice issued a ruling saying, &#8220;Congress may not revive a proposed amendment after a deadline for its ratification has expired.&#8221; Pretending we can remove the time limits for passage is both futile and deceptive. Secondly, if the time limit COULD be extended, the ERA would not bring women any more rights than they currently have but it would entrench the legality of abortion. We know this from court precedent and by listening to those who have the most to gain from constitutionally protecting abortion on demand.  In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Rights Amendment in their state constitution requires state-funding of abortions. Federal courts are likely to do the same. Perhaps this is why every major pro-abortion organization is endorsing passage of the ERA.  NARAL Pro-Choice America says: &#8220;With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion&#8230;.&#8221; National Organization for Women: &#8220;An ERA&#8212;properly interpreted&#8212;could negate the hundreds of laws that have been passed restricting access to abortion care.&#8230;&#8221; But that&#8217;s not the only concern with passing this resolution. Besides being unconstitutional and shredding state and federal pro-life protections, the ERA would also erase decades of progress which have provided opportunities for women, advanced women&#8217;s progress through federal programs, and secured necessary protections for women and girls. How? By incorporating gender identity in the definition of &#8216;sex&#8217;, jeopardizing private spaces for women, girls&#8217; sports programs, and women&#8217;s educational institutions.  By banning distinctions between men and women, the ERA also endangers laws, programs and funding designed to benefit women. The ERA provides a pathway for legal challenges to welfare programs, grants for battered women&#8217;s shelters, efforts to bolster women participating in STEM programs. These outcomes of the ERA are anything but pro-woman. I urge my colleagues to vote &#8216;No&#8217; on today&#8217;s resolution and uphold the Constitution, promote life, and protect women&#8217;s rights that have been so hard-fought gained.  District Update I am so pleased to tell you about an honor recently won by Columbia Public Schools. Project Tomorrow is a national education nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that&nbsp;today&#8217;s students are well prepared to be tomorrow&#8217;s innovators, leaders, and engaged citizens of the world. Project Tomorrow is recognizing Columbia Public Schools with its annual Speak Up District of Honor award, an honor given to school districts for leadership and commitment to listening to the voices and views of students, parents, and educators.    I believe it is through these valuable exchanges that better learning experiences are created for students from kindergarten through the 12th grade. Congratulations to Columbia Public Schools for earning this distinction and for its dedication to improving and enhancing the educational experience for its students.  Constituent Update I want to share with you that our office has joined forces with the Library of Congress to help preserve, forever, the stories of our veterans.   The Veterans History Project began as an effort to collect the accounts of America&#8217;s World War II heroes, many of whom are passing away without their stories being saved for posterity. It has since expanded to veterans of all military encounters with the goal of ensuring their personal memories are recorded and made available for future generations. If you are a veteran or if you know a veteran who would like to share your experiences as part of the Veterans History Project, contact Steve Walsh in our Columbia office at 573-442-9311.

This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year. This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model. It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference. In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area. I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our country&#8217;s food and agriculture interests. Read more here,&nbsp;  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products. The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.&nbsp;I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient. This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.&nbsp;For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products. Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store. Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as &#8220;milk&#8221;. I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law.

This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game. NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!  Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce.&nbsp;   It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing. In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease. I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases. I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.   I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards. I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress. Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events. The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees. This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires. Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance. This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base.

Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving on&#8239;our embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts. This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted. As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical. Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders. Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots. We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and I&#8217;m honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress. Read more here.  Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown. The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities.&nbsp; Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns. Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities. I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.

The op-ed was published in&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;this week. Read it here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!

Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for \"absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies\" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases. Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines &#8211; though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks.  \"New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,\" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

I am proud to announce that I have secured significant funding to start construction on the Arkansas Valley Conduit, which will provide clean drinking water for 50,000 Coloradans in 40 communities. This is&nbsp;the first time funding has been secured since Congress authorized the project and President Kennedy promised completion nearly six decades ago. The communities of the Lower Arkansas Valley deserve clean drinking water, which the Arkansas Valley Conduit will supply for generations to come. This is the first time robust federal funding of $28 million has been dedicated to the project which will help finish final design, pre-construction costs, and begin construction to get to the first community in need.&nbsp;In Pueblo last week I celebrated the good news with members of the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District and discussed the next steps on the project.&nbsp;Read more from the&nbsp;Pueblo Chieftain.  Learn More About My Guest to the&nbsp;State of the Union Address   Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;or the picture above to watch&nbsp;remarks from Senator Gardner and his State of the Union guest Kristen Christy on destigmatizing mental health.  I&#8217;m honored that&nbsp;Kristen Christy, the 2018 Air Force Spouse of the Year, attended the State of the Union Address as my guest.&nbsp;Kristen has experienced heartbreaking loss that no family should ever have to face. Through her strength and commitment to military families,&nbsp;Kristen has become an inspiring suicide prevention advocate and guiding light for the Air Force and entire military community as she helps others transition from post-traumatic stress to post-traumatic growth. Her resilience, courage, and her never-quit attitude exemplify the best of the American spirit, and it&#8217;s fitting that someone with her inspirational and moving story was in the room as the president highlighted the progress and opportunities for our great country. Meeting with&nbsp;Fort Carson&nbsp;Officials About Infrastructure Improvements and the Novel Coronavirus  I recently visited Fort Carson and&nbsp;received an update on Gate 19 construction and infrastructure improvement projects both on base and in the community. We also discussed the possibility of evacuees from the novel&nbsp;coronavirus outbreak being quarantined at Fort Carson. I appreciate the leadership on base that is organized and ready if needed to assist our nation's response and containment of this virus. I wrote to leaders on the Senate Appropriations Committee requesting that they work with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to&nbsp;ensure robust funding to respond to the novel coronavirus outbreak. As the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;coronavirus continues to spread&nbsp;around the world, HHS, through a number of its agencies, is actively leading critical prevention, containment, and supply chain stability efforts.&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;must serve as a collaborative partner and ensure&nbsp;that there is sufficient funding for both current and potential future efforts to&nbsp;contain this communicable and deadly virus. Meeting with the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce  I recently&nbsp;had a great discussion with the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce Legislative Affairs Committee on water policy, transportation and housing issues, and ways we can work together to grow the economy and boost job creation in Colorado.&nbsp;I always&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;with Coloradans&nbsp;to&nbsp;gain their input on a variety of issues and help&nbsp;bring more of Colorado to Washington.&nbsp; New Renovations at the&nbsp;Colorado Springs Airport  &nbsp; I had a great visit at the Colorado Springs Airport to discuss renovations and growth, including&nbsp;plans for a new airtanker base and ramp&nbsp;to support firefighting efforts. Year after year, much of the West is forced to deal with horrible wildfires that burn millions of acres. Our firefighters risk everything to protect our communities and it's our duty to make sure they have every possible tool to safely fight wildfires. This&nbsp;new&nbsp;airtanker base will serve as an incredible resource for firefighters in Colorado and surrounding areas. Providing&nbsp;Student Loan Relief&nbsp;for&nbsp;Colorado&nbsp;Students In November, the Department of Education announced it would cancel the loans taken out by students to attend the Art Institute of Colorado between January 20, 2018&nbsp;&#8211; when the school lost its accreditation&nbsp;&#8211; and December 31, 2018 &#8211; when they shut their doors.&nbsp;Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) and I urged&nbsp;Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to extend the school discharge eligibility period because the relief is incomplete and does not relieve students of the debt they took on to attend the school prior to January 20, 2018, which is now worthless.&nbsp;At our&nbsp;urging, the Department of Education agreed to expand student loan forgiveness&nbsp;for those who attended the Art Institute of Colorado at the time the school lost its accreditation, meaning more Colorado students will receive full relief on federal loans still owed, as well as a refund of loans they have already paid.  Supporting&nbsp;Sugar Beet Farmers&nbsp;After&nbsp;Adverse Weather Conditions The past two years have been devastating for Cooperative farmers working in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, and Wyoming due to significant weather events. In 2018 and 2019, growing regions across these states experienced freezing temperatures in early October before sugar beets are typically harvested.&nbsp;I sent a bipartisan letter with Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) and a bipartisan group of our colleagues&nbsp;urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to take immediate action&nbsp;in implementing the sugar beet eligibility provisions that were passed in the Fiscal Year 2020 Appropriations bill as part of the Wildfire, Hurricane, and Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+). This program has been essential for farmers during adverse weather growing seasons,&nbsp;and USDA&#8217;s swift action is necessary in order for farmers to obtain operating loans for the 2020 crop.  Meeting Taiwan&#8217;s&nbsp;Vice President-Elect Lai Ching-te  I was honored to meet with Taiwan&#8217;s Vice President-elect Lai Ching-te recently&nbsp;and reaffirm that the U.S.&nbsp;Congress will continue to advocate on behalf of Taiwan as guided by U.S.&nbsp;law, including the Taiwan Relations Act, the Taiwan Travel Act, and my&nbsp;Asia Reassurance Initiative Act. I also relayed my concerns with the World Health Organization excluding Taiwan as the&nbsp;novel&nbsp;coronavirus spreads around the globe. As China continues its aggressive campaign to delegitimize Taiwan, it&#8217;s critically important for the U.S.&nbsp;to reaffirm our support for Taiwan.

I am proud of these results, particularly as it relates to our thriving economy and how it is working to the benefit all Americans. I was disheartened by the behavior of some of my colleagues, which I found to be a stain on the rich history of our institution and a poor example for our children. What unites us as Americans is greater than our division and we must work together in a civil manner to find common ground.  Additionally, last week the Senate finally brought to a close a partisan, politically-motivated charade. There are many important issues facing our country, and the time for putting this distraction behind us is long overdue. I will continue to work with my colleagues to build consensus on the issues that matter most to our community and that will improve the lives of those I serve.  Strengthening our Economy  Last week&#8217;s State of the Union address highlighted our great economic success story.&nbsp; Here are just a few examples in Florida.  The most recent Jobs Report contains more good news about the strength of the American economy. More than 225,000 jobs were added in January and the jobless rate was 3.6%. Additionally, wages are up 3.1% when compared to last January. For the past 18 consecutive months, average pay has grown at an annual pace of 3% or higher. We must continue to support pro-growth policies.&nbsp; Last week, I voted against the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act because it is exactly the kind of legislation that would cripple our economy. While it may sound well intentioned, its impact would be devastating. We currently have a record low unemployment rate because we have created a climate that allows small businesses to thrive. Small businesses are the backbone of our nation&#8217;s economy. When they are free to innovate and compete in the free market, jobs are created and wages rise.  Additionally, it was an honor to be recognized last week by the U.S. Travel Association for my work to reauthorize the Brand USA program. This public-private partnership has a solid record of attracting international tourists to the U.S. without costing the taxpayers a dime. Given that tourism is so important to the state of Florida's economy, passage of my bill was a priority.   Fighting for our Heroes  I'm continuing to work in a bipartisan manner to improve Veterans' access to benefits and ensure resources are used as efficiently as possible in order to meet the needs of our nation's heroes. This article outlines a bill I co-authored last week to help accomplish this goal.&nbsp;  In last week&#8217;s VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Hearing we discussed a variety of draft bills to help improve educational opportunities for Veterans. Click here to listen to my remarks during the hearing.&nbsp;  Last week, a bill I cosponsored passed the House. The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act creates a pilot program within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help combat Veterans address mental health issues by pairing them with dogs to train as service animals. The bill directs the VA to provide grants to nonprofits that teach Veterans to train service dogs. Upon completion of the program, Veterans can, if they wish, adopt their dogs for ongoing therapy. This is one small part of the work I&#8217;ve been doing to help Veterans gain access to alternative and complementary therapies. One size does not fit all when it comes to an issue as sensitive as addressing the mental health needs of our nation&#8217;s heroes and they deserve access to every type of treatment that has proven effective.   Additionally, several constituents have called my office recently asking for an update on the Zephyrhills VA Clinic. I received the following update from the VA Leadership Team:  \"The design phase took longer than anticipated due to strict VA guidelines for clinic construction, but the builder was able to make up some time and we are on track for clinic construction completion by the end of 2020 and full clinic activation in fall 2021.&#8221;  Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs  I was glad to hear the President call for bipartisan solutions for lowering prescription drug prices, something that has been a priority for me. HR 19 has over 40 provisions that have widespread bipartisan support. Let&#8217;s bring that bill to the Floor immediately.&nbsp;  Protecting Public Health   Fentanyl analogues are extremely dangerous and have been proven to be deadly for many Americans. While the Speaker waited until the deadline to extend this critical ban, I am glad the President was finally able to sign legislation that maintains the strictest safeguards to protect against abuse of this highly potent narcotic.   The current outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has dominated news headlines.&nbsp; As I mentioned last week, it is important to remain calm.&nbsp; The virus originated in China but has now spread internationally, impacting an increasing number of countries. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is taking the necessary precautions to protect the American public. However, the CDC always recommends everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including the following tips:   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. &nbsp; Visit the CDC website to learn more about prevention strategies.  Improving Transparency  We have been calling on FEMA to approve the updated flood maps for several years. I&#8217;m glad to see they will be implemented in just a few months because homeowners deserve an accurate and transparent process.&nbsp;  Praying for the Future of Our Nation  It was an honor to attend last week's National Prayer Breakfast. My prayer is that the leaders of our great nation will come together in unity to solve the problems that impact the daily lives of those we serve. I ask God to give leaders at all levels the humility, strength and grace to rise above division and prioritize the needs of our citizens.   Raising Awareness  Black History month allows us the opportunity to celebrate all of the unique contributions that African Americans have made to strengthen our nation.  February is also American Heart Month, a perfect time to learn how to prevent heart disease and keep #OurHearts healthy. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women, but is largely preventable. The most common type of heart disease affects 1,441,000 people in Florida. Click here to learn what you can do to protect your heart.&nbsp; Constituent Corner  Last week I received a call from a constituent in Holiday who thanked me for helping her father solve a problem with incorrect Social Security payments. They had been working with the Social Security Administration for more than 5 months. After calling my office, his problem was resolved within one week.  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  During last week's economic development meeting hosted by the North Tampa Bay Chamber, my team received an update from the Department of Transportation on current and anticipated transportation projects. Increased congestion is a major concern for all us who call the Tampa Bay area home. It is important that we continue to tackle the problem and develop solutions on a regional basis.    Last weekend, my team had the chance to speak to the Pasco County Housing Authority's Family Self Sufficiency Graduating Class. This wonderful program empowers families who want to transition from public housing to home ownership. Their stories are truly inspiring, and I wish them great success as they embrace the American dream.    Additionally, my team had the privilege of judging the Pasco County Science and Engineering Showcase. It is great to see students being exposed to a challenging STEM curriculum that encourages scientific discovery. These young students certainly have a bright future ahead.

I knew that it would be, as Speaker Pelosi later said it was, &#8220;a manifesto of mistruths.&#8221;&nbsp;I was frankly offended at the carnival barker-reality show quality of the speech after listening through the years to stirring oratory and lofty ideas from past Presidents. Not attending sent the right message: the current President isn&#8217;t worthy to address Congress from that iconic podium. See a release about my decision here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressing Disappointment at Trump&#8217;s Acquittal on Impeachment Charges&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was&nbsp;disappointed, but not surprised,&nbsp;at the Senate acquittal of the President on Wednesday.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;more than half the Congress has now voted either to impeach or convict&nbsp;him and his&nbsp;impeachment and abuses of power will always stain his presidency.&nbsp;I admire Senator Mitt Romney for being the one Republican senator willing to honor his oath and vote to convict. See my release on the acquittal here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commemorating Black History Month&nbsp;    February is Black History Month, and it&#8217;s a pleasure to consider Memphis' rich history of African American pioneers in almost every field of human endeavor. See my release about recognizing heroes from the arts, music, sports and other fields here. This&nbsp;morning I went to the Library of Congress to commemorate Black History month and have a breakfast with &#8220;Featherlight pancakes&#8221; made from Rosa Parks&#8217; own recipe. The Library of Congress is featuring Black History month on its website. See that here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioning FBI Director Wray about Hate Crimes&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee,&nbsp;I questioned&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;Director Christopher Wray&nbsp;at an oversight hearing&nbsp;on Wednesday&nbsp;about hate crimes and the increase in white nationalists and right-wing extremists. I also asked him about the 1955 Emmett Till lynching and whether cold cases from that era are being re-opened. See my release about the hearing and my exchange with Wray here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairing a Hearing on the Impact of the Supreme Court&#8217;s Citizens&nbsp;United Ruling&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;It has been ten years since the Supreme Court released its disastrous ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. On Thursday, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, I presided over a hearing on the impact of that&nbsp;decision and how unlimited corporate and dark money&nbsp;is&nbsp;corrupting our political system.&nbsp; See my release on the hearing, as well as my exchange with&nbsp;expert witnesses, here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping to Pass the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anecdotal evidence of the benefits of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress or other service-related disabilities is overwhelming. That&#8217;s why I&nbsp;supported&nbsp;passage of&nbsp;the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act&nbsp;on Wednesday, which&nbsp;will expand opportunities for veterans with PTSD to get involved with training and adopting service dogs.&nbsp;I was proud to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.&nbsp;See my release about the vote here.&nbsp;  Receiving Tennessee Alzheimer&#8217;s Leader Award&nbsp;    Left to right: Blake Dorsett, the Congressional Ambassador for the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association; Bailey Jones, who works for the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association; Congressman Cohen; and Rachel Blackhurst with the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association.  On Monday, representatives of the Tennessee chapter of the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association presented me with the Tennessee Alzheimer&#8217;s Leader Award at my Memphis office. See my release about it here.&nbsp;  Writing to President Trump about the Lack of Diversity in his Appointments&nbsp;   On Wednesday, I wrote to President Trump and urged him to consider diversity in his appointments, noting that his appointments to the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors included no minorities. See a release on that letter and its text here. On Thursday, I went to the House floor to make the same point, noting that just six of Trump&#8217;s more than 200 nominees to the federal judiciary have been African Americans. See my release and video of the floor speech here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announcing Grants to St. Jude and UTHSC&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, I announced that St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center would be receiving sizable U.S. Department of&nbsp;Health&nbsp;and Human Services grants. See that release here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign Up for &#8220;Congress on Your Corner&#8221; and this e-Newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies.

I use this as a venue to tell the story of how the work I'm doing in Washington and in the district impacts you. Each week I will highlight important pieces of legislation I'm working on, show you how I'm engaging with constituents on the issues, and tell you about upcoming events in the district.&nbsp;This week I'm back in Washington working on important legislation to improve public access to water in the Valley. Here are some highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Fighting for water   &nbsp; Water is the lifeblood of our Valley. Farmers need water to feed the world and life becomes near impossible for residents who lack clean drinking water. I introduced a bill to provide funding for necessary repairs to the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct. These waterways are critical to supporting our Valley's water needs, yet they are decades old and showing their age. We need to invest in our water infrastructure now, for the future sustainability of our state.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Expanding healthcare access           &nbsp;  California is expected to face a massive shortfall of primary care doctors in the next 15 years, especially in rural and low-income communities.&nbsp;I recently introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act to increase our supply of doctors by providing funding for additional medical training in diverse and medically deprived communities, like the San Joaquin Valley. At this year's State of the Union, I invited one of our local dedicated Valley health professionals to be my guest:&nbsp;Enid Picart.&nbsp;A fourth year medical student at UCSF-Fresno, Enid has chosen to dedicate her career to improving healthcare for San Joaquin Valley residents. We need more passionate people like Enid, who know our communities, to stay and commit to our future. With an investment in them, we can ensure every Valley resident has access to the healthcare they deserve. &nbsp;        Rep. Costa with State of the Union guest Enid Picart.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Honoring a hometown hero           &nbsp;  I introduced a resolution to honor&nbsp;a&nbsp;pioneer in the Latino community and Fresno native, Tom Flores, and urge he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Coach Flores was recently passed over for&nbsp;the honor despite his noteworthy achievements in the sport. As the first Latino starting quarterback and&nbsp;head coach to win two Super Bowls with the Raiders, and&nbsp;first Latino head coach and&nbsp;general manager of the Seattle Seahawks and in professional football history, his accomplishments on the gridiron prove he is&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;deserving of this honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Improving Valley infrastructure  &nbsp;  I'm pleased to announce that Merced County is opening Phase II of Campus Parkway and breaking ground on Phase III. When completed, this vital infrastructure project will connect UC Merced to both Highway 140 and Highway 99, improving traffic circulation, and&nbsp;providing better&nbsp;access to health services and economic opportunity. Working together in a bipartisan effort is key to improving our Valley's infrastructure.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Supporting global women's health   &nbsp; As a strong supporter of reproductive rights throughout my career, I believe it is critical for the United States to fund programs that improve the lives of millions of women around the world. In a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, we discussed the Global Gag Rule and other policies of this Administration to restrict access to family planning tools. Many of these policies have undermined the United States' commitment to global public health and resulted in economic and physical harm to women around the globe.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Pushing for responsible forest management  &nbsp;  One of my top priorities is to see our taxpayer dollars come back to the district. I'm pleased to report that the Fresno Regional Workforce and Development Board (FRWDB) secured an important CalFire grant to improve the health of our forests. Wildfires in California continue to have devastating impacts on our economy and air quality in the Valley. This new partnership will create 100 new skilled forestry jobs to help alleviate these effects. If we are to combat these growing threats, we need to bolster our efforts to responsibly manage our forests.&nbsp;   Other work on behalf of our Valley:&nbsp;  Voted to advance  that would provide funding to counter the damage Nutria are doing to our waterways in California.  about how legislation I helped introduce will&nbsp;&nbsp;for disadvantaged communities. The bill would also&nbsp;&nbsp;to increase storage and supply in our Valley.  to expand services and benefits to victims of Agent Orange exposure.  &nbsp;   Meeting of the Week:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's always a pleasure to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. This year at the United Nations Holocaust Observance, we had a productive discussion about building the relationship between the UN and our government in Washington, the UN's role in combating the climate crisis, and working to improve collaboration with our transatlantic partners. I will continue working with the UN and other nations around the world to promote global peace and prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upcoming Events Across the District:     &nbsp;  AARP Foundation Tax-Aide  &nbsp;  Free tax help for those with low- and moderate incomes, with special attention paid to those aged 60 and over.

I&#8217;m bringing Karen Battaglia, a nurse from Antioch as my official guest to the President&#8217;s State of the Union address!&nbsp;  Karen has spent most of her career working to improve the health and lives of thousands of people in our community. She is the Trauma Coordinator for Emergency Services at Northwestern Medicine McHenry, where along with her work to save lives, she is working to improve community safety. Throughout her time at Northwestern, Karen has coordinated community programs like SAFE Kids, poison prevention workshops, and community bicycle helmet fittings for children.  Karen also has asthma. For Karen and so many other Illinoisans living with preexisting condition (including me!), the State of the Union comes at a crucial time.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m so honored that when President Trump looks our way during the State of the Union, he&#8217;ll see not one, but TWO nurses with preexisting conditions who are fiercely fighting for their community.&nbsp;  The risk of losing protections for people with preexisting conditions is real, and it&#8217;s terrifying for so many. Republicans and this Administration have worked themselves breathless trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and throw our health care system in chaos. They failed in Congress, and now they&#8217;re pushing in the courts.&nbsp;  As a trauma nurse for over 20 years, Karen knows what&#8217;s at stake. She has seen how much access to quality, affordable healthcare has improved the lives of her patients. She&#8217;s also lived it, and knows how hard it would be for people like her and her grandsons with preexisting conditions to get care if crucial protections are stripped away.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m working every day to protect health care for Illinoisans, and Karen is exactly why. I am so honored to have her join me, and I&#8217;d be honored if you followed along!

I am an original cosponsor, one of a bipartisan group of four legislators upon introduction of the bill. I voted for it in the Natural Resources Committee, where it passed by unanimous consent. The Young Fishermen&#8217;s Development Act, H.R. 1240, promotes the development of the next generation of commercial fishermen with new federal grant support. Fishing is the lifeblood of our economy, and has always been part of the lives of islanders. This legislation would ensure that our young fishermen are equipped and trained from the start for a better career. A special thank you to my friend, Dean of the House, Rep. Don Young of Alaska, for introducing the bill along with the original cosponsors. The four of us represent congressional Districts that look to fishing as a staple of the area economy and a strong local tradition.  H.R. 1240 would create a national grant program through the Department of Commerce that &#8211; for the first time ever &#8211; would support training, education, and workplace development for the next generation of commercial fishermen throughout the country.

Soifua,   Member of Congress  &nbsp;     &nbsp;    American Samoa Quarter Event   In January, Congresswoman Aumua Amata welcomed the opportunity to visit the U.S. Mint headquarters in Washington, D.C., meet with Director David J. Ryder, learn more about the process and programs at the U.S. Mint, as pictured here, and enjoy an early look at the soon to be released quarter honoring American Samoa.  The new quarter has an artistic rendering of our distinctive Samoan fruit bats, known to be among the world&#8217;s largest flying mammals. The coin is part of the America the Beautiful Quarters Program by the U.S. Mint. Each coin program is authorized by the U.S. Congress to celebrate and honor various American places, events, and historical figures &#8211; this one celebrates American Samoa!  Our beautiful Park is one of five National Parks that will be honored this year by the U.S. Mint program. Governor Lolo will welcome Director Ryder for the announcement and official launch of the 2020 National Park of American Samoa quarter on Thursday, February 13, 2020, at Su&#8217;igaula o le Atuvasa, Utulei Beach Park, at 10 AM.    &nbsp;   Federal Response to Coronavirus The coronavirus outbreak is a serious matter, and federal authorities are taking numerous steps to contain it and develop treatment. Under the direction of the Health and Human Services Department, several agencies including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health have announced layers of efforts, including diagnosis and testing, exploring antiviral treatments, and working on a vaccine &#8211; totaling $105 million. It is a fact that there is travel between China and island nations in the Pacific region, including our closest neighbors in Samoa.  The Territory was right to alert our medical professionals here in the islands, then make any possible preparations in conjunction with all efforts at the federal level. The Trump Administration is consulting leading doctors and scientists, and in turn, they will keep the Congress informed. The budgets for these federal agencies include funds for vaccine studies and other steps, and these efforts are underway. Congress will be ready if called upon for any additional emergency funding if circumstances require it. Most of all, our prayers for those who are ill and the containment efforts.    &nbsp;   American Samoa Presentation to Vice President Pence  I had the opportunity to present our Territory's wonderful book on American Samoa, by author J. Robert Shaffer, to Vice President Mike Pence in person as a special gift from Governor Lolo and the people of American Samoa! The Vice President's own historic visit to American Samoa in 2017 is highlighted in the book on page 273. The book fit the theme of the evening perfectly, since the occasion was the swearing-in of President Trump's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders at a White House event in celebration of the Lunar New Year. At President Trump's invitation, I serve on the Commission, where I am able to add the viewpoint of an islander living in the islands.  Also, for the first time, there were three Cabinet members present for the proceeding. They included the co-chairs of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans &amp; Pacific Islanders, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, as well as U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia. The Initiative works to see that there&#8217;s cohesion across the many agencies of the entire U.S. government on policies affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Secretary Chao and Secretary Ross are pictured applauding our book presentation to the Vice President.    &nbsp;               Washington, DC Office 1339 Longworth House Office BuildingWashington,&nbsp;DC&nbsp;20515Phone: (202) 225-8577Fax:&nbsp; (202) 225-8757    American Samoa Office PO Box 5859,&nbsp;Pago Pago,&nbsp;AS&nbsp;96799Phone:&nbsp;(684) 633-3601Fax:&nbsp;&nbsp;(684) 633-3607Located at 1 Fagatogo Square      Click here to unsubscribe   Click here to comment or reply           ","district":"At-Large","title":"Delegate","gender":"F","state":"AS","party":"Republican","score":3.69964},{"name":"Senator Cory Gardner","address":"donotreply@gardner.senate.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-02","subject":"A message from Senator Cory Gardner","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }     p { margin-bottom:1em; }                            Home  Press Releases                Dear Friend,  Plans for New Airtanker Base in Colorado Springs The City of Colorado Springs and the United States Forest Service recently announced plans to build a new, permanent airtanker base and ramp at the Colorado Springs Airport.&nbsp;Our firefighters in Colorado and around the country risk everything to protect our communities, and it is our duty to make sure they have every possible tool at their disposal to safely fight wildfires.&nbsp;I&#8217;m excited to welcome this new airtanker base and ramp&nbsp;at the Colorado Springs Airport, which will serve as an incredible resource for the brave firefighters in Colorado and our surrounding areas.  Happy Birthday Colorado National Guard  On January 23rd, the Colorado National Guard turned 160 years old. Thank you to all of the past and present members of our Colorado National Guard for 160 years of dedicated service! We are proud of your heroic work each and every day.  The BLM Works for the West When it comes to managing our state&#8217;s treasured lands, it&#8217;s time for a little less D.C. influence and a little more Colorado common sense. As a fifth-generation Coloradan, I believe in Colorado and Grand Junction and&nbsp;I believe we are up to the task of being home to the BLM Headquarters. The great outdoors are part of who we are as Coloradans. We champion groundbreaking research into new alternative energy methods and technology to improve the environment, and we take immense pride that people from all over the world come to Colorado to enjoy our state&#8217;s beauty. Read my op-ed in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel on why Grand Junction is the perfect location for the BLM&#8217;s headquarters. Remembering the Horrors of the Holocaust   Seventy-five years ago this week, liberation arrived at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day we remembered the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jewish people who were murdered.  Wuhan Coronavirus Update Upon learning of the coronavirus outbreak in China, I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to ensure Congress is prepared to serve as a collaborative partner in a successful response. At my urging, the U. S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions held a briefing from a top public health official, and I stand ready to help local and state officials respond if the need arises. Congratulations to a Senate Page from Colorado Springs  Join me in congratulating Jennifer St. George from Colorado Springs on finishing the United States Senate Page Program! Jennifer represented Colorado as a Senate Page and I wish her the best in her future endeavors. High school students interested in applying to the U.S. Senate Page Program can find more information on my website. This program provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn about Congress while living, working, and attending classes for a semester in Washington, D.C.  Colorado Unemployment Rate Hits Historic Low Colorado&#8217;s unemployment rate reached a historic low as pro-growth policies are delivering for workers. In December, Colorado&#8217;s unemployment rate dipped to 2.5 percent, the lowest in more than 40 years and 1 percent lower than the national average. According to Ryan Gedney, a senior economist with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, &#8220;we&#8217;re seeing people find jobs that are a great fit for them and also we&#8217;re seeing really strong wage gains.&#8221; I&#8217;m proud of the great economic success we have achieved in Colorado, and I&#8217;ll continue to fight for policies that allow every corner of Colorado to grow and thrive. Firefighter with Colorado Ties Killed in Australia Wildfires  I&#8217;m saddened to hear of the loss of firefighter Ian McBeth, a graduate of Wray High School Class of &#8217;94, who was killed while volunteering in Australia fighting the wildfires. My family and I are sending our deepest condolences to his loved ones and brave firefighters everywhere. China Jails Student for Exercising Basic Freedoms China&#8217;s vision for a less free and open world has reached our shores. The Chinese Communist Party has now imprisoned a University of Minnesota student for practicing the most basic freedoms we cherish in the United States. The United States government has made clear through my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act that we will stand for a free and open Indo-Pacific where democracy and human rights are respected. I&#8217;m calling on the rest of the world to join us and open their eyes to the China threat.

Simply put, we cannot fight climate change without building a clean, energy-efficient economy. The legislation in my agenda aims to secure America&#8217;s path toward a sustainable future. Additionally, many of these bills have bipartisan support and demonstrate specific actions that Congress can take right away to reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to improve public health, strengthen our economy with green jobs, and protect the natural beauty we are so lucky to have in the Granite State. This week I also sat down with the Concord Chamber to discuss my Clean Energy Agenda and explore bipartisan solutions that can decarbonize our economy. From winter sports to maple harvesting, I look forward to my continued work to transition our state to a clean energy economy to protect all that makes the Granite State such a special place to call home. Empowering New Hampshire Businesses  This week I was glad to join community leaders at the New England Council (NEC) to give an update on my work in Congress and discuss how we can work together to grow New Hampshire&#8217;s economy and help our local businesses thrive. The NEC is a wonderful advocate for Granite State families and businesses &#8211; I look forward to our continued work together to ensure our state has the tools it needs to succeed and get ahead.       Working with community leaders to help the Granite State thrive.    Bipartisan Action to Prevent Fentanyl Overdoses&nbsp;  I led Wednesday&#8217;s House passage of the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. Fentanyl is killing people in New Hampshire and across the country. Communities throughout our state have been devastated by the opioid epidemic and we know that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are central to fueling this deadly crisis. We must use every tool available to reduce fatal fentanyl overdoses. On Wednesday, Congress took bipartisan action and averted disaster by ensuring that fentanyl remains a schedule 1 narcotic and members of our law enforcement community don&#8217;t have the rug pulled out from under them. I will continue to work across the aisle to ensure that we combat the opioid and substance abuse crisis from every angle.&nbsp;       Speaking on the House Floor about the legislation. Watch here.     USMCA Agreement Signed into Law  On Wednesday, President Trump signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. I voted in favor of the trade agreement last month, and I was glad to see Congress and the White House work together in a bipartisan way to get it over the finish line. Many Granite State businesses export goods and services to Canada and Mexico, and cross-border trade with our neighbors is crucial to the health and vitality of New Hampshire&#8217;s economy. The agreement signed on Wednesday includes provisions to enforce Mexico&#8217;s labor reforms and safeguard American jobs, more robust rules, and accountability mechanisms to protect our natural resources and improve access to Canadian markets for our dairy farmers.&nbsp;  In addition, House Democrats successfully blocked language in USMCA that would have raised prescription drug costs for Americans, and secured key enforcement provisions to protect American jobs and improve accountability with Mexican labor laws. The agreement that the President provided Congress had insufficient enforcement mechanisms in these key areas, and I was proud to work with my colleagues to fix these problematic aspects of USMCA. While I&#8217;m encouraged that the agreement includes improved environmental protections, there is more we can and must do to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to protect our environment, address climate change, and help the Granite State economy thrive. Honoring Christa McAuliffe  Tuesday marked the 34th anniversary of the Challenger disaster that took the life of Concord High School teacher Christa McAuliffe, along with the lives of fellow crew members Dick Scobee, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Mike Smith and Ellison Onizuka.&nbsp;  Everyone in New Hampshire remembers where they were on the day of the Challenger disaster. Our nation and the students who were privileged to have Christa McAuliffe as their teacher were heartbroken. Christa reached for the stars and inspired her students to do the same. I was honored to join my colleagues to help pass legislation just last year to create a commemorative coin to keep Christa&#8217;s pioneering spirit alive as she continues to spark a passion for science and exploration among younger generations.&nbsp;        Christa McAuliffe    My Guest at the State of the Union Next Week  I&#8217;m proud that Ross Cunningham, Superintendent of the Merrimack County Department of Corrections, will join me in Washington as my guest for the State of the Union Address next week. I deeply respect Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s extensive experience in our justice system and I am grateful for his dedication to ensuring vulnerable Granite Staters with substance use disorder can access the treatment they need. While we&#8217;ve made progress in our fight to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country, we have more work to do. Prevention, treatment and recovery go hand in hand with law enforcement in addressing substance misuse &#8211; we must end the cycle of addiction and incarceration. I&#8217;m glad to host Mr. Cunningham to signal our shared commitment to curbing substance use disorder and supporting those who struggle with addiction.  Here for You  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Patricia, a constituent from Littleton, who had an issue of concern regarding the Social Security Administration (SSA). My staff worked with SSA and helped resolve Patricia&#8217;s issue.

Rick Scott Applauds Passage of Resolution Recognizing National School Choice Week   Senator Rick Scott joined his colleagues in celebration of the passage of the resolution declaring this week as National School Choice Week.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud to join Senator Tim Scott and my colleagues to recognize National School Choice Week. As a father and grandfather, I know firsthand that every child learns differently and should have the opportunity to attend a school that best fits their needs. That&#8217;s why, throughout my time as Governor, I worked to make Florida a national leader in school choice, and as Senator, I&#8217;m working to build on these efforts to help our students succeed.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Tim Scott's HERE.  &#151;  Sen.

Rick Scott Applauds Interior Department&#8217;s Decision to Adopt No-Fly Rule for Drones Made in Communist China  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the Department of the Interior&#8217;s plan to formally adopt a no-fly rule aimed at drones made in China or with Chinese parts. Senator Scott introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, I&#8217;m glad to see the Department is putting national security first and adopting a no-fly rule for drones made in Communist China. The Trump administration sees the risks associated with using taxpayer dollars to purchase tech from a Communist government that is trying to spy on us. This is great news for our security. Now, we must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants. We must take the threat from Communist China seriously.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Urge President Trump to Include $250 Million for Everglades Restoration in Budget  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio in a letter to President Trump urging him to include $250 million for Everglades Restoration in his Fiscal Year 2021 budget requests to Congress.&nbsp;  This funding would build on the $200 million in construction funding for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Senator Scott, Senator Rubio and Governor Ron DeSantis fought for and secured last year, as well as the $2 billion in state funding invested in restoring the Everglades throughout Senator Scott&#8217;s time as Governor.

Rick Scott to Florida Ports and Airports: We Must Take Action to Protect Americans from the Coronavirus  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Directors of Florida&#8217;s Seaports and Airports urging them to take action and remain vigilant to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, Senator Scott urged the Trump Administration to declare a national public health emergency for the coronavirus to protect the health of Americans families.

Rick Scott Asks Peace Corps Director for Plan to Immediately Get Out of Communist China  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps&#8217; plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China. Since the Peace Corps announced its decision to wind down operations in Communist China this month, the Director has refused to take a meeting with the Senator to discuss next steps. This decision follows months of Senator Scott calling for the Peace Corps to get out of Communist China, and the introduction of Senator Scott&#8217;s Peace Corps Mission Accountability Act, which prohibits all Peace Corps activity in hostile countries, including Communist China.

Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;This week, I raised questions about the $12.5 million Foley &amp; Lardner received to represent the illegitimate Maduro regime and announced that I would no longer meet with anyone from that firm. I&#8217;m glad they made the right decision to drop the Maduro regime as a client and return the money. It&#8217;s unfortunate they made the decision to give this murderous dictator legitimacy in the first place. I would recommend to Foley &amp; Lardner that they get involved in support of the people of Venezuela.&nbsp;   &#8220;Nicol&#225;s Maduro is perpetrating a genocide on the people of Venezuela. I&#8217;ve been to the border between Venezuela and Colombia. I met young mothers who trek hours through the jungle just to get their only meal of the day. I met children who travel through FARC-controlled territory to Colombia to go to school &#150; the only way they can get an education. Thousands have died, millions have fled, and Maduro and his cronies have gotten fat and rich. I hope the last few days will serve as a lesson to any other lobbying firms, consultants or organizations that if you support Maduro and his gang of thugs, I won&#8217;t stay quiet.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senador Rick Scott: Si alguien apoya a Maduro, no me quedar&#233; callado  El senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaraci&#243;n luego de que el bufete de abogados Foley &amp; Lardner respondiera al llamado del senador de abandonar a su cliente, el inspector general Reinaldo Mu&#241;oz, el principal abogado del brutal r&#233;gimen de Nicol&#225;s Maduro en Venezuela. El senador Rick Scott dijo: &#8220;Esta semana, hice preguntas sobre los $12.5 millones que recibi&#243; Foley &amp; Lardner para representar al r&#233;gimen ileg&#237;timo de Maduro y anunci&#233; que no me reunir&#237;a con nadie de esa firma. Me alegra que hayan tomado la decisi&#243;n correcta de abandonar al r&#233;gimen de Maduro como cliente y devolver el dinero. Es lamentable que hayan tomado la decisi&#243;n de dar legitimidad a este asesino dictador en primer lugar. Le recomendar&#237;a a Foley &amp; Lardner que se unan en apoyo al pueblo de Venezuela.  &#8220;Nicol&#225;s Maduro est&#225; perpetrando un genocidio contra la gente de Venezuela. He estado en la frontera entre Venezuela y Colombia. Conoc&#237; a madres j&#243;venes que caminan durante horas por la jungla solo para obtener su &#250;nica comida del d&#237;a. Conoc&#237; a ni&#241;os que viajan a Colombia a trav&#233;s del territorio controlado por la FARC para ir a la escuela, la &#250;nica forma en que pueden obtener una educaci&#243;n. Miles han muerto, millones han huido y Maduro y sus amigos se han engordado y enriquecido. Espero que los &#250;ltimos d&#237;as sirvan como una lecci&#243;n para cualquier otra firma de cabildeo, consultores u organizaciones que si apoyan a Maduro y su banda de matones, no me quedar&#233; callado \".&nbsp;Lea m&#225;s AQU&#205;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration For Heeding His Call to Declare Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump&#8217;s decision to declare the 2019 Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States, and announcement that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended entry into the United States. This decision follows Senator Scott&#8217;s call last week for the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.  Last Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agency&#8217;s plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Last week, I called on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States, and I am glad they heeded that call today. Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy. We still need to take additional steps to protect Americans, including increased screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China.  &#8220;China needs to do more to keep the world community accurately informed about the spread of the virus and follow America&#8217;s lead to ground Chinese commercial flights.&#8221; Read more HERE.              Sen. Rick Scott Warns UK: Allowing Communist China in Your Networks is a Mistake  Ahead of the United Kingdom&#8217;s decision to allow Huawei, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China, to build part of its 5G infrastructure, Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner warning the U.K. about the extreme risks associated with this decision.&nbsp;  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;&#133;Johnson and other U.K. leaders must be extremely careful when it comes to the threat of communist China and the implications for the United States&#8217; relationship with the U.K.  Put simply, the U.K. allowing Huawei to gain a foothold would be a grave mistake.  Huawei is a bad actor across the globe. It&#8217;s a company that aids the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights, steal our data, technology, and intellectual property, and build up their military to compete with us and other freedom-loving countries.&#133;  Countries that do business with Huawei eliminate their citizens&#8217; and their country&#8217;s privacy rights.&#133;  Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party are one and the same. We can&#8217;t forget that.  If the U.S. is going to consider a trade agreement with the U.K., it is imperative that Huawei is recognized as a threat to our national security partnership. The U.S. must put any trade deal with the U.K. on hold until Johnson commits to take swift action to ensure Huawei will not be used in their transition to 5G networks. This is for the security of both the U.S. and the U.K.&#133;&#8221; &nbsp; Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.   &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Peace Corps Needs to Stop Wasting Taxpayer Dollars and Get Out of Communist China Immediately&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent op-ed on the Peace Corps&#8217; decision to end its programs in Communist China. Senator Rick Scott also sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps&#8217; plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China.&nbsp;  In the letter to the editor, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;&#133;I&#8217;ve met with the Peace Corps director multiple times and asked her what the volunteers did in Communist China and why they were there&#133;.  When I asked what the return on investment was for the U.S. taxpayers, the director (shockingly) had no answer&#133;.  The Peace Corps finally came to its senses this month and said it is leaving Communist China. Since then, the director has refused to meet with me. I would love to hear its plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.&#8221;  Read the full letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal HERE.  &#151;  AP:   Politico:   Florida Daily:  Fox News:   Fox News:   Breitbart:   Washington Examiner:   Newsmax:   Military Times:   Florida Daily: Rick Scott Has Questions for House Democrats On Impeachment  Florida Daily:   Florida Daily:   WPEC:  Florida Daily:  VPI TV:               Congratulations to part-time Floridian Derek Jeter on being recognized for his incredible MLB career and being elected to the Hall of Fame!  &#151;  Florida is home to the best airport in the nation!

The hearing this week on the Horseracing Integrity Act was an important step in advancing reforms to protect our equine athletes and jockeys. I remain firm in my belief that the future prosperity of this sport relies on uniformity of rules throughout the industry and I will continue to work to increase the popularity and public confidence in thoroughbred racing throughout the nation. You can watch my complete testimony from this week's hearing on the Horseracing Integrity Act here, and you can watch the entire hearing here.

THE LEXINGTON LEGENDS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR DISTRICT AND OUR COMMONWEALTH Earlier this week, I joined House colleagues from Minor League Baseball cities across the U.S. in fighting to preserve teams in our hometowns.&nbsp;Minor league baseball provides so much to our local communities, bringing family friendly entertainment, job opportunities and a significant economic impact to every city a team calls home. The impact of the Lexington Legends is no exception. The 2019 South Atlantic League Champion Legends bring an average economic impact of $47.2 million per year to our community, and in addition, donate an average of $1 million locally. I am committed to doing what I can to support the Legends and ensure that they stay in Lexington for years to come.

While much of the media attention has been on the partisan impeachment process, there have already been some major wins for Coloradans.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Jan 15, 2019  Last week, the Senate finally passed the USMCA and sent the deal to the President&#8217;s desk! This landmark trade deal between our two biggest trading partners will bring greater trade certainty for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families across the country. Colorado&#8217;s exports to Canada and Mexico totaled $2.7 billion in 2018 and the USMCA will support our state&#8217;s trade relationships for years to come. Before 2019 ended, I urged Nancy Pelosi to put partisan politics aside and hold a vote on the trade deal. I&#8217;m glad she listened and even more glad the Senate approved the package. Combined with the phase-one China agreement, under the current administration, the U.S. is making tremendous progress with our international trade partners.  Read my column on the USMCA in the Vail Daily here  We&#8217;ve also made important progress in our quest to bring broadband internet to underserved communities in Colorado. A recent FCC report shows there are rural areas in Colorado with less than 10 percent of the houses connected to broadband. In the 21st Century, this is a staggering statistic. I have introduced a bill that would help the two federal agencies tasked with planning broadband buildout areas work more quickly and efficiently. By reducing bureaucracy and eliminating duplicative measures under the FCC and the USDA, it is my hope that the planning process for broadband deployment will be expedited, saving time and taxpayer money. Alongside this legislation, I recently announced a $2.7 million grant that will help bring broadband to Dove Creek, Colorado. High-speed internet is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity in rural Colorado. &nbsp;  Here&#8217;s an in-depth look at what broadband means to rural communities from the Colorado Sun  Veterans issues continue to be one of my top priorities, and I have been encouraged by innovation we&#8217;re seeing at the Grand Junction VA Medical Center and elsewhere in the district. A new pilot program is helping veterans strengthen skills needed for employment after service. The Grand Junction facility is one of eight nationwide participating in this program, and it&#8217;s great to see success stories already. I visited the medical center this month and was glad to talk to the staff about their recent achievements. I believe that allowing the VA to test out pilot programs is critical to better address veterans&#8217; issues. Congress gave flexibility to the VA for these programs when we passed the MISSION Act in 2018.&nbsp;Another impressive accomplishment there was&nbsp;that a recent remodel of the third floor came in seven months ahead of schedule and $200,000 under budget!   Tipton visits with staff from the Grand Junction VA Medical Center  Coinciding with the MISSION Act, Congress just approved a waiver submitted by the VA to establish another pilot program focused exclusively on improving dental benefits for veterans. I applaud VA Secretary Wilkie&#8217;s commitment to improve dental benefits to veterans. Many of the more than 50,000 veterans living in our district are in rural areas and lack access to routine dental treatment. Along with these changes made to the VA, I have also introduced a bill to expand dental benefits to veterans with low-income. A lack of access to dental health is a risk to veterans&#8217; overall health. At the Glenwood Springs VA Medical Clinic, I was able to spend time with the staff and veterans there and discuss how we in Congress can continue to improve their care. This center is making great strides at providing veterans in rural areas of northwest Colorado a means to receive telehealth appointments, immunizations and many other services.   Tipton visits with veterans at the Glenwood Springs VA Medical Clinic  I&#8217;d like to close by talking about Colorado&#8217;s natural resources and energy future. My time in Congress has allowed me to support and promote the responsible development of natural resources through an all-of-the-above energy strategy. This type of model, implemented by the Trump administration, has led to a period of American energy dominance all while decreasing carbon emissions by 2.1 percent in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It&#8217;s vital that our state learn the hard lessons of the devastating impacts&nbsp;state-planned energy mandates have on small communities and instead work on plans that fit each community&#8217;s individual ability to provide affordable, abundant and reliable power to families and businesses. From the wind power production in Pueblo, solar farms in the San Luis Valley, hydro dams surrounding the Continental Divide, much progress has been made to bring clean energy to Colorado without heavy-handed legislation to force these changes. Alongside supporting renewable energy projects, I will continue advocating on behalf of other important energy infrastructure, such as the Jordan Cove pipeline and terminal project. These projects will provide good-paying jobs to the West Slope and provide cleaner energy resources to nations with abhorrent environmental records.  Read my column from last year regarding Jordan Cove  As much progress is being made around our district and state, there is plenty of room for improvement. I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of Colorado&#8217;s Third Congressional District this year and addressing these issues and the many others impacting our district in the new decade.   &nbsp;  ICYMI: Tipton in the News   GJ Daily Sentinel Editorial Board: Tipton Makes a Good Call on Farm Labor   Glenwood Post Independent: Scott Tipton backs national campaign to combat opioid addiction   Durango Herald: Should ending homelessness be a local and federal effort?

Honoring Waco Native and American Hero Doris Miller On Monday, I spoke at an event hosted by the United States Navy during which they announced the decision to name the newest aircraft carrier, CVN 81, in honor of Petty Officer Doris (Dorie) Miller. This is a meaningful recognition for a native son of Central Texas as Petty Officer Miller was from Waco, Texas, where he is a hometown hero and an inspiration to our community. It is fitting that we announced this decision at Pearl Harbor on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, because Dorie Miller, an African-American, distinguished himself as a hero during the attack that happened there on December 7, 1941. During the surprise attack by the Japanese, Petty Officer Miller left his post as a mess attendant on the USS West Virginia, went to the deck to man an anti-aircraft machine gun, and is credited with shooting down enemy aircraft. Dorie continued his service in the Navy during World War II until he was killed in action on November 24, 1943 when the USS Liscome Bay was sunk in the Pacific by a Japanese submarine. This significant recognition of this African-American hero serves as an inspiration to all our Nations enlisted military men and women, who come from a diversity of backgrounds and origins to serve in our Armed Forces. This initiative is a capstone addition to the prior recognitions of our local Waco hero, and builds upon the Congressional action that I initiated in 2015 to rename the VA medical facility in Waco as the Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Today, I join all Central Texans to celebrate and promote Petty Officer Doris Millers legacy of service and sacrifice as a national hero, motivating current and future generations of American Sailors as they selflessly serve to defend our liberty and freedom. Signing a Landmark Phase One Trade Agreement with China China has taken advantage of the United States for too long and the failures of prior administrations to address this issue have put American workers and job-creating innovators at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. Last week, President Trump once again took a stand for hardworking Americans when he signed the historic and enforceable phase one trade deal with China that achieves progress on a number of critical issues. This includes removing barriers that have unfairly limited U.S. exports and have prevented U.S. companies from competing in China. China has also pledged to increase its imports of U.S. agricultural products, energy, and manufactured goods by at least $200 billion. This successful phase one agreement marks an important step in rebalancing our trade relationship with China and they are a tremendous victory for the American economy  especially for our Texas farmers, manufacturers and innovators. President Trump is continuing to secure important victories for hardworking Americans. At the same time, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats, blinded by hatred of President Trump, continue to waste time by putting impeachment and hyper-partisan politics over progress. House Vote to Authorize Impeachment Managers Over four weeks ago, most House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump, while claiming that the nation was at risk if they did not rush the process. Then Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats delayed the vote to authorize impeachment managers and to transmit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, who has now commenced its trial to acquit President Trump. Contrary to the warnings of our Founding Fathers, the Democrats hate-fueled crusade to impeach President Trump was always nothing more than an exercise in raw partisan politics. If it was not clear before, then it certainly should be now, the Democrats have never had any interest in learning the truth. During this extended time, Nancy Pelosi sat on her partisan Articles of Impeachment in an unfounded attempt to gain leverage over the Senate. Americans now know that this delay was not about ensuring fairness. Rather, Pelosis tactics were strictly political. In reality, her charade only served to expose just how weak the Democrats case is and to expose their false assertion that impeachment was an urgent national security concern. Now that the impeachment sham has shifted to the Senate, it is my hope that the peoples House can finally get back to finding bipartisan solutions to our pressing issues-- including addressing border security, reforming our broken immigration system, addressing our health care system and prescription drug prices, and rebuilding our nations infrastructure. H.R. 1230 - Protecting Trial Lawyers Paychecks Act I am committed to protecting older Americans from workplace discrimination. Yet, the Democrats partisan and misleadingly named Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act fails miserably in this regard. I voted against this bill because it effectively serves as a blatant give away to wealthy trial-lawyers by making it easier for them to sue small businesses for lawful employment terminations not based upon age. Forcing a vote on a partisan bill that has no chance of passing the Senate and that has received a veto threat from the White House further illustrates how Democrats have failed our experienced workers by putting politics over progress. Marking the 47th Anniversary ofRoe v. Wade Also last week, I joined my colleagues in the Pro-Life Caucus on the House floor to mark the 47th anniversary of the Supreme Courts tragic decision inRoe v.

Safe travels back to the Natural State!  The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including a Resolution to approve a request from the Department of Veterans Affairs to pursue a pilot program to increase veteran access to dental care (H. J. Res. 80), the Homeless Assistance Act (), the Prudential Regulator Oversight Act (), the Expanding Opportunity for Minority Depository Institutions Act (), the Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience Act (), the President George H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act (), the 8-K Trading Gap Act (H.R. 4335), which requires the SEC to issue new rules prohibiting executives from trading during the four-day gap between when a significant event that impacts the company happens and when the company publicly files a Form 8-K to alert the public and shareholders of the event, the Veteran HOUSE Act (), a Resolution appointing and authorizing managers for the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, President of the United States (), the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (), and a Resolution providing for Congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to \"Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability\" (). Unfair trade practices and policies have allowed countries to win on the backs of hardworking Americans. For decades, China and many other players have taken advantage of the United States. The result has been jobs moved overseas, stolen intellectual property, currency manipulation, limited market access, and lost opportunity.  That changed when President Trump took office. One of his top priorities is to put America first and secure fair and reciprocal trade deals. He made clear that having a seat at the table isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; we need to be leading on issues that matter to the United States. And, this week, a momentous step was taken as the President signed Phase One of a historic trade agreement with China. With the advancement of this deal, we are righting wrongs that have hurt U.S. businesses, farmers, and families &#8211; and securing a more prosperous future for our exceptional nation. This fully enforceable agreement rebalances our vital trade partnership with China and boosts opportunity for American businesses, farmers, manufacturers, and innovators.&nbsp;Key provisions include:   American-made products: China has pledged to increase imports of American goods and services by at least $200 billion. &nbsp; Agriculture purchases: China will be purchasing billions of dollars' worth of goods from U.S. farmers. Market access: Decreased barriers for U.S. products, including beef, pork, rice, wheat, dairy, and more. No more forced technology transfers: For the first time ever, China agreed to end its practice of forcing American companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition for doing business there. Fairer currency practices: Beijing has agreed to stronger commitments on its practices regarding currency devaluations and exchange rates.  This isn&#8217;t the only recent trade win for our nation. Thanks to the President and the diligent work of U.S trade representatives, China reopened its markets to poultry &#8211; which was shuttered for years &#8211; and we have negotiated fairer policies with Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Canada. On top of that, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the critical USMCA passed the Senate this week and is now headed to the White House for signature! This agreement with Mexico and Canada provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity with two of our top trading partners. With a roaring economy and new trade deals with global partners, it&#8217;s evident now more than ever that pro-growth policies and strong leadership are ushering in a new era of prosperity, success, and growth.  Unfortunately, the concentration on delivering tangible results to the American people is not a priority shared by all of my colleagues. While President Trump signed the Phase One trade deal, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was handing out pens and posing for pictures smiling as she initialed documents to send articles of impeachment to the Senate. The contrast in agendas between parties couldn&#8217;t be more clear than those two images. As President Trump and Republicans fight to deliver wins to U.S. families, workers, farmers, and consumers, the Democrats remain transfixed with trying to remove a duly-elected President. Imagine the progress that could be made if all of Congress were focused on issues that contribute to the strength of the U.S. In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State and have a great Arkansan testify before the House Budget Committee. It was my distinct honor and privilege to welcome Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) Secretary Larry Walther to speak at a hearing titled &#8220;Why Federal Investments Matter: Stability from Congress to State Capitals.&#8221; Secretary Walther brought perspectives on Arkansas&#8217;s budget and planning processes, including the state&#8217;s focus on fiscal responsibility. As he noted, &#8220;Arkansas maintains a true balanced budget approach to funding state programs. We do not commit state dollars until we have those dollars in hand and available to spend.\" This focus on fiscal responsibility is something that Washington could use more of. The power dynamic between the federal government and state and local governments has become greatly skewed, overly dominated by federal control, and far out of line from what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The point is that state and local governments, along with private sector innovation, are best equipped to address domestic needs. The federal government should focus on finding more opportunities to stay out of the way.  At the hearing, . It is in the best interest of all to promote policies that reduce the federal imprint on state and local governments and encourage these institutions to address an increasing number of our nation&#8217;s domestic policy concerns. One-size-fits-all policies from bureaucrats sitting here in Washington do little to solve problems or address needs in Arkansas&#8217;s Third Congressional District or any other location far outside the Beltway. I thank Secretary Walther for his testimony and time.  I then sat down with Ferra Aerospace, an advanced machining and complex assembly company that is opening a facility in Rogers. Ferra's Arkansas facility will provide services to many leading companies including Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. I am thrilled that Ferra Aerospace is establishing a precision manufacturing facility in the Third District. The engineering and manufacturing talent in our region is second to none, and it&#8217;s notable that this global aerospace company is expanding into the Natural State. I welcome Ferra and its leadership to Rogers and look forward to working together to create jobs, grow the local economy, and support our military and defense industries. I wrapped up the week by sitting down with Brynt Parmeter, Walmart&#8217;s new Senior Director of Military Programs. Walmart is committed to supporting service members and their families, providing strong military spouse programs and veteran hiring commitments.&nbsp;Since launching&nbsp;the Military Spouse Career Connection (MSCC) on Veterans Day 2018, Walmart has hired more than 14,000 military spouses and remains ahead of schedule to meet its goal of hiring 250,000 military veterans by the end of 2020. Leadership, integrity, and commitment to service make our veterans outstanding employees. I&#8217;m pleased that many companies in AR-3 make it a priority to help service members transition back into civilian life and find new careers that leverage their skills.  Wishing you a great weekend, and I hope to see you around the Third District next week!

Pretty much my favorite hour of the week in Washington is the Wednesday morning prayer breakfast. First, it&#8217;s an island of calm and reflection in the midst of the intensity of the daily schedule; second, believe it or not, it&#8217;s the only non-official bipartisan event of the week; and finally, each week a senator is asked to present, ostensibly about their faith, but their remarks usually end up being mostly autobiographical&#151;and it&#8217;s always enlightening to learn about your colleagues.&nbsp;  I&#8217;m convinced that one of the most serious problems with the operation of the current Senate is that we don&#8217;t know each other&#151;and in the absence of relationships, there&#8217;s not much trust, and without trust, it&#8217;s hard to resolve serious issues&#151;and everyone retreats to their partisan corner.&nbsp; This photo was from our annual carol sing and this shot&#151;taken by Doug Jones (D-Alabama)&#151;captures the spirit of the thing: Debbie Stabenow, (D- Michigan) at the piano, my good friend Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) on the harmonica, Roger Wicker, (R-Mississippi), and Barry Black, our wonderful Senate Chaplain giving voice to Hark the Herald Angels Sing. We certainly don&#8217;t always agree and do spend a lot of time in those partisan corners&#151;except, that is, on Wednesday mornings. &nbsp; The Dogs That Didn't Bark  Senator King's column originally appeared in USA Today on December 2, 2019    One of Sherlock Holmes&#8217; most famous cases was solved when a&nbsp;normally noisy dog&nbsp;was silent the night of the crime,&nbsp;leading the famous detective to the deduction that it must have been an inside job &#151; the dog knew the intruder.  Those not barking today are the numerous Trump administration officials who are strangely silent&nbsp;when a few short statements (under oath) could go a long way toward exonerating the president from the charge of using the powers of his office for personal gain.  Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, former national security adviser John Bolton&nbsp;and probably at least a dozen White House and National Security Council&nbsp;staffers&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;all could clear up, one way or another, the essential question of whether the president was interested in corruption generally in Ukraine last summer, or whether the withholding of military aid and the dangling of a White House meeting was motivated by his personal and political interest in publicized investigations of the 2016 election and the activities of one of his principal rivals. And this would be direct evidence, which no one can call&nbsp;hearsay. Because it would be so easy for these people to clear the president, it&#8217;s hard to escape the conclusion that their silence is less about vague assertions of executive privilege (which isn&#8217;t available to cover-up wrongdoing, in any case) and more about not wanting to testify under oath as to what actually happened.  The president continuously proclaims his innocence (the call with the president of Ukraine was &#8220;perfect&#8221;, the impeachment&nbsp;proceedings are a &#8220;hoax,&#8221; a&nbsp;&#8220;witch hunt&#8221;&nbsp;and a relitigation of the 2016 election), which is his right. What is not his right is the active obstruction of the fact-finding process by blocking the testimony of useful witnesses as well as directly (and through his surrogates)&nbsp;attempting to intimidate&nbsp;those who have come forward.&nbsp; I know of no legal proceeding in any forum where the alleged wrongdoer controls the availability of material witnesses. In most situations, in fact, the very attempt to do so is a crime in itself.&nbsp;If the president is innocent, he should want &#151; no, he should demand &#151;&nbsp; that the above mentioned officials appear in a public forum, under oath and subject to examination, to set the matter straight, as soon as possible.    Legislative Update&nbsp;     Pushed to make rural broadband a top priority.&nbsp;The Senate passed a bipartisan bill cosponsored by myself and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) called the&nbsp;Broadband DATA Act.&nbsp;This bill&nbsp;would increase the accuracy of the Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s (FCC) broadband availability maps by improving the process by which broadband data is collected.

Maine Blueberries: Fighting for Farmers    Since the President started his tariff war with China, Maine&#8217;s wild blueberry producers have seen their exports to China drop by nearly 97%.   Despite this costly and harmful decline, wild blueberries have been left out of the Administration&#8217;s multi-billion dollar farm bailout. This is an unneeded hardship for Maine&#8217;s proud wild blueberry growers.&nbsp;Here's a few steps that I've taken to fight this:  I sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue urging them to help wild blueberry producers whose livelihood has been put at risk. I spoke on the Senate floor about the challenges facing Maine blueberry farmers due to the U.S./China trade war and China&#8217;s retaliatory tariffs.

David Perdue has thrust himself into an explosive Washington debate that could &#150; should things get out of hand &#150; threaten this nation&#8217;s most sacred institutions.  &nbsp;  And there&#8217;s Donald Trump&#8217;s impeachment trial to worry about, too.  &nbsp;  But more important than the man in the White House, at least on 13 Saturdays each fall, is the religion of college football. (And for those heathens in North Carolina and elsewhere, college basketball.) &nbsp;  Georgia&#8217;s soon-to-be senior senator has joined a bipartisan working group attempting to deal with the implications of a suddenly viral concept that burst from the West Coast only three months ago: That athletes should get a piece of the $14 billion in annual revenue that colleges and universities collect courtesy of their sweat and pain. &nbsp;  It is California&#8217;s fault. In September, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a measure to permit his state&#8217;s college athletes to be paid for endorsement deals, sponsorships, autograph signings and other ventures. &nbsp;  The California law won&#8217;t go into effect until 2023, but already similar efforts in 20 or more states have jumped up, blurring the political line that separates red and blue. In Georgia, state Rep. Billy Mitchell, D-Stone Mountain, says that by the time the Legislature convenes in January, his measure, House Bill 743, will have more Republican signatures than Democratic ones. &nbsp;  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has endorsed like-minded legislation.  &nbsp;  &#8220;So here we go,&#8221; Perdue said in a phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have an arms race between states about recruiting high school kids for college sports. That&#8217;s a problem. All of a sudden now, we need a level playing field. &nbsp;  &#8220;There are already high school kids that are being talked to around the country, about the California law,&#8221; Perdue said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be recruited in a year or so, but they&#8217;re being told now, &#8216;Hey, come to California and make some money.&#8217;&#8221; &nbsp;  The Senate effort is being led by Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn.  &nbsp;  Romney is credited with salvaging the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics &#151; an organization that has also had to come to grips with a shifting line between pure amateurism and the financial status of athletes. In October, Romney issued a warning to the NCAA, which has long balked at loosening rules on athlete compensation.  &nbsp;  &#8220;We&#8217;re coming for you,&#8221; Romney said. &#8220;We&#8217;re coming to help these young athletes in the future, and the athletes of today, make sure that they don&#8217;t have to sacrifice their time and sacrifice, in many cases, their bodies without being fairly compensated.&#8221; &nbsp;  Murphy has published two treatises on the college sports machine under the title of &#8220;Madness Inc.&#8221;  &nbsp;  &#8220;The current system does more to advance the financial interests of broadcasters, apparel companies, and athletic departments than it does for the student-athletes who provide the product from which everyone else profits,&#8221; the Connecticut senator wrote.  &nbsp;  Two other Senate members are former college scholarship athletes &#150; Marco Rubio of Florida and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The latter is also a Democratic candidate for president.  &nbsp; Perdue comes at the issue from the financial side. His first corporate turnaround of note was Reebok International Ltd. In 2001. Exclusive and unprecedented licensing agreements with the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League were crucial to the company&#8217;s revival. &nbsp;  In college sports, the money contest has long been underway, Perdue said. It&#8217;s just a matter of where that cash goes.  &nbsp;  &#8220;Look at the arms race among the top 50 college football programs,&#8221; the senator said. &#8220;Go to the University of Georgia and look at their infrastructure. Look at Clemson. Look at Alabama. There&#8217;s so much money around these top teams because of the TV revenue, because of ticket revenue, and the alumni support of those programs.&#8221; &nbsp;  Coaching pay, according to Murphy&#8217;s Madness Inc., has skyrocketed. Approximately 4,400 head and assistant coaches collectively receive more of the generated revenue than the nearly 45,000 student-athletes on scholarships. &nbsp;  Adjusted for inflation, Alabama coach Bear Bryant earned $1.1 million at the height of his fame. Nick Saban receives 10 times that.  &nbsp; As a political topic, compensation of college athletes is an issue fraught with racial divides. A 2017 poll by the Washington Post found that 54% of African-Americans support paying college athletes, but only 31% of whites felt the same. There was broader consensus &#150; 89% among blacks, 60% among whites - on permitting players to earn money if their name or image is used on merchandise. &nbsp;  This is where most legislation, state and federal, appears to be headed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &#8220;That&#8217;s the easiest to get at first. It&#8217;s not the only issue,&#8221; Perdue said. &nbsp;  But even that has complications. Consider the fleet-footed star running back and the anonymous lineman who plows the field ahead of him. &#8220;How do you allow a kid to get paid signing jerseys with his name on the back? And then, how do you split that with the other players on the team, and the university?&#8221; Perdue asked. Or should you? &nbsp;  There is a labor-versus-management aspect to the issue of athletic pay. Booker and most other Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed allowing athletes to earn money from their names and images. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts support allowing players to unionize as well. &nbsp;  Others, and Perdue is among them, emphasize the preservation of college sports as an institution in a shifting landscape.  &nbsp;  &#8220;My concern is that we don&#8217;t have agents sitting in kitchens signing contracts with high school kids and negotiating contracts &#150; instead of being recruited by colleges, destroying the student athlete,&#8221; he said.  &nbsp; Five years ago, the NCAA benched star UGA tailback Todd Gurley for four games &#151; for accepting money from autograph dealers. The Legislature quickly passed, and the governor signed into law, a measure aimed at those who tempt college athletes into risking their amateur status. The penalty: Jail time and a fine of up to $25,000.Those days appear to be on the edge of extinction. &nbsp;  In late October, meeting on the campus of Emory University, the NCAA&#8217;s top governing body voted unanimously to allow athletes to be paid for use of their name, image and likeness &#8220;in a manner consistent with the collegiate model.&#8221; &nbsp;  What that collegiate model is has yet to be defined. Perdue said the NCAA is expected to come up with preliminary rules in January, with a final decision coming in April. The Power Five conferences, the SEC among them, are working on the issue as well. &nbsp;  The senator hopes the two groups can come up with a solution that will pass muster with Congress. Lord knows, every sports bar in Georgia will be watching.  &nbsp;  ###  &nbsp;                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        &nbsp;  ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"M","state":"GA","party":"Republican","score":7.615665},{"name":"Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney","address":"carolyn.maloney@congressnewsletter.net","timestamp":"2019-12-23","subject":"A Look Back at 2019","body":"Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney Dear Lindsey, What a year we've had! It's hard to believe that 2019 is coming to an end. With a new year--and decade--ahead, I wanted to take a look back at all that we accomplished together this year. We got a lot done working for the American people, including: - Securing permanent funding of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund; - Becoming the first woman ever to chair the Committee on Oversight and Reform; - Reauthorizing the Debbie Smith Act to provide funding to test backlogged DNA kits; and - Impeaching the President Read more on all of this and more below. *Turning Promise Into Law: Honoring Our 9/11 Heroes * [image = *Congresswoman Maloney speaks at a press conference on the passage of *the Never Forget the Heroes Act* In February, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund announced that due to a funding shortfall, injured and ill 9/11 responders and survivors would receive significant cuts to their pending and future claims. I could not allow that. Fully funding and permanently authorizing the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund was the least we could do to honor the sacrifices of these brave men and women. After months of bipartisan work, during which i wore a firefighter jacket every day to reming my colleagues about the importance of making the program permanent, my bill, the Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, was signed into law in July. This would not have been possible without the incredible community of first responders, survivors their families who advocated tirelessly for this life saving legislation. With this bill, and the World Trade Center Health Program, the 9/11 community and their families now have a greater sense of security knowing that these resources will always be there for them. *Becoming the First Female Chair of The Committee on Oversight and Reform* In November, my House Democratic colleagues elected me as the new Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. I will do my best to follow the honorable example that the late Chairman Cummings left for us all. When I first came to Congress, I wanted to join this committee because it fights corruption, ensures transparency, and protects the American people. Today, these responsibilities are more important than ever. It is a great honor to chair the Oversight Committee, and I am humbled by the additional honor of being the committee's first woman chair. *Ensuring Funding to Reduce the DNA Testing Backlog* Across the country, DNA evidence sits backlogged and untested because forensic labs lack the resources to process it. That's why, in 2004, I wrote and passed the Debbie Smith Act. The legislation provided much-needed resources to law enforcement agencies to process untested DNA evidence. The National Institute of Justice reports that since 2005, Debbie Smith funding is responsible for 192,000 - or about 42% - of DNA matches in the FBI database. As importantly, it also provides some measure of justice to survivors of violence. Although the program lapsed for a few months, I am proud to say that the bill passed the Senate in December and is on its way to the President's desk. *Impeaching the President* Impeachment is not something that I take lightly. I took no pleasure in learning what I feel is disturbing information that led me to conclude that the House of Representatives must impeach the President. I did not come to Congress to impeach a president, but I feel that he has left us no choice based on his actions. I am proud of the honest, detailed investigative work that the Committee on Oversight and Reform did towards writing the impeachment report and in supporting the work of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. I cannot thank the staff enough for their dedication to getting this right, for our Constitution and the American people. *Guaranteeing 12 Weeks Of Paid Parental Leave For 2.1 Million Federal Workers* This month, the House and Senate reached an agreement to include part of my Federal Employee Paid Leave Act in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Federal workers will now receive 12 weeks of paid parental leave for the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. This ensures no federal employee must ever decide between being home with their new child or receiving a paycheck. While this is a win for many families, there is still more to be done. We continue to figh for universal paid family and medical leave for both the public and private sector employees across the country. That's why I held my first hearing as chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform on this very issue. Fighting for paid family leave for all Americans has and always will be one of my top legislative priorities. *The First Hearing on The Equal Rights Amendment in Three Decades* [image = *Congresswoman Maloney speaks at the House Committee on the Judiciary hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment* In April, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) held the first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. The ERA was first introduced in 1923 and prohibits denying equal rights on the basis of sex. Congress passed the ERA 47 years ago, but in 1982, the ratification deadline expired without securing approval from the 38 states required to amend the Constitution. Since coming to Congress in 1992, I have introduced legislation to restart the ratification process 12 times, and I was honored to testify at this historic hearing to make the case about why women's rights should be written into the Constitution. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to finally ratify the ERA. *Bearing Witness to Inhumane Conditions at Border Detention Centers* In July, I joined 20 other members of Congress to witness firsthand the horrific conditions at a border detention center in McAllen, Texas. What we saw was unacceptable: extreme overcrowding, no access to showers or toothbrushes, and people forced to sleep on concrete floors. Based on what I have seen and reports I have heard, I believe that the Administration's policies toward immigrants and asylum seekers is traumatizing and dehumanizing. We must treat all human beings with the dignity they deserve and never forget that our nation's diversity is its greatest strength. I am proud to represent a diverse constituency with immigrant communities that make New York City, and America, stronger. *The Economic Cost of Gun Violence: $229B per year* As Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I released a report detailing the economic costs of gun violence and held a hearing with expert witnesses who outlined how to end this epidemic. The report shows that gun violence costs our country $229 billion per year, let alone the immeasurable emotional toll gun violence places on our children, families, and loved ones. Even though New York is the fourth most populous state, it is not in the top ten when it comes to total gun violence costs. I credit our strong gun safety laws, which include an assault weapons ban. In my opinion, the federal government should look to New York as a model for federal gun laws. *Winning at the Supreme Court: Blocking the 2020 Census Citizenship Question* As co-chair of the House Census Caucus, I fought back against the Administration's efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census which census experts agreed would make the Census less accurate. They reported that including the question would lead to an undercount and therefore would undercut federal funding for minority communities and would deprive millions of Americans fair representation in all levels of government. In June, the Supreme Court delivered a victory for fair census advocates by ruling that the citizenship question could not be added to the 2020 Census. I remain laster-focused on ensuring a fair and accurate 2020 Census. *Cracking Down On Anonymous Shell Companies* The House passed my Corporate Transparency Act, which requires companies to disclose their beneficial owners at the time the company is formed. This prevents bad actors from using anonymous shell companies from thwarting law enforcement and hiding illicit activities. We are the only advanced country in the world that doesn't require this disclosure. The illicit use of anonymous shell companies is a pressing national security threat and this legislation is a straightforward solution. Beyond the impacts for law enforcement, this bill will also help to crack down on New York's real estate being used to park illicit money, driving up housing costs and limiting availability. It seems that more than ever before, there are too many dark windows in apartments in NYC at night - but with this bill, it is my hope that this practice will be put to an end. Too many anonymous LLCs instead of families own NYC apartments. The Senate needs to act to pass this bill without delay. Removing NYC Department Of Sanitation Trucks from East 10th Street* [image = *Congresswoman Maloney speaks at an event calling for the removal of sanitation trucks from East 10th Street* In August, I joined a group of local officials in calling on the NYC Department of Sanitation and Mayor de Blasio to immediately remove sanitation trucks that have been a burden on resident and business owners. I am thankful that Mayor de Blasio committed to removing these trucks. I look forward to the City finding a permanent location for NYC Department of Sanitation trucks that does not disrupt New Yorkers lives. *City & State's *2019 Women Power 100* List.* I was so proud to be named to City & State's *2019 Women Power 100* list because of my influential and senior positions on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, the Joint Economic Committee, and the Financial Services Committee. I am honored to be included on this list of so many incredible New York women. I want to thank City and State for including me, and I vow to keep working on behalf of women and our great nation every day. *Ensuring Businesses Can Access Terrorism Risk Insurance* Working with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee, we reauthorized the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in the bipartisan spending package ahead of the bill's 2020 expiration. After September 11th, the market for terrorism insurance completely shut down. Without it, construction stopped and thousands of jobs were lost. TRIA provides a backstop for terrorism insurance to make it both available and affordable at no cost to taxpayers. TRIA can't prevent a terrorist attack, but it can greatly lessen the financial impact. This program works and reauthorizing it ahead of its expiration was the right thing to do. *Allocating $25 Million to Study Gun Violence* For the first time since 1996, Congress has approved federal funding for the study of gun violence. I have been introducing a bill with Senator Ed Markey to do this for years now because gun violence is a public health epidemic, and it should be studied just like any other health crisis. The $25 million included in the 2020 spending package is a critical first step in addressing an epidemic that takes 100 lives per day. *Fighting for Helicopter Safety for NYC* When a pilot's failed emergency landing crashed into the AXA Equitable Center in Midtown Manhattan, we were reminded of the safety threat posed by non-essential helicopters. After what we felt was insufficient action by the Federal Aviation Admiinistration FAA), I joined with Jerrold Nadler (NY-10) and Nydia Velazquez (NY-7) to introduce legislation to prohibit these helicopter flights over New York City. This law aims to improve safety and quality of life for all New Yorkers. *Putting Public Housing Tenants First * I recently introduced the Public Housing Residents Protection Act to ensure that if and when a public housing authority (like NYCHA) decides to lease or sell any of its assets (like land or buildings), that the sale financially benefits the residents of these communities and the agency overall. Public Housing Authorities across the country should be making decisions with the same top priority: putting the residents' best interests above all else, this bill will ensure that. Also this year, I joined with residents of Holmes and Stanley Isaacs Houses, tenant leaders, and community groups as they filed suit to get necessary repairs to their homes without privatization of public housing. I am also a proud cosponsor of The Public Houseing Emergency Response Act and The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act to fund needed repairs, including the elimination of health and safety hazards from public housing developments across the country. *Opening the New Kosciuszko Bridge* [image = *Congresswoman Maloney celebrating the completion of the Kosciuszko Bridge with some of the workers who helped to build it.* On August 28, I was thrilled to celebrate the completion of our new, state of the art, Kosciuszko Bridge and to have helped secure $670 million in federal funds, roughly 85% of its total cost (*picutred right*). I feel that the Kosciuszko Bridge is an example of the great things New York and our nation can accomplish when we fund bold, innovative infrastructure projects. A city has to invest in itself to stay strong, and when I look at the Kosciusko Bridge and all the rest of our projects, I know that New York's future is incredibly bright. *Fighting Antisemitism Through Education* This year, as I have for many years, I introduced legislation to fight antisemitism through education. As a former educator, I know that education is key in fighting all types of bigotry and hate. As we see the rates of violent acts of antisemitism rising in our city, I remain as committed as ever to getting this bill passed to give educators across the country the tools and resources they need to teach about the dangers of antisemitism and hate. This bill has broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate and I hope to get it passed in the new year. *On Our Way to Building a Smithsonian Women's Museum* Last month, the Committee on House Administration unanimously passed my bill, H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act, to create a museum dedicated to telling the comprehensive story of American women throughout our nation's history. Creating this museum isn't just about understanding our past; it's an investment in our future. In celebrating the achievements of women in history, we're educating and inspiring the next generation to make history themselves. I've worked my entire career to make sure women are represented in the halls of Congress and seats of power. I'm proud we're well on our way to the day when women are celebrated for the history they've made and more young women are inspired for the future. I believe it would be very fitting to pass this bill in 2020 as we celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment which guarantees women's right to vote. As always, your concerns still and always will remain my top priority. Please do not hesitate to email me through my website.

On one side, you hear about impeachment and tweets, but, on the other side, you have members of Congress working together to get results. And in 2019, we've done just that. We've passed legislation that President Trump has signed into law to provide permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions, simplify the Federal Application for Federal Student Aid -- or FAFSA form -- 400,000 Tennessee families fill out every year to qualify for student aid, provide our troops with the biggest pay raise in 10 years, encourage drug competition, raise the tobacco age to 21 and provide record-funding for our 17 national laboratories and supercomputing. Congress has also confirmed five Tennesseans who were President Trump's nominees. And, as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I've worked to pass 21 bills in our committee, including new laws that will ensure we are better prepared for public health threats such as wildfires, hurricanes, or bioterror attacks and to help us better understand diseases and disorders including Lyme disease, approved 51 of the president's nominees and held 13 hearings hearing on topics that impact the lives of every American, including e-cigarettes and vaping, the importance of vaccines, and updating the Higher Education Act to ensure students are earning degrees worth their time and money. It's been quite a year, and you can learn more about what we've been able to accomplish HERE [link 1]and HERE [link 2]. * * *President Trump signs into law legislation that will lower Americans' health care costs* The U.S. Senate passed, and the president signed into law, legislation that takes several important steps to address Americans' number one financial concern: what they pay out of their own pockets for health care. The new law includes five provisions from my bipartisan legislation the Lower Health Care Costs Act [link 3] -- including the CREATES Act, which will increase generic drug competition and lower the cost of drugs -- as well as two provisions to increase biological drug competition and lower drug costs, including in the insulin market, Tobacco-21, which will raise purchasing age of tobacco to 21, and the Kay Hagan Tick Act to better protect Americans from diseases transmitted by ticks, mosquitoes and fleas. But there is more we need to do. I will continue working with my colleagues in the New Year to end surprise medical billing, deliver long-term funding for the nation's 1,400 community health centers -- including the 29 in Tennessee -- lower the cost of prescription drugs, and bring more transparency to the health care market. [image = *I've enjoyed spending some time with Payton, who is a junior in high school from Brentwood and has been serving as a U.S. Senate Page this semester. Thank you for your impressive work and service, Payton!* *President Trump, Congress give troops biggest pay raise in 10 years* The U.S. Senate passed legislation [link 4] Tuesday that gives the military the biggest pay raise in 10 years. President Trump has signed this bill into law, which authorizes $738 billion to fund the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. Governing is about setting priorities, and this bill shows our priority is the men and women who serve in our armed forces. This defense bill authorizes pay raises for troops at Ft. Campbell, Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma and the Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, and continues to make research and development of new technologies a priority so our military can deal with new and emerging threats. The new law improves housing and increases employment opportunities for military spouses. This new law also, for the first time, provides two months of paid family leave for all federal employees, which Ivanka Trump and the President worked to include in the bill. This legislation will also strengthen our national security by supporting important programs at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge to help modernize and maintain our nuclear weapons arsenal.

First, it provides permanent funding, fully paid for, for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions attended by over two million minority students. Second, after five years of bipartisan effort, the measure also simplifies the Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) and removes the most important roadblock for the 20 million Americans, including 400,000 Tennessee families, who apply for federal grants and loans to attend college. Last week, the president of Lane College -- one of six HBCUs in Tennessee -- told me that he has three staff members who spend a significant amount of time helping the 40 percent of Lane College students who are currently selected for verification each year, a complicated bureaucratic process that stops a student's Pell grant payments while they send their tax information to the U.S. Department of Education. This legislation greatly reduces this burden on his students and their families and allows the staff to spend their time counseling students about academics or jobs, instead of helping them fill out a form. President Trump signed this important legislation into law, giving a Christmas present to HBCUs and millions of students and their families.

I'm grateful the Tennessee Titans continue to invest in the Nashville community and bring even more jobs to Middle Tennessee. * * * *President Trump, Congress provide record-funding for 17 national laboratories, supercomputing* The best-kept secret in Washington is record-funding for the Office of Science, which funds our national laboratories and supercomputing [link 6]. The legislation the Senate passed Thursday will provide record-level funding for the fifth-consecutive year for our 17 national laboratories. Our national laboratories are our secret weapons, which is why I've worked hard as chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee to help increase funding for the Office of Science by 38 percent over the last 5 years. The legislation also includes $230 million for the first year of a new advanced reactor demonstration program, which will build at least 2 advanced reactors over the next 5-7 years. This bill includes funding to keep America number one in the world in supercomputing and build the next generation of supercomputers. The funding in this bill will also modernize our nuclear weapons facilities at Y-12 and accelerate cleanup of hazardous materials and facilities at the East Tennessee Technology Park, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex, which is building the largest federal construction project in Tennessee since World War II. Our legislation also includes $7.65 billion -- a new record funding level in a regular appropriations bill -- for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain and rebuild our nation's waterways, including up to $94.5 million to fully fund construction at Chickamauga Lock for the sixth consecutive year. This is great news for East Tennessee since the new lock will help keep up to 150,000 trucks off I-75 and keep the cost of shipping goods low for manufacturers across the state. Finally, our bill includes up to $2.163 million for dredging the Memphis Harbor McKellar Lake. This is an important bill for our country and for Tennessee, and I'm glad President Trump signed it into law. Funding these priorities is not the cause of the runaway federal debt. These priorities are funded in the portion of the budget that only increases at about the rate of inflation. *Below are some articles from this week I thought you would enjoy:* Chattanooga Times Free Press: Alexander touts elimination of 'bureaucratic nightmare' provision on student federal college aid applications [link 7] * * Kaiser Health News: Surprising Swings In Momentum For Legislation On Surprise Medical Bills [link 8] Ed Week: What the FAFSA Simplification Trump Signed Means for Students [link 9] Remember that the family is the basic unit of society. *#162 in Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book* ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] [link 9] Contact Information: Website: Office Location: Washington, DC Office 455 Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC 20510 Phone: (202) 224-4944 | Fax: (202) 228-3398 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"5","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"LA","party":"Republican","score":3.7318306},{"name":"Senator John Boozman","address":"donotreply@boozman.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-12-18","subject":"Boozman Bulletin: Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Battle\r\n of the Bulge","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                                                         &nbsp;  Boozman Bulletin:&nbsp;Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge   On December 16, 1944 in the Ardennes Forest of Luxembourg and Belgium, American soldiers were unexpectedly attacked by German forces. The Allies were unprepared, outnumbered and facing record-low temperatures with dwindling supplies. Still, the men on the frontlines dug in to defend against the enemy at the Battle of the Bulge, a critical engagement of World War II.  Arkansan Bill Strauss was one of the brave men who faced the bitter cold, with lack of sleep and a shortage of food. He and his fellow troops endured this extreme test of will and resolve.&nbsp;  I met with Bill this year to help him celebrate his 100th birthday and thank him for his service and continued commitment to sharing his experiences with the community. It&#8217;s been 75 years, but Strauss&#8217; recollection of the details of the unimaginable circumstances he faced was still very clear. He talks about his memories in the Battle of the Bulge in order to honor his fellow soldiers who weren&#8217;t so fortunate as well as teach succeeding generations about the realities of war and the remarkable perseverance of American troops.&nbsp;  The six-week battle demonstrated the commitment, courage and resilience of Bill and all American soldiers. It was the largest battle ever fought by the U.S. Army. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called it &#8220;the greatest American battle of the war.&#8221; It came at a considerable cost. More than 89,000 American soldiers were casualties including 19,000 soldiers killed, 47,500 wounded and 23,000 captured or missing in action. The people of Belgium and Luxembourg have a close place in their hearts for American soldiers who sacrificed their lives on foreign soil. They continue to display that gratitude today.        Thanking a Battle of the Bulge veteran for his service at an event recognizing the valor of American troops.    This past weekend I led a group of my fellow senators to both countries to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.&nbsp;I was honored to visit with the American veterans who fought in the battle and were returning to the land they&#8217;d defended. There are fewer and fewer who are able to join, but that doesn&#8217;t diminish what they did there or the steadfast way they fought and sacrificed in the name of freedom.&nbsp;  We can be proud of the unwavering bravery of the American troops and the Allied Forces whose efforts defeated the German attack and led to the end of the Nazi regime.&nbsp;  I was honored to support the Senate-passed resolution recognizing the 75th anniversary of this battle and honoring the heroism of the troops who helped secure this victory. As we reflect on this occasion, let us protect the legacy of brave individuals like Bill and countless others whose courage and sacrifice secured peace in Europe.  &nbsp;_______________________________________________________________________  Quick Takes:     Urging Passage of USMCA trade agreement: Modernizing our trade deal with Canada and Mexico will deliver wins for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and businesses in Arkansas and across the nation. The Trump Administration and particularly Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, has worked incredibly hard to make this deal possible. I'm looking forward to reviewing the final details of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and hopefully getting it across the finish line soon. I highlighted a report produced by the World Trade Center Arkansas to make the case for the passage of this trade agreement.   Investing in National Security: On Tuesday, the Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This legislation is critical to ensuring service members have the tools and resources they need to protect national security. I'm pleased provisions for which I advocated are included in the bill. It repeals&nbsp;the Widow's Tax, allows a land transfer that will&nbsp;expand burial space for veterans&nbsp;at the Arkansas Veterans Cemetery, authorizes additional full-time Air Force Reservists &#150; one of the top priorities for the Air Force Reserve, expands Arlington National Cemetery and broadens Wounded Warriors Adaptive Sports programs.

This week, I went to the Senate floor to emphasize the stakes of protecting our health care system from partisan attacks by sharing the story of Cassandra Van Kuren of Manchester who has struggled with the costs of treating her type 1 diabetes.  Cassandra, 26, is passionate about fitness and staying healthy. That&#8217;s why it was so devastating that a week before she turned 25, she got the news that she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Cassandra&#8217;s life had been turned upside down.  And after her diagnosis, she was immediately hit with another shocking blow: the costs associated with her condition. Within the first week of her diagnosis, she was forced to max out her credit card. And to this day she is still paying back all of the bills she accumulated within her first month of being diagnosed.    To watch WMUR&#8217;s coverage of Cassandra&#8217;s story and my floor speech click here.  Families in New Hampshire and all across the country cannot afford these reckless attacks on their health care. And they want us to work together on constructive, bipartisan solutions that improve their lives and lower their costs, not this constant uncertainty and sabotage. That is why this week I called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for blocking critical legislation that passed the House on Thursday that would lower prescription drugs costs for hardworking families.  I&#8217;ll continue to share stories like Cassandra&#8217;s and work with anyone who is serious about actually improving our health care system &#150; not undermining it. With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On This week, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee reauthorized the bipartisan Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which includes measures that Senator Hassan fought to include to ensure that family members caring for children who have been exposed to substance misuse or other trauma are eligible for necessary child support services.

The Senate also voted to send to the President&#8217;s desk the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act, bipartisan legislation Senator Hassan cosponsored that is aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans.

Unemployment rate held at 3.5%, the lowest it has been since December 1969! This is great news! A prosperous economy means more opportunities are provided for Floridians and Americans across the nation. Since day one, President Trump made it a priority to remove unnecessarily burdensome regulations that were crippling job and wage growth and hurting American small business owners. These results are proof our economy will prosper when leadership sends the clear message America is open for business and government gets out of the way of hardworking Americans.    _______________  On Monday, I was pleased to announce Xander Jenkins as the 2019 Congressional App Challenge winner for our district. Jenkins, an 11th grader from Citrus County created an app which allows users to take a photo on their phone, upload the photo into the app, and detect any color that is present within the photo. As an electrical engineer, I am passionate about computer science and STEM-based education. These skills are essential as our economy continues to prosper and remains the global leader in innovation. Xander&#8217;s app will be featured on the U.S. House and App Challenge&#8217;s websites and is eligible to be displayed&nbsp;in the Capitol Building for one year. A total of 35 students and 16 teams from schools across District 11 participated in this year&#8217;s challenge. Visit my website to learn more about the Congressional App Challenge.    _______________  The Democrats continued their impeachment obsession as the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing with college professors as witnesses. &nbsp;The professors discussed the Founding Fathers&#8217; view of impeachment, constitutional definitions and past impeachment proceedings.&nbsp; Only one of the witnesses was nonpartisan, Professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University. Not surprisingly, committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and the majority members of the committee called in three liberal, anti-Trump professors to testify. &nbsp;In fact, one of the witnesses &#8211; &nbsp;Professor Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School recently stated she reacted so strongly to seeing the Trump Hotel in D.C. she had to cross the street instead of walking in front of it! &nbsp;Hardly an unbiased witness. I was struck by Professor Turley&#8217;s testimony and comparisons between this process and historical ones. He testified that House Democrats were conducting &#8220;the fastest impeachment\" and that he was \"concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger.\" He exhorted the committee to slow down, subpoena witnesses who may have direct knowledge of the events in question and use the courts if necessary, to settle disputes between Congress and the Trump administration.           The next day, the Democrats proved once again this is not about getting the facts, but about overturning the 2016 election results and preventing President Trump from being re-elected. Thursday morning, despite still not having received testimony from key witnesses that advanced their narrative or connected the President to their bribery, extortion, or quid pro quo allegations, Speaker Pelosi announced she was directing the House Judiciary Committee to prepare Articles of Impeachment.  _______________  At every turn, House Democrats are doubling down on their decision to play politics over tackling the issues most important to hardworking Americans.&nbsp;The most recent example, is H.R. 4, which I voted against last week. This bill is another attempt by Democrats to give partisan activists the power to undermine the integrity of our election laws for their political benefit. This bill uses the power of the federal government to overturn voter ID laws and prevents states from ensuring the integrity of their own elections.  Contrary to their explanations, this bill does not reauthorize the Voting Rights Act nor protect Americans from voter discrimination based on race or gender. It does not empower states to ensure our election systems are secure against cyber or other attacks.&nbsp; This is a power grab that would allow federal bureaucracies to manipulate voting rules for partisan political advantages. Election integrity is a critical component of the American system. Instead of promoting election integrity, this bill promotes the interests of Washington politicians and special interest groups.  _______________  On Wednesday, I attended Holiday Mail for Our Heroes, hosted by the American Red Cross. Every Christmas, the Red Cross hosts this opportunity to write several letters to members of our military who will be spending the Christmas season away from their families while they are stationed in Kuwait, Iraq, Poland, Romania, and Djibouti. Sending our servicemen and women Christmas cards of thanks is a small expression of our gratitude for their service. We owe them a debt we can never repay.&nbsp;    _______________  Christmas celebrations are in full swing across the district. On Saturday enjoyed being a part of Lady Lake's annual Christmas Parade.&nbsp;It was great to see so many friends and neighbors out celebrating this holiday season.   _______________ Residents of Ridge Manor! Stephen, my Director of Constituent Services, will be at the Community Center of Ridge Manor on Wednesday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.&nbsp; He will be available to assist constituents with issues involving federal agencies, including, but not limited to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Department of Veterans Affairs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social Security Administration &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal Revenue Service &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United States Postal Service &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Stay Tuned!

Legislative Update Last week, I voted against H.Res. 326, a non-binding resolution regarding the ongoing violent conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East. This resolution asserts that the U.S. House of Representatives believes a two-state solution is the only viable acceptable solution for this conflict. Most troubling, this resolution was a veiled attempt by House Democrats to punish the Trump Administration for reversing the Obama-Era approach to Israeli settlements in the West Bank.&nbsp; I supported the administration&#8217;s decision to recognize these Israeli settlements. I am thankful that the Trump Administration has made clear on the world stage that the United States wholeheartedly supports Israel. President Trump has taken great strides in this relationship, including fulfilling a promise made by four preceding presidents - moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, Israel&#8217;s capital.&nbsp;    Survey By October 1, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security will require a REAL ID compliant driver&#8217;s license for air travel as part of minimum security standards.&nbsp;  Have you obtained your REAL ID yet?&nbsp;   Yes No Unsure  More Information on REAL ID can be found here.&nbsp;   Results of  which asked... \"Did you participate in Black Friday and/or Cyber Monday\" Yes - 38%, No - 62%        &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington1210 LongworthWashington, DC 20515202-225-1002 Leesburg318 South 2nd St #ALeesburg, FL 34748352-241-9220 Inverness212 W.

I'm excited to say our agreement between the House and the Senate to end robocalls was passed by the House this week. I've been working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee on this legislation to finally end robocalls once and for all. It is estimated that there were nearly 48 billion robocalls in 2018 nationwide. This is an increase of more than 64 percent since 2016. Robocalls are more than just a nuisance. They can scam consumers and even block hospital phone lines. The Senate is expected to officially approve the agreement soon. I look forward to President Trump finally signing this critical legislation into law. Also this week, House Democrats continued their impeachment sham. Shockingly, Democrats brought liberal professors to Congress to give their opinions. However, you can't impeach the President of the United States based on opinions. You need facts, and the Democrats do not have a case for impeachment. Catch up on these issues and more in this week's Buddy's Briefing. Click here to watch Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXLI Monday, December 2, 2019: Im in Alma in Bacon County early this morning as I am hosting an H2A roundtable discussion designed to bring local farmers together with federal and state agencies that deal with the program. The H2A program is a federal program that allows employers to apply for guest workers from other countries to perform seasonal or temporary farm work for a maximum of ten months. Representatives from the four main agencies involved in this process, United States Citizens and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Labor (DOL), Homeland Security, and Department of State (DOS), join us at the roundtable via telephone. Those physically attending the meeting are representatives from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Georgia DOL. Rep. Carter hosts an H2A roundtable discussion Each agency briefly describes their role in the H2A process and offers suggestions as to best practices for the employers before answering questions of the employers. Afterwards, I fly to Atlanta where I join the Ripon Society on their Atlanta Main Street Policy Tour as we visit corporate sites in the city to learn more about the major companies in the area. Our first stop is IBM where we tour the X-Force Exchange, a cloud-based threat intelligence platform that allows the company to consume, share and act on threat intelligence through human and artificial intelligence (AI).  Reps. Carter and Bucshon at Home Depot headquarters Next, we head to Aflac, the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the US, where we have a conversation on innovation, cyber security, and robotics with their Global Cyber Security and Chief Digital Information officers. Our final stop of the day is to the headquarters of Home Depot, Americas largest home improvement retailer with over 2,200 stores across North America, where we discuss trade issues and asset protection. Tuesday, December 3, 2019: This morning we visit yet another great Georgia company, Delta Airlines, whose headquarters are at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL) and where we have a behind-the-scenes look at how the airport operates. ATL is the worlds busiest airline hub with over 7,000 airport customer service employees working above-wing, below-wing and in cargo.

Having served in combat and commanded troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and with her own daughter going through training right now at West Point, Senator Ernst understands just how important it is for all servicemembers to be properly equipped for the battlefield. The Washington Times covered Senator Ernst&#8217;s efforts.   Click here or the image above to read the article in The Washington Times.  &nbsp;  Calling on Congress to Support Our Men and Women in Uniform  On the heels of her recent bipartisan, bicameral Congressional delegation visit to Kuwait and Afghanistan, Senator Ernst once again called on Congress to support servicemembers and come together to pass the annual defense authorization bill, as well as defense funding for this next fiscal year.  Ernst outlined the importance of ensuring our servicemembers, like those she visited in the Middle East just last week, have the necessary resources to carry out their mission of protecting the homeland. The Senator said in part: &#8220;Our men and women overseas are serving our purpose abroad&#133;now it&#8217;s time for Congress to serve their purpose.&#8221;    Click here or the image above to watch Senator Ernst&#8217;s remarks.  &nbsp;  Amping Up the Pressure on Speaker Pelosi to Move on USMCA  Following the one year anniversary of President Trump signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Senator Ernst, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Energy and Rural Development, continued to call on Speaker Pelosi and her House colleagues to move on the trade agreement.

Myers to Serve as District Judge for Eastern North Carolina in Historic Vote","body":"Richard Burr, US Senator North Carolina *Senate Confirms Richard E. Myers to Serve as District Judge for Eastern North Carolina in Historic Vote* Yesterday, the Senate voted to confirm a well-qualified and widely respected legal scholar to serve as a U.S. District Judge for Eastern North Carolina. Professor Richard Myers was confirmed by a strong bipartisan vote of 68-21. I was honored to speak on the Senate floor ahead of his vote to urge my colleagues to support his nomination to the bench. [image = [link 1] *Sen. Burr speaks on the Senate floor ahead of Professor Myers' confirmation vote this week. To watch his full remarks, click here [link 2].* *\"First thing I want my colleagues to know is that Professor Myers embodies a work ethic and diligence that we deserve in all our judges. As an immigrant of Kingston, Jamaica, Professor Myers was the first generation college student in his family. He worked his way through undergraduate, his undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and after college pursued a career in journalism. He worked for the *Wilmington Morning Star*and it was his investigative reporting that gave him the desire to earn his law degree. He graduated Magna Cum Laude at the University of North Carolina Law School and began a legal career as a clerk for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. District Court of Appeals.* *\"Second, Professor Myers will be a judge who understands the value of public service. Having made a career change from practicing at a prestigious private firm, to contributing to our nation's justice system, following the attacks of September 11, 2001. He said that his change in career, and I quote him, 'was something I felt I could do and that I owed the country that had been really good to my family,' unquote...Professor Myers then took a different path of service at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill instructing the next generation of lawyers to be people in his own words, and I quote, 'do the right thing, every day,' unquote.* *\"If confirmed, Professor Myers will serve on the Eastern District of North Carolina and as Senator Tillis said will hold court in Wilmington. Ironically, this court is currently meeting in the building that once housed the *Wilmington Morning Star*- his first job as a reporter. However, when considering Professor Myers' story, it seems fitting that someone with the character, work ethic, and service approach to life will be returning to the building of his first post-college job wearing a robe of a federal judge.* *\"I have faith in Professor Myers ability 'to do the right thing, every day' in this critically important role and I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak on his behalf to our colleagues.\"* ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] Contact Information: Website: Office Locations: Asheville Federal Building 151 Patton Avenue, Suite 204 Asheville, NC 28801 Phone: (828) 350-2437 Fax: (828) 350-2439 Rocky Mount 100 Coast Line Street, Room 210 Rocky Mount, NC 27804 Phone: (877) 703-2087 Phone: (252) 977-9522 Fax: (252) 977-7902 Washington, DC 217 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Phone: (202) 224-3154 Fax: (202) 228-2981 Winston-Salem 2000 West First Street, Suite 508 Winston-Salem, NC 27104 Phone: (800) 685-8916 Phone: (336) 631-5125 Fax: (336) 725-4493 Wilmington 201 North Front Street, Suite 809 Wilmington, NC 28401 Phone: (888) 848-1833 Phone: (910) 251-1058 Fax: (910) 251-7975 Unsubscribe: Privacy Policy: ","title":"Senator, 3rd Class","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":4.6048594},{"name":"Office of U.S. Senator Mitt Romney","address":"enewsletters@romney.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-12-06","subject":"Weekly Recap Advancing Foreign Policy & Health Objectives","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }   @media screen and (max-width: 497px) { a { text-decoration: none;} .mobile-menu {font-size:20pt !important;} .mobile-content {font-size:12pt !important;} .mobile-footer {font-size:8pt !important;} }                     Dec. 2 - Dec. 6, 2019         &nbsp;        This week, Senator Romney continued his leadership on foreign policy issues,&nbsp;chairing a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing on the impact of recent protests in Lebanon and Iraq on U.S. national security interests, raising awareness of&nbsp;the increasing threat China poses to global order, and stressing&nbsp;the need for the U.S. to remain clear-eyed about Russia's intentions&nbsp;when evaluating our future policy. Closer to home, Senator Romney also continued advocating for the need to tackle the youth vaping epidemic, introduced legislation to combat the circulation of opioids through the mail, and met with several groups of Utahns. Keep scrolling for a brief recap of the Senator's week:           Senator Romney and Senator Murphy (D-CT), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee covering the Middle East, convened a hearing on U.S. policy in Iraq and Lebanon. The hearing focused on the ongoing protests in the region and their implications for U.S. security interests, as well as the recent hold on U.S. military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces. Senator Romney's opening remarks can be viewed below:   The&nbsp;recent protests in Lebanon and Iraq - civilians decrying high unemployment, Iranian intervention, and corruption - have major implications for U.S. national security in the region. The U.S. needs an effective strategy on how to best partner with these nations to advance mutual interests.   Full story by Dennis Romboy here.   China has a comprehensive, rigorous strategy to achieve global domination. At a forum this week, Senator Romney warned of China&#8217;s growing economic aggression, human rights abuses, and military strength - and the need to forge international partnerships to counter these challenges. &#8220;[A]s the leader of the free world, we should lead the development with our allies of a comprehensive strategy designed to convince China that it is in its best interest to change its ambition from dominating the world to instead collaborating and competing in the world,&#8221; he said. The Senator's remarks can be found here.     Senator Romney voted to advance the nomination of Dr. Stephen Hahn to serve as FDA Commissioner out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for full consideration by the full Senate. He did so with reservations, saying:&nbsp;&#8220;Dr. Hahn committed under oath that if he was confirmed, he would use science and data to guide his decisions on the youth vaping crisis. I am counting on him to follow through on that commitment, and I will insist that if confirmed, he will keep this committee and the nation informed about how his decisions are being made. We have a massive public health emergency, with five million kids in high school who are vaping and becoming addicted to nicotine, and we must place the interest of public health above political interest.\"    The Senator also expressed alarm at new data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) revealing that more than 27 percent of high schoolers and 10.5 percent of middle schoolers reported having vaped within the last month:&nbsp;&#8220;The latest data released today by the CDC shows that the vaping crisis is worsening, with more than one quarter of high schoolers and 10.5 percent of middle schoolers reporting they have vaped in the past 30 days. To reverse this deadly trend, the Administration and Congress must act without any more delay to ban flavors that appeal to kids and prevent vaping cartridges from being adulterated with substances that kill. A continued failure to act in the face of this data would be unconscionable.&#8221;    As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Romney joined Sen. Peters (D-MI) on legislation to combat the circulation of opioids, including fentanyl, through the mail saying.&nbsp;The U.S. Postal Service Opioid &amp; Illicit Drug Strategy Act would require the U.S. Postal Service to develop and publish a comprehensive organizational strategy to combat the use of the mail in illicit drug distribution, allowing the agency to identify areas for improvement, enhance coordination across departments, and proactively meet emerging challenges.   Full story by Dennis Romboy and Pat Reavy here.   During a Senate Foreign Relations hearing focused on U.S. policy toward Russia, Senator Mitt Romney&nbsp;stressed&nbsp;the need for the U.S. to develop a comprehensive strategy, instead of just ad hoc sanctions, that diverts Russia from its current path.&nbsp;     In continuation of his&nbsp;efforts to find a solution that compensates student athletes while preserving the integrity of college sports, Senator Romney teamed up with Senators Murphy (D-CT), Rubio (R-FL), Perdue (R-GA), and Booker (D-NJ) to form a bipartisan working group that facilitates these ongoing discussions and evaluate potential solutions.   Full story by Matthew Brooks here.   If we don't act now to address the solvency of programs like Medicare and Social Security, our government's trust funds will be depleted in 13 years. Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, published an op-ed about how Senator Romney's bipartisan, bicameral&nbsp;TRUST Act would put in place a process to rescue these programs that millions of Americans rely on.   Full op-ed by Maya MacGuineas here.   This week, the Senate confirmed David B. Barlow of South Jordan to serve as&nbsp;United States District Judge for the District of Utah. Senators Romney and Lee (R-UT) released the following statement upon his confirmation:&nbsp;&#8220;We have full confidence David will serve Utah and the country with honor and integrity, faithfully applying the law and our Constitution to all matters and parties that come before him. We wish him well as he begins this next chapter of service to our nation as a U.S. District Judge for the District of Utah.&#8221;&nbsp;      Senator Romney met with several groups of Utahns this week, including:   Students from Springville, Green Canyon, Mountain Crest, Ridgeline, and Logan high schools who were in Washington as part of the Close Up program.

It&#8217;s always wonderful to meet with Laura, sign cards, and talk about her commitment to making the holidays brighter for our service men and women. Laura, keep up the great work &#8211; you make New Hampshire proud! Combating Illegal Robocalls  All Americans know what it&#8217;s like to receive countless robocalls &#8211; often multiple times a day. I was glad to vote in favor of bipartisan legislation &#8211; the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act &#8211; this week to help put the American consumer back in control and reduce the frequency of these incessant, disruptive calls. I&#8217;m pleased the House and Senate came together in a bipartisan way to pass this commonsense and much-needed bill, and I urge the President to swiftly sign it into law. Standing Up for Critical Nutrition Assistance   The Trump Administration&#8217;s announcement that it will end nutrition assistance for approximately 700,000 Americans demonstrates a clear lack of care and concern for people who are struggling to put food on the table. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress rejected these cuts to the SNAP program last year. The Administration&#8217;s rule recklessly casts people from the program without considering what economic, geographic, health, and other factors may contribute to their needing food assistance. I hope that the President will re-think this unnecessary and cruel decision. Getting PFAS Chemicals Out of Cosmetics   It was great to join my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues on Wednesday to hear from administration officials, cosmetic industry professionals, and environmental experts to explore how we can empower the Food and Drug Administration to ensure all cosmetic and personal care products are safe.   Despite our progress in New Hampshire to get PFAS chemicals out of our backyards, PFAS is present in many cosmetic and personal care products. From makeup to shampoo, Americans deserve products free from these harmful chemicals. I look forward to the work ahead to protect communities in the Granite State and across the nation from PFAS.       Speaking out against PFAS chemicals in cosmetics. Watch here.    Ensuring New Hampshire Workers are Treated Fairly  While it&#8217;s encouraging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has heeded my request to return to the bargaining table and have a fair and open discussion with American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union representatives, the EPA should have come to this decision sooner. These union representatives are following in the footsteps of previous generations of union members who fought tirelessly for basic fairness and justice on the job, and they deserve a fair negotiation process.  I&#8217;ll be monitoring this situation in the hopes that an acceptable contract will be agreed upon in a timely manner. I will continue to stand up for the hard-working men and women in New Hampshire and I&#8217;ll keep working to ensure that workers nationwide are treated fairly and with respect. Building a Clean Economy   The Granite State is home to some of our nation&#8217;s most pristine, breathtaking lands, and we must act to protect them for future generations. I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing the 100% Clean Economy Act &#8211; a critical step to combat climate change, improve public health, and strengthen our economy with green jobs. The time to act on climate is now. I look forward to my continued work to protect all that makes New Hampshire such a special place to call home.  A Somber but Necessary Step   This week, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House will begin to draft articles of impeachment. I believe this is a somber but necessary moment for our democracy and to protect our national security. We are taking this one step at a time, and when the House Judiciary Committee advances articles of impeachment, I will evaluate each on its individual merits and content.  The House Intelligence Committee&#8217;s report on the impeachment inquiry uncovered substantial and uncontested evidence that President Trump abused the power of the presidency to solicit foreign interference in our election for his own political gain. Every American should have an opportunity to assess the facts and draw conclusions from the evidence. I encourage you to examine the evidence and reach out to my office with your thoughts.  Giving Back to the Community        At the Friendly Kitchen    It was wonderful to join my husband Brad, members of my staff and local volunteers to serve lunch at The Friendly Kitchen in Concord on Monday- thank you Chef Carl and Val for hosting us! Giving back to others is what the holiday season is all about.   Honoring Bill Luti &#8211; a Granite State Role Model   Like so many Granite Staters, I am looking back fondly on the life of Bill Luti, who passed away last week at the age of 98. Bill coached cross country and track for decades at Concord High School and inspired countless young people to challenge themselves and live up to their potential. He was also a role model for young women, having started Concord High&#8217;s girls&#8217; track and field program in the 1970s, when girls&#8217; participation in sports was not taken as seriously as it is today. My thoughts are with Bill&#8217;s family and friends at this time &#8211; his kind and generous spirit will be long remembered.   Here for You&nbsp;  I encourage you to continue reaching out to me with any questions, concerns or ideas you have &#8211; I love hearing from Granite Staters!

It is truly an honor to represent you and your families in our nation's capital, and as we head into the final weeks of 2019, I encourage you and all of our fellow West Texans to&nbsp;follow me on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and like my page on&nbsp;Facebook to get the latest updates on our work to restore power back to We the People.  Military Family Month  During Military Family Month in November, I highlighted the families of two local military heroes at Dyess Air Force Base.&nbsp;At the change of command ceremony earlier this year, outgoing Base Commander Col. Brandon Parker had a surprise for his family. As a reward for always being strong and rolling with the punches that come with being a military family that moves every few years to new places, he announced that he's taking them to Disney World - a well deserved treat!    Filling his shoes, Dyess&#8217; new Base Commander Col. Ed Sumangil is excited to be back in Abilene, where he was married and two of his children were born.    Every month, we're grateful for the spouses, children, and loved ones who serve alongside our troops.  Passing USMCA, Delivering A Win For America  The new and much-improved North American trade deal, USMCA, is being held up by House Democrat leadership who are more concerned with playing political games than adding over 176,000 new jobs and $70 billion to our nation's economy. Despite the assurances they have been provided to address concerns about enforcing labor and environmental standards, Democrats are continuing to move the goal posts and put partisan politics over prosperity as they delay passage of USMCA to focus on their impeachment inquisition of President Trump.  Click here or on the image below to watch my conversation on Fox Business Network about the prospects of passing USMCA before the end of 2019:    Standing Up For West Texas Beef Producers  When I'm home in West Texas, the cows tell me how bad the Green New Deal is.  While that is a joke, the radical proposals promoted by Democrats are a serious threat to our agriculture and energy economies in the American heartland. That's why I was proud to stand up for Texas beef producers in a recent Trade Subcommittee hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee.  Click here or on the image below to watch my full remarks:    National Meat Judging Champions!  Speaking of beef, last month the Texas Tech University Meat Judging team took home their&nbsp;14th national championship title - an all-time record!&nbsp;With Texas boasting more heads of cattle than 43 states have people, it comes as no surprise that these outstanding Techsans know their meat!

That's why I introduced the Accountable Care In Rural America Act before the Thanksgiving holiday to change the incentives of our health care system to reward quality over quantity while reducing the cost to taxpayers over time. I am confident that this bill will empower rural health care providers, reduce costs to both patients and taxpayers, and strengthen the health and well-being of our families living in America's breadbasket and energy basis.

Home to artists like Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings, and the Josh Abbott Band,&nbsp;District 19 has a rich history of musical greatness, and we are extremely proud that Tanya will be flying the West Texas flag at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in January!    Bidding Farewell to a Fellow West Texan  Last week I joined my fellow Texans to honor the outstanding career of our fellow West Texan, outgoing Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. Wrapping up a lifetime of public service, including as the longest-serving Texas governor in our state's history, Secretary Perry is leaving behind an incredible legacy for American energy dominance.  I'm proud to call Secretary Perry my friend and know that America is better because of his leadership.

On Good Friday, April 9, 2004, Matthew was wounded during one of the worst convoy ambushes of the entire Iraq War, but he never received the appropriate recognition for his sacrifice. I was proud to work with the&nbsp;Veterans Assistance Commission of Peoria County&nbsp;to ensure he received the proper commendation for his sacrifice. This week, I had the distinct honor of presenting him with the Purple Heart Medal and the Army Commendation Medal with Valor that he earned serving our country. It&#8217;s because of men and women like Matthew that we live in the greatest country on earth. We can never forget their sacrifice. A special thanks to Matthew&#8217;s family, the Peoria County VAC, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart for their tireless work and support for our veterans.

This investment is phenomenal news for Quincy and will strengthen our infrastructure system in west-central Illinois. The&nbsp;Quincy Regional Airport&nbsp;plays an important role in connecting the Tri-State area with the rest of the country and this funding will ensure they have sound infrastructure for years to come.

I applaud Bishop Daniel Jenky and Archbishop Fulton Sheen&#8217;s family for their incredible efforts to see his body returned to Saint Mary&#8217;s Cathedral, and I am grateful to His Holiness Pope Francis for approving Sheen&#8217;s beatification.

At a Senate Homeland Security subcommittee hearing, Senator Romney warned that China is exploiting American research institutions to steal U.S. intellectual property - threatening our national security. The Senate also unanimously passed legislation to support the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. At the Senate confirmation hearing for the next FDA Commissioner, Senator Romney continued advocating for a vaping flavor ban to protect our country's youth from nicotine addiction. The Senator subsequently took his plan for addressing the youth vaping epidemic to the White House for a meeting with the President, industry representatives, and health experts. A brief recap of the Senator's week can be found below:           At the Senate confirmation hearing for Dr. Stephen Hahn to serve as the next FDA Commissioner, Senator Romney urged him to put public health ahead of politics in taking action to address the vaping epidemic.   Following the hearing, Senator Romney issued the following statement: \"While I appreciate that Dr. Hahn agrees that bold action is needed to reduce youth vaping, I believe he should have affirmed the need for a flavor ban based on the evidence seen so far, which is that flavored e-cigarettes are drawing more and more kids into vaping and they are becoming addicted to nicotine without knowing it. We have a health emergency on our hands, and the Administration must follow through on its commitment to ban flavors that entice our youth.\"    Full story by Dan Harrie here.   Senator Romney convened&nbsp;Utah collegiate athletic directors for a discussion on how to compensate student athletes. The mutual concern: how to preserve the integrity of collegiate sports. The Senator pledged to keep working hand in hand with this group and the NCAAon a solution that achieves both.   Senator Romney wants to make sure that the college athletes of today, and the athletes in the future, don't have to sacrifice their time and their bodies without being fairly compensated.   Full story by Dennis Romboy&nbsp;here.   This week, the Senate unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to show support for the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. Senator Romney said: \"These protests are further exposing China&#8217;s relentless campaign of repression and censorship and remind us of how precious freedom truly is.\"  At a Senate Homeland Security subcommittee hearing, Senator Romney warned that China is increasingly exploiting American&nbsp;research institutions and universities to steal U.S. intellectual property, which means American taxpayers are funding China's quest for world dominance.   The Senator called on Congress to work with American universities and research institutions, the State Department, and the FBI to develop a comprehensive strategy to identify and respond to China's Thousand Talents Plan and similar threats from other adversaries.   Full story by Brendan Bordelon here.   Senator Romney this week voted against a stop-gap government spending bill this week, saying:&nbsp;&#8220;I promised the people of Utah I would vote against these kinds of last-minute, short-term spending bills. We passed a bill like this in September, and here we are again, and in four more weeks will do this all over again. This is no way to govern. The longer Congress continues to rubber-stamp spending bills without addressing the drivers of our debt, the worse our country&#8217;s fiscal challenges get. That is why I voted against this spending bill.&#8221;&nbsp;    While the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency&nbsp;Watershed Protection Program is an important tool, state and local partners across Utah have faced hurdles when trying to access these funds for wildfire recovery. Senator Romney teamed up with Senator Bennet (D-CO) to call on the Government Accountability Office to conduct a&nbsp;review of this program:   Full story by Connor Richards here.   Senator Romney met with Tibetan President Dr. Lobsang Sangay to discuss the Tibetan people's pursuit of genuine autonomy from the Chinese regime. They also discussed similar pursuits of the people of Hong Kong, Inner Mongolia, Taiwan, and the Uighurs.     The Senator also met with Utahns in Washington, including:   Utah County Clerk Amelia Powers and her elections staff who were in town to receive an award for their work coordinating elections.

This week, Senator Ernst, a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, proposed a bipartisan bill to modernize the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to ensure married couples who work for the same employer are not restricted in the amount of leave they can take under the law, an issue in the original law that&#8217;s become increasingly evident in the modern workforce. The FAIR Leave Act&#151;or Fair Access for Individuals to Receive Leave Act&#151;modernizes the FMLA by extending equal benefits to married couples regardless of their employer, and also provides time to care for a sick family member, including our heroic servicemembers.  Fighting to Improve Transparency and Accountability in the Olympic Community  Building on her efforts to tackle the heartbreaking abuses seen within the U.S. Olympic system, Senator Ernst partnered with her fellow Iowan, Senator Chuck Grassley, in putting forward a bipartisan bill to ensure the resources designated for investigating abuses of Olympic and amateur athletes are safeguarded and put to proper use. The U.S. Olympic Committee has shown a willingness to make necessary reforms to prevent these abuses in the future and this legislation supports that effort. Senator Ernst&#8217;s bill will increase oversight and accountability, begin necessary steps to prevent all forms of abuse, and will help in moving us down the long road to rebuilding trust within our country&#8217;s Olympic community.  The legislation, called the SAFESPORT Act&#151;or the Stopping Abuse from Entering Sports, Promoting Oversight, Responsibility and Transparency Act&#151;was included as amendments to a larger bill, the Empowering Olympic and Amateur Athletes Act that was approved Wednesday by the Senate Commerce Committee.  Working to Ensure Survivors Get the Resources and Support They Need  For months, Senator Ernst has been working in good faith with Democrats, like Senator Dianne Feinstein, to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Last week, after months of bipartisan work and progress, talks came to an end because &#8220;Democrats cannot afford to be seen as giving Republicans a win.&#8221;  Senator Ernst spoke on the Senate floor to call out Democrats for putting politics before sexual assault and domestic abuse survivors.

Senator Ernst stated that she remains committed to making sure survivors get the resources and support they need, and she stands ready to work in a bipartisan way to find a pathway forward for a bipartisan reauthorization of VAWA Meeting in the Oval Office on US-Turkey Relations&nbsp;  Senator Ernst, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined President Trump at the White House for a meeting with President Erdogan of Turkey to voice her concerns about President Erdogan&#8217;s decision to choose Russia&#8217;s S-400 as its missile system and her support for the Kurds. Continuing to Press EPA to Uphold the RFS  On behalf of Iowa&#8217;s farmers and biofuels producers, Senator Ernst continues to press the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to restore the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). This week, Senator Ernst, along with a group of Midwest senators, renewed her recommendations to the Trump Administration with respect to the EPA&#8217;s proposed RFS supplemental rule. In a letter sent yesterday, which enclosed her initial comments to EPA from last week, Senator Ernst and her colleagues urged the administration to take corrective action in its RFS rulemaking to uphold the agreement they reached with President Trump at their September 12, 2019 White House meeting.

In the wake of recent NCAA eligibility issues, like the one involving James Wiseman at the University of Memphis, and sexual abuse coverups, and calls for student&nbsp;athletes to benefit financially from their success, it&#8217;s clear that issues involving college sports will come before Congress. See my release on the Caucus here.&nbsp;  Questioning Amtrak CEO&#8217;s Commitment to Customer Service&nbsp;   More than 11 years ago, then-Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson testified before the House Judiciary Committee and, under questioning by me, promised that Memphis International Airport would retain its hub status and that our non-stop flight to Amsterdam would continue. I was&nbsp;skeptical at the&nbsp;time and&nbsp;was,&nbsp;unfortunately,&nbsp;proven right when&nbsp;neither promise was kept. So when Anderson, now CEO of Amtrak, came before the Transportation and Infrastructure&nbsp;Committee Wednesday, I told him frankly that I doubted his commitment to customer service and disagreed with his decision to do away with Amtrak&#8217;s traditional dining service.

Once back in Washington, the Senator continued advocating for Congress to address the vaping epidemic at a Senate Health Committee hearing on the topic with officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Senator Romney also participated in the nomination hearing for FEMA Administrator, where he brought up concerns related to wildfire prevention and recovery efforts, and met with several groups of Utahns. A brief recap of his week can be found below.         &nbsp;     We owe a debt of gratitude to each of our veterans for their service and sacrifice on behalf of our country. Senator Romney recorded the below video message for Veterans Day to express his appreciation to our nation's veterans.   On Veterans Day, Senator Romney participated in the University of Utah's Veterans Day Commemoration where 11 Utahns were honored. Information on this year's honorees can be found here.   Senator Romney participated in an Honor Flight send-off for a group of Utah veterans in Salt Lake City. The Honor Flight Network is an organization that transports our nation's veterans to Washington, D.C. to visit and reflect at the memorials.&nbsp;    The rate of vaping-related illness in Utah is 6x the national average. In addition, our country now has more than five million young people addicted to nicotine. At a Senate Health Committee hearing examining the response to vaping-related lung illness, Senator Romney urged the FDA and CDC to work with Congress to address this epidemic. He also detailed his legislation, the ENND Act, which representatives from both agencies agreed would benefit the public.     Full story by Dennis Romboy here.   Senator Romney met with NCAA President Mark Emmert to express his views on the need for student athlete compensation. The Senator will continue working with the NCAA and with advocates to find a solution that compensates student athletes while preserving the integrity of collegiate sports.      At a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on the nomination of Peter Gaynor to serve as FEMA Administrator, Senator Romney spoke about the importance of FEMA stepping in to provide resources to prevent the wildfires from getting out of control. The Senator also spoke about the need to apply private sector thinking to the Federal Flood Insurance program.      The&nbsp;U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP), is an important tool to help Western states recover from wildfires. However, state and local partners across Utah have faced hurdles when trying to access these funds. Senators Romney and Bennet (D-CO) called on the Government Accountability Office to review the EWP so it effectively serves communities across the West as they recover from devastating wildfires. The letter can be found here.   As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Romney met with Jovita Carranza, nominee to serve as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, prior to her nomination hearing.     Senator Romney met with several groups of Utahns this week in Washington, including:   Bonnie Hilton of Herriman, Utah's 2019 Angel in Adoption honoree.   Julie Fullmer, the Mayor of Vineyard.

As chairman of the Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee, our veterans have been my daily inspiration, and it has been my mission to ensure we fulfill our promises to them and to their family members.  On Wednesday evening, the Senate Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs hosted a Veterans Appreciation Reception in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard to recognize members of Congress and staff who served in our armed forces and continue to support our service members and veterans. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve our veterans as chairman, and the opportunity to reflect on all we have accomplished on behalf of those who have served was really special.&nbsp;    Getting the Job Done The Atlanta Regional Commission recently honored me for a lifetime of public service and lasting impact on the region as well as on our state.  Throughout my career, I&#8217;ve done my best to put my three decades of real estate experience to use to promote policies in all levels of government that allow our economy to thrive and to ensure that Georgia remains the economic and cultural capital of the Southeast.  This week, the Atlanta Business Chronicle ran an article covering my entry into public service as businessman and an active member of my neighborhood. I&#8217;ve been proud to look out for the interests of my community, our state and our nation.  In Other News  The Senate passed a resolution that Senator Jon Tester, D-Mont., and I introduced allowing the Senate to collect charitable contributions as part of this year&#8217;s Toys for Tots drive. This annual tradition we host in coordination with the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve will help brighten the holiday season for children in need. The Senate will begin collections on Dec. 4, and I salute the efforts of all those involved in this wonderful cause.   We are working to honor the heroes of World War II &#8220;Merrill&#8217;s Marauders&#8221; unit with the Congressional Gold Medal for their extraordinary efforts and sacrifices. I introduced legislation to recognize this elite group of volunteer warriors, and after having more than two-thirds of the Senate endorse this measure, I&#8217;m glad we are one step closer to awarding them with the Congressional Gold Medal.   I had the opportunity to speak with students at Alpharetta High School and Notre Dame Academy in Duluth this week. I have always enjoyed the opportunity to talk with Georgia students and reinforce that democracy is a participatory sport. It requires all of us to be engaged, and public servants should be accessible to constituents of all ages.   The Sunday after Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous driving times of the year. This year, I&#8217;ve again introduced a Senate resolution with Senators David Perdue and Chris Coons, D-Del., to spread awareness and promote safe travel on our nation&#8217;s roadways during the holiday season.

Statehood&#8217; Rally, Receives Award Congresswoman Norton spoke at a rally sponsored by Veterans for D.C. Statehood on Veterans Day in Freedom Plaza.&nbsp; Norton accepted the &#8220;DC Statehood Freedom Award&#8221; for her work fighting for D.C. equality. &#8220;Residents&nbsp;of this place we now call the nation&#8217;s capital fought in the Revolutionary War that created the United States of America,&#8221; Norton said.&nbsp; &#8220;Yet for 218 years, our veterans have lived as unequal citizens in their nation&#8217;s capital, despite fighting in every U.S. war, bringing equal rights throughout the world.&nbsp; On Veterans Day, we remember that no Americans have given more to their country or received less than veterans from the District of Columbia.&#8221; Norton&#8217;s D.C. statehood bill (H.R. 51) has 223 cosponsors in the House. The companion bill in the Senate (S. 631), introduced by Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), has 35 Senate cosponsors.   Before Veterans Day Weekend, Norton Introduces Veterans Legal Support Act Congresswoman Norton introduced the Veterans Legal Support Act of 2019, which would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide financial support to law school clinical programs that provide pro bono legal services to veterans, including assistance with disability claims and foreclosures.&nbsp; There are at least 22 law schools that have clinics devoted to veterans&#8217; legal needs, including the William &amp; Mary Law School Veterans Benefits Clinic, which serves as a national model for this idea and was the first recipient of a &#8220;best practice&#8221; certification from the VA.&nbsp; There are many other law schools, such as the University of the District of Columbia&#8217;s David A. Clarke School of Law, that are interested in starting their own VA-certified clinics. In her introductory statement, Norton wrote: &#8220;More than 400,000 veterans are waiting for their disability claims to be processed by the VA.&nbsp; With the assistance of lawyers and law professors, clinical programs provide free legal resources to assist veterans in processing their claims.&nbsp; My bill would merely build on what some law schools have begun to do for the last several years.&nbsp; More needs to be done to sustain and increase these programs.&#8221;   Norton Introduces Congressional Record Statement Honoring Firefighter Alex Graham Congresswoman Norton introduced a congressional record statement remembering and honoring the life of District of Columbia firefighter Alex Graham, who died after suffering a heart attack while on duty.&nbsp; Graham was named the 2018 D.C. Firefighter of the Year for his decades of service to the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. In her statement, Norton wrote: &#8220;He was a humble and dedicated public servant and technician.&nbsp; As a firefighter with Engine 21 in Adams Morgan, known as the Alley Rats, he worked to protect the lives of D.C. residents.&nbsp; Graham was known to go above and beyond, ensuring that fire station equipment was top grade.&nbsp; He meticulously worked behind the scenes, researching equipment issues and fixing them, which at times meant traveling from firehouse to firehouse restringing 500 ladders.&#8221; Read the full statement here.   Norton Celebrates Unanimous Senate Passage of Resolution Honoring Nationals World Series Win Congresswoman Norton celebrated the unanimous passage of a resolution in the Senate honoring the Washington Nationals for winning the first World Series in franchise history.&nbsp; The Nationals beat the Houston Astros in seven games, winning all four road games. &#8220;In one word &#150; history!&#8221;&nbsp;Norton said.&nbsp; &#8220;Congratulations to the Washington Nationals on this achievement and thank you to all the coaches, players, trainers, and especially fans who believed in our underdog team.&nbsp; Whether it&#8217;s the Capitals, the Mystics, or the Nationals &#150; or the historic momentum for D.C. statehood &#150; the District has been on a roll lately and has established itself as a true big-time sports city.&#8221; Norton introduced the companion bill in the House.

Honoring Our Nation&#8217;s Veterans Recognizing Veterans Day As we come together as a nation to recognize Veterans Day, we honor the incredible sacrifices men and women in uniform have made on behalf of our nation and for our freedom. America has been made exceptional by the enduring courage and bravery of our troops who have waged war against our adversaries so that our country and world could remain more peaceful. We also are called today to rededicate ourselves to make certain that veterans are treated with the care and respect they deserve following their service to our nation, and I hope we all take time to reflect on the profound impact of our servicemembers, past and present. To all those who have served our country: thank you, we respect you and we love you. To watch a video message to our nation&#8217;s veterans, click&nbsp;here.   Discussing our Work to Support Veterans at the Washington Post I joined my colleague, Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.), this week for a Washington Post Live event, Veterans in America. During the event, Sen. Tester and I discussed issues facing our nation&#8217;s veterans as we recognize their service this Veterans Day. We primarily discussed mental health, suicide prevention and the importance of providing access to timely and quality healthcare to our heroes who deserve the best our nation has to offer.&nbsp;As Members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. Tester and I introduced the&nbsp;Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act&nbsp;to address the increasing demand for access to mental healthcare and various resources that can saves lives. Sen. Tester and I also discussed the merits of this legislation on the live panel, which is named after a decorated Navy SEAL who lost his battle to PTSD in 2018. Our legislation would expand access to care for rural veterans using telemedicine, invest in non-VA organizations and healthcare programs, offer non-traditional mental health treatments like agritherapy, make investments in gender-specific services, and ease the transition of servicemembers into civilian life.&nbsp;We also discussed the&nbsp;VA MISSION Act&nbsp;and how implementation that follows the intent of Congress will help veterans across the country access care through the VA and in the community. This landmark legislation improves access to community care for veterans and streamlines the cumbersome requirements that previously limited community care and the ability of veterans to receive quality healthcare close to home. Allowing Kansan veterans, especially rural veterans across the country, to seek care in the comfort of their community will improve the physical and mental well-being of those who selflessly served our country.    Chairing a Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee Hearing On Wednesday, I chaired a Senate Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee hearing that considered two nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans&#8217; Claims. This Court was established in 1988 to review decisions made by the Board of Veterans&#8217; Appeals to make certain veterans receive the care and benefits they rightfully deserve. Just last year, the Court received 6,802 cases and decided 4,842 appeals. This caseload highlights the importance of the Court and the impact its decisions have on veterans across the country. The two nominees, Scott Laurer and Grant Jaquith, have accomplished legal and military careers and will serve veterans to the best of their ability once confirmed.    Recognizing Veterans Day at the Manhattan American Legion On Monday, I joined members of the Pearce-Keller Post No. 17 of the American Legion and the Luckey Assembly Knights of Columbus in Manhattan to recognize Veterans Day. During the breakfast, it was an honor to speak to so many veterans from the across Manhattan whose dedicated service to our nation lives on through their service to the American Legion and a number of community organizations. Thank you to all those who organized the breakfast and for their continued work to honor and support our nation&#8217;s heroes.   &nbsp;Announcing BUILD Grants for Infrastructure Improvements in Olathe and Ellis County Earlier this week, I was pleased to announce that a total of $16.5 million in BUILD grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation were awarded to entities in Kansas. This funding will go toward two vitally important infrastructure projects in Ellis County and Olathe, Kansas.&nbsp;Ellis County Through the BUILD Grant program, $6.5 million was provided to Ellis County for new resources to improve the Northwest Business Corridor. The resources provided in this grant will allow for increased economic development in the region and help existing businesses expand through improved infrastructure. The current roadway that is the Northwest Business Corridor was not designed for the volume or type of traffic driven by recent private-sector investment, and improvements along the corridor will help promote economic activity now and long into the future. Additionally, it will improve safety for travelers who take the corridor and increase access to businesses along the route. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read more on this award.&nbsp;Olathe The $10 million in funding was provided to the City of Olathe for the expansion and improvement of the I-35 and 119th Street interchange, otherwise known as the Interstate 35 and 119th Street Interchange Reconfiguration Project. One of the highest traffic volume intersections in the state, this area serves as the spine for KC&#8217;s Gateway District and the completion of these improvements will allow residents and travelers to safely and more effectively access jobs, businesses and amenities in the area.

Speaking with Incoming Wichita State President Dr. Jay Golden On Monday, Dr. Jay Golden was named the next President of Wichita State University by the Kansas Board of Regents. Dr. Golden&#8217;s background in developing partnerships between higher education and the private sector, as well as his experience growing universities, will serve Wichita State, Wichita State students and the entire region well. I look forward to work in partnership with Dr. Golden and to continue making progress on important issues facing the community.    Speaking at the KU Cancer Center&#8217;s 2019 Research Symposium This week, I joined researchers from the University of Kansas Cancer Center for the Center&#8217;s 2019 Research Symposium, and had the opportunity to offer remarks in support of their work which carries significant life-saving potential. In my remarks I underscored the importance of the research conducted at the KU Cancer Center, and how their work fits into, and furthers, a larger collaborative effort to defeat cancer. My efforts to increase resources available for the National Institutes of Health through the Senate Appropriations Committee is driven in large part by the progress being made at the KU Cancer Center and similar academic research institutions across the country. In addition, Dr. Jensen presented me with the 2019 KU Cancer Center Director's Legislator of the Year award. Thanks, Dr. Jensen, for this special recognition and for our close partnership in our work to advance medical research in the region. Robba and I are grateful for your continued friendship.&nbsp;I appreciate Dr. Roy Jensen, Director of the KU Cancer Center for inviting me to speak at the Symposium, and Dr. Christopher Austin, Director of NIH&#8217;s National Cancer Center for Advancing Translational Sciences for addressing the symposium. I will continue to be a strong advocate for NIH to ensure that it, and its partners like the KU Cancer Center, receive the resources necessary to continue to make strides in cancer research in a timely manner.    Meeting with the Kansas Air National Guard On Wednesday, I met with Airmen from the 190th Air Refueling Wing, a Kansas Air National Guard unit based out of Topeka, Kansas. These &#8220;Outstanding Airmen&#8221; were chosen by their chain of command to travel to our nation&#8217;s capital to attend leadership development training and meet with national security and defense policy leaders.&nbsp;These Kansas Airmen shared their work promoting mental health and suicide prevention within their units. We discussed the importance of providing a support system for our friends and colleagues who might be dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression. Suicide, especially by veterans and servicemembers, has become a national crisis so I was pleased to hear that the 190th AWR used a drill weekend to bring its Airmen together and attend the leadership development training in D.C.    Spending Time with Kansas City Area Aviation Leaders FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center On Friday, I spent time at the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center in Olathe. During the tour, I heard about the operations of the facility and the work that the controllers do to get over 6,000 flights safely across our region every day. During our meeting, we discussed the detrimental impacts of a government shutdown on both the center&#8217;s operations, and on their work to train air traffic controllers. I was pleased to hear their support for my legislation, the&nbsp;Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2019, which would prevent future shutdowns from damaging this vital industry. Thanks to National Air Traffic Controllers Association local leaders Todd Mariani, Nathan Burch and Jami Davis for their informative tour, and to FAA Air Traffic Manager Christina Calvert for her leadership of the facility.    Collins Aerospace Following my time at the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center, I was in Lenexa to tour Collins Aerospace. Collins is engaged in designing, manufacturing and servicing a multitude of systems and components for commercial, business and military aircraft. The men and women of their Lenexa facility produce aircraft oxygen systems and in-air beverage products, serving as a critical link in the aviation supply chain. Thanks to the many employees for taking time out of their day for the tour and for their productive conversation. Thank you also to Collins Aerospace General Manager JP Foulon and General Manager of Beverage Products Sabastian Ramus for their tour.    Meeting with Members of the Lenexa Chamber of Commerce  On Thursday evening, following my return to Kansas from Washington, D.C., I was in Lenexa to attend the Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s &#8216;After Hours&#8217; event that brings members together on a regular basis. During the event, I was pleased to visit with folks and discuss our work in the Senate, as well as recent developments happening in Lenexa and across Johnson County.    Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

Like many of you, I remember arriving to bootcamp. I would be sitting on my rack after a long day in our ship  shaved head, wearing those ugly navy dungarees, waiting for the mail petty officer to call out my name. The highlight of the day was receiving letters from home in the mail. I would get letters from family and friends from my small town. These letters expressed support for me... letters making sure that I knew people back home cared  not only about me, but they cared about what I was doing, and they were proud that I was serving my country, how I was one of their native sons. It was these letters and those people whom I thought about through tough times at bootcamp; these letters and those people who I thought about through tough times in Hell week and SEAL training; these letters and those people I thought about through tough times overseas. I think about them today. That is one of the reasons I am so proud to call myself a Virginian, surrounded by the kind of people in my letters all those years ago. The type of people who wrote the letters, the type of people who received the letters. These are the types of people who call Virginia home. I feel that the same profound sense of duty that I felt to those family and friends years ago who counted on me. When something happens in the world, and mother freedom needs to be defended, it is our men and women who go forward to the sound of the fight. It is our families who pick up the slack and shoulder the nations burden of sacrifice and service; it is our neighbors who pitch in to help with the kids or the yard work or coach sports teams. And you veterans, you have put in your time, your treasure, and some of youyour blood. Our elected government of the people, God willing, shall never forget what you have done for both the history and the future of these United States. For if they ever do forget, we will cease to be the overwhelming force for good on this globe. And the American patriot sheep dogs would be replaced by authoritarism, dictatorship, and the loss of the free man. As veterans, you may forever and eternally take your place amongst those honorable patriots who have stepped forward, whether voluntarily or drafted, with youth and rigor and bravery for your nation, for your family, and for the soldier on your left and right. On this day, we bestow honor upon you, because you once took the watch for us, for this nation, and we thank you. May God lift you up and may he always bless these United States. Happy Veterans Day!

Here are my top 5 tips for selecting a Medicare Advantage Plan: 1. Consider a plan&#8217;s Star Rating. This measures how well Medicare Advantage and Part D plans perform based on customer service and quality of care. 2. If you rely on any prescription drug, check the drug plan to see if your drugs are on that list. 3. Make sure the plan covers nearby hospitals and other health care providers you rely on. 4. Look at the costs as a whole. Make sure you consider total drug costs, premiums, deductibles, and other costs to see if it fits in your budget. 5. If you have a chronic condition, look at how well the plan manages that condition by reviewing their coverage rules like prior authorization and step therapy. Also, a reminder my office&#8217;s next Medicare tele-town hall will be Wednesday, November 13th at 10:00 a.m. Medicare beneficiaries can speak directly with Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services officials about their Medicare plans and questions. The call-in phone number will be:Dial-in Number: 877-229-8493PIN: 116489  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;      BUILD Grants coming to Hays Infrastructure is vital to the economic prosperity of so many communities in Kansas. From roads to bridges, broadband and water, all systems must function for communities to thrive. This week, Ellis County was notified they've received a $6.5 million BUILD grant from the United States Department of Transportation for the reconstruction of four miles of road north of Hays and an extension of the existing US 183 Bypass around the City of Hays. Earlier this year, I toured the&nbsp;businesses impacted by this investment and saw first-hand the need for improvements in the city's roadways.&nbsp; This project received local, state, and federal support and will have a positive impact on Ellis County, Hays, and multiple employers.    Financial Services Summit Earlier this week, I had the pleasure to be part of a panel discussion on the growth and competitiveness of Kansas over the next decade at the Kansas Financial Services Summit hosted by&nbsp;Security Benefit. I joined Kansas Secretary of Commerce David Toland and Kansas Chamber of Commerce President Alan Cobb to highlight both what is working and what we all can do to improve the future of the state.  Kansas has so many unique and valuable assets and opportunities and it&#8217;s my job to remove regulatory burdens, keep taxes low, and improve the economic environment to make education and good-paying jobs attainable for all Kansans.    Animal Health HEALTH WEEK isn't just about human health, Kansas has become a leader in animal health and nutrition, and&nbsp;Merck Animal Health&nbsp;is one of the many companies working to develop more animal health products for livestock and household pets. Merck, located in DeSoto, Kansas, sits in the heart of the Animal Health Corridor and manufactures vaccines for livestock that are used both in the U.S. and in 47 countries around the world. Protecting the health of our animals is vital to creating a safe, secure, and affordable food system.   Fixing Hours of Service Regulations Hours of Service regulations continue to impact livestock haulers across the country, including right here in Kansas. These regulations lack the flexibility needed to address the unique challenges posed by transporting agricultural commodities, and are often misunderstood or inconsistently enforced.&nbsp; To help our Kansas producers ensure animal health and welfare during transport while also ensuring motorist safety, I recently co-sponsored H.R. 4919, The Responsible and Efficient Agriculture Destination (TREAD) Act. This bill provides for an additional 150 air-mile exemption from these regulations on the back-end of agricultural commodity hauls, and would allow for year-round use of these exemptions. It&#8217;s a commonsense step providing the flexibility needed for producers and haulers alike. &nbsp;   President's Award for Distinguished Service I was proud to receive the&nbsp;American College of Cardiology&#8217;s (ACC) 2019 President&#8217;s Award for Distinguished Public Service. ACC represents over 52,000 cardiovascular health care professionals across the country and they advocate on policies that improve patient access to care, promote heart health, and decrease administrative burdens in the health system. ACC selected me for this award because of my efforts on advocating for innovation and transparency in the health system and my successfully led regulatory initiatives with the Trump Administration. They also highlighted my contribution in advancing legislation that would streamline prior authorization in the Medicare Advantage program. I&#8217;m humbled to receive this award. Every health care initiative I take on, I put patients first, and strive to deliver fair and meaningful solutions.    Improving Rural Infrastructure Last Friday, the&nbsp;U.S. Department of Agriculture&nbsp;announced a $1.4 billion investment in projects to build and improve rural electric infrastructure that will benefit 1.5 million residents and businesses across the country. Specifically, in the First District,&nbsp;Western Cooperative Electric Assn., Inc.&nbsp;in Wakeeney will receive $19 million to build and improve 135 miles of line that will enhance system resilience and reliability for over 500 customers. Additionally,&nbsp;Ark Valley Electric Cooperative&nbsp;in South Hutchinson will receive $5.7 million to build and improve miles of line that support hundreds of Kansans.

Planners are calling the eight-mile route, which will include the construction of 28 new transit stations, the &#8220;Innovation Corridor.&#8221;&nbsp;See my release about this major, transformative transit news here.&nbsp;  Seeking Answers from Governor Lee about Unspent Funding for&nbsp;Low-Income&nbsp;Families&nbsp;  Also Wednesday, I wrote to Governor Bill Lee with questions about why Tennessee &#150; the 10th&nbsp;poorest state in the nation &#150;&nbsp;has not spent&nbsp;hundreds of millions of federal dollars&nbsp;allocated through&nbsp;the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program&nbsp;to help low-income families. Tennessee is the only state in the nation to accumulate an estimated $700 million dollar TANF reserve. This is a big deal to struggling Tennesseans, and the funds should be immediately dispersed in bold ways to assist families in need. See my release containing the letter here.&nbsp;  Calling Attention to Open Enrollment for Affordable Care Act Health Coverage&nbsp;  Open Enrollment for 2020 Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance coverage began last Friday, November 1, and ends December 15, which is closer than you might think. The Trump&nbsp;Administration reduced the open enrollment period by six weeks after taking office and is keeping that limited window of opportunity again this year. I have scheduled a &#8220;Congress On Your Corner&#8221; for Friday, November 22, at the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library, 3030 Poplar Avenue, so that my District Office staff and an ACA &#8220;navigator&#8221; can help with the process, as well as with questions about other federal agencies and programs. See more details about the upcoming Congress on Your Corner here.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Questioning Tactics and Goals of Recent Immigration Raids&nbsp;    On Thursday, I drove to&nbsp;Tougaloo&nbsp;College in Jackson, Mississippi, to attend a Committee on Homeland Security field hearing on recent immigration raids. My friend Congressman Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, Chairman of the Committee, presided over an examination of the August 7 raids at seven poultry processing plants, the largest one-state immigration raid in American history. I asked about the Trump Administration&#8217;s enforcement policies that ignore existing guidance on minimizing the impact of these raids on American communities. See my release about the hearing here.  Expressing Concern about Revelations from the Trump Impeachment Inquiry&nbsp;  Despite&nbsp;Trump&#8217;s&nbsp;inner circle&#8217;s efforts to&nbsp;mislead&nbsp;and&nbsp;cover up their actions, the impeachment inquiry is quickly proving that the President asked Ukraine to intervene in next year&#8217;s elections in exchange for Congressionally appropriated military aid&nbsp;or a Presidential meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;a&nbsp;senior member of the Judiciary Committee,&nbsp;I&nbsp;offered my views in national television interviews&nbsp;as we consider what constitutes&nbsp;impeachable conduct.&nbsp; See my interview with CNN&#8217;s Poppy Harlow here and with Brianna Keilar here.&nbsp;  Applauding Introduction of the SONG Act in the Senate&nbsp;    This week, Tennessee Senators Marsha Blackburn and Lamar Alexander and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey introduced the Stadiums Operating under New Guidance (SONG) Act, a companion measure to&nbsp;the bill&nbsp;I introduced in the House in July along with Tennessee Congressmen Jim Cooper, Tim Burchett, John Rose and David&nbsp;Kustoff.&nbsp;The measure would&nbsp;give the&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)&nbsp;the&nbsp;authority to restrict air space over music concerts and other events at stadiums across the country,&nbsp;as the FAA&nbsp;already&nbsp;can&nbsp;over sporting events held at stadiums.&nbsp;See my release here.&nbsp;  Talking Impeachment with &#8220;The Circus&#8221; on the Showtime Network&nbsp;   Congressman Cohen talks with \"The Circus\" host Mark McKinnon  On Sunday night, my views on impeachment will be the focus of an in-depth documentary program called &#8220;The Circus&#8221; on the Showtime network. The show will air at 7 p.m. local time.&nbsp;  Attending the Funeral of My Friend John Conyers in Detroit&nbsp;  On Monday, I attended the funeral of my friend&nbsp;and mentor, Congressman John Conyers of Michigan, a champion of civil rights and justice, with whom I served when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. See my release about the funeral here. Last Saturday, I attended the funerals of my former colleague Rufus Jones and of former State Senator Reginald Tate.

The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act is now on its way to the President for his signature. Please share your thoughts with me on this issue.  Vern    Bill to Make Animal Cruelty a Federal Felony Unanimously Passed in Senate  Ewan Palmer  A bill which would make nearly all forms of animal cruelty a federal felony offense looks set to be passed into law after it was unanimously approved by the Senate. The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act was introduced by Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan and Democrat Ted Deutch after it was passed by the House of Representatives on October 22. The bill aims to close a loophole which existed following the introduction of the 2010 Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, which banned so-called \"crush videos.\" Crush videos are extreme acts of animal cruelty and torture&#151;including stepping on, mutilating or skinning animals alive&#151; which are posted online. The law made it illegal to create or distribute such a video but the \"crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impaling or other animal cruelty\" could not be prosecuted as a federal crime. The PACT Act is now expected to be passed into law when it arrives at the desk of President Donald Trump in the near future. \"Preventing animal cruelty is not partisan; it's part of our values as a country. I'm proud that this legislation moved so swiftly through Congress, with such broad bipartisan support,\" Deutch said in a statement. \"Our country needs a federal law to prevent abuse against animals. After years of hard work by so many to build support for this bill, we are now one signature away from it becoming the law of the land.\" The bipartisan passing of the bill was met with praise by The Humane Society of the United States. \"The PACT Act has now passed out of both the House and Senate and just needs to be signed by the President for the U.S to have a federal anti-cruelty statute,\" the group said. \"This is a huge win for animals and it could not have happened without YOUR commitment.\" After the bill was passed in the House, Buchanan said: \"The torture of innocent animals is abhorrent and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. \"Passing the PACT Act sends a strong message that this behavior will not be tolerated. Protecting animals from cruelty is a top priority for me and I will continue to work with Congressman Deutch to get this important bill signed into law.\" The bill provides exceptions to certain acts of animal cruelty. These include normal and customary veterinary procedures and the slaughter of animals for food. Hunting, trapping, fishing, and any other sporting activity not otherwise prohibited by federal law are exempt, as well as pest or predator control and acts of scientific or medical research. Anyone convicted under the bill would face a maximum of seven years in prison.            &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

I wanted to update you on some of the important issues I&#8217;ve been tackling as your U.S. Representative.  Impeachment of President Donald Trump:    I have been a strong supporter of the impeachment of President Trump.&nbsp; His conduct in office has been self-serving and detrimental to the security and prosperity of American citizens.&nbsp; On October 31, I cast the historic vote to support a House resolution (H.Res. 660) that outlined the rules and procedures that would be followed during the impeachment inquiry.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I wished I didn't have to cast that vote.&nbsp; I know the Founding Fathers gave the House of Representatives impeachment powers&nbsp; in case we had a leader who was so focused on personal gain or held allegiances to foreign powers to the point that it compromised his oath of office.&nbsp; But they never believed we would have such a head of state and added it on the rare chance that one was elected.  We have such a president now.&nbsp; When I walked onto the floor of the House and cast that vote for the impeachment inquiry, I did not cast it as a Democrat.&nbsp; I cast it as an American.&nbsp; I voted for it because we need leadership that puts the country first.&nbsp; We need a president who embodies and inspires the best in us, not the worst.&nbsp; Even conservative Republicans have said it will take years to undo the damage he is doing to the nation.&nbsp; The betterment of America cannot wait until the 2020 elections, we need to make it happen now.  Newark's Lead in Water Crisis UPDATE:  While&nbsp;back home in the district, I participated in Rep. Mikie Sherill's Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight hearing to discuss the effects of lead in drinking water.&nbsp; She gathered together a panel of experts in technology and health care to tell constituents about the health issues associated with lead in water and how modern technology is being used to deal with the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I first learned that there were unsafe levels of lead in Newark&#8217;s drinking water, I was        Rep. Payne, Jr. speaks at subcommittee hearing about lead in water    shocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same water my family and I drink and use to clean our food.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something I never thought could happen here because Newark has been known for having some of the cleanest, purest water in the country.  But aging pipes and inadequate filters have taught us that clean water is something we cannot take for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am doing everything I can to help my constituents during this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced the Test for Lead Act into Congress to establish stronger tests for lead in schools across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have signed onto a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make sure we have enough bottled water to supply residents until their drinking water is clean.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have signed onto another letter to the Department of Health and Human Services to make sure none of the tainted water ends up being mixed with formula that is fed to infants.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I handed out bottled water to constituents at two distribution centers in Newark- the Bo Porter Sports Complex and the Boylan Street Recreation Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave me a chance to meet with people affected by this crisis to discuss their fears about the drinking water and learn what other solutions might be available to help them get through it.&nbsp;&nbsp;No issue is more important than clean drinking water.  The Lower Drug Costs Now Act:  This month, I co-sponsored the Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3), which would finally take action to lower drug prices for Americans.&nbsp; The legislation would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices for Medicare patients directly with drug manufacturers to lower costs and then make those prices available to all patients.&nbsp; I am a diabetic and know first-hand how expensive insulin can be.&nbsp;     **Social Security Benefits to Rise 1.6% in 2020**    I have read the tragic stories of how people die because they have to choose between insulin or food.&nbsp; Some sufferers have rationed insulin to save money, which decreases the medicines effectiveness.&nbsp; This bill would target the drugs Americans spend the most on, with insulin specifically included.&nbsp; Americans should not have to make impossible choices because drugs are too expensive.  &nbsp;  Homeland Security for Children Act:&nbsp;  As a father, I know the safety and security of our children is the most important responsibility.&nbsp; I sponsored the Homeland Security for Children Act of 2019 because I believe that America can do a much better job protecting our children and infants before, during and after a disaster occurs.&nbsp; This legislation would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or FEMA) to create a new position, called the Children&#8217;s Technical Expert, so it can incorporate the needs of children when it plans emergency preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation activities. It would also make children&#8217;s needs a priority throughout the Department of Homeland Security with a directive to get feedback from children&#8217;s organization into other department-wide activities.       Rep. Payne, Jr. faces the tough questions from future journalists at Learning Community Charter School in Jersey City on Oct.9    Wells Fargo Neighborhood LIFT Program:&nbsp;  I have been working for months to bring Wells Fargo&#8217;s Neighborhood LIFT program to my district and I was excited to see it happen last month.&nbsp; Our district was selected as the recipient of the 75th Neighborhood LIFT program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wells Fargo will commit nearly $4 million dollars to help more than 180 of my constituents in Essex County and Newark get a $20,000 grant for a down payment on a new house.        Rep. Payne, Jr. attends homeownership event    In addition, Wells Fargo will provide them with financial counseling to help them stay homeowners.&nbsp; Home ownership is one of my main legislative priorities in Congress and I&nbsp;know a down payment can be the most difficult part of buying a house.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is more than the financial benefits of this program that make me proud.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you own a home, you plant roots in a community.&nbsp;&nbsp;You invest your time in local school events, contribute to local charities, vote in local elections and make friends with local residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;You create a foundation for wealth that you can pass on to your children.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Studies have found that children of homeowners do better in school.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are less likely to use drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are less likely to commit crimes and they are more likely to purchase their own homes later in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the tangible benefits for these 180 new homeowners.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But there are others benefits as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Property ownership has long been a pillar of the American Dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Founding Fathers knew that personal property was a form of personal liberty.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you owned property, you could control your destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I applaud our new homeowners for making an investment into our community.&nbsp; If they are first time owners in Essex County, I welcome them to our district.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Boeing Officials face Congressional Scrutiny: A safety review of the 737 MAX airplane  I have always thought the safety and security of American travelers is the main priority of my House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.&nbsp; When I heard that two of Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes crashed and killed 346 people, I thought about the families and their sudden loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;        Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg answers Congressional questions    After that, I wanted to make sure that never happened again.&nbsp; On&nbsp;October 30, Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg came before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to answer questions about the design flaws that contributed to those accidents.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although I appreciate Mr. Muilenberg's appearance before my committee, I was upset to learn that he received a $15 million bonus after the two accidents had occurred.&nbsp; I do not think leadership decisions that lead to fatal accidents involving any company's products should be rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;  There is nothing more important&nbsp;to me than&nbsp;listening to the voices of my constituents. After all, I represent you. You're the true leaders.&nbsp;The public input from my constituents led me&nbsp;to pursue alternatives to fight the contaminated water in Newark and keep up the work for gun violence prevention. I am lucky to have a district that is&nbsp;deeply involved in&nbsp;the progress of this great country.&nbsp;My offices are open to my constituents&#151;all of you.&nbsp;For regular updates on what I'm working on for you, follow me on social media.  Sincerely,  Donald M. Payne, Jr. Member of Congress&nbsp;        Join the conversation.             Social Media Spotlight &nbsp; I was excited to see the response to my Veterans Day flyer on social media.&nbsp; Please come to the event if you have time.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Legislative Corner In the month of October, the House of Representatives passed the following bills and resolutions to protect American interests and make lives better for the people of New Jersey.

H.R. 4695&nbsp;(The Protect Against Conflict from Turkey Act)-&nbsp; This bill imposes sanctions and various restrictions related to Turkey's military invasion of northern Syria.  &nbsp;             OFFICE LOCATIONS       &nbsp; Washington, DC 103 Cannon HOBWashington, D.C. 20515Tel: (202) 225-3436Fax: (202) 225-4160 Newark Office LeRoy Smith Public Safety Bldg.60 Nelson Place, 14th FloorNewark, NJ 07102Tel: (973) 645-3213Fax: (973) 645-5902 Jersey City Office 253 Martin Luther King Dr.Jersey City, NJ 07305Tel: (201) 369-0392Fax: (201) 369-0395 Hillside Office 1455 Liberty AvenueHillside, NJ 07205Tel: (862) 229-2994Fax: (862) 255-2941 &nbsp;           Unsubscribe |      p { margin-bottom:1em; }  ","district":"10","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NJ","party":"Democrat","score":3.1727908},{"name":"Senator Tim Scott","address":"donotreply@scott.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-11-05","subject":"E-Newsletter: Improved Access to Care for Diabetes Patients,\r\n National Adoption Month & SC Economic News","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       &nbsp;November 5, 2019 &nbsp;                About Tim Services Media&nbsp;Center Legislative Work                Dear fellow South Carolinians, Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter, and please remember to follow me on&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and&nbsp;YouTube.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved Access to Care for Diabetes Patients Last week, I joined Sen. Mark Warner to lead a bipartisan letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma, urging them to make CDC-recognized virtual Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) providers eligible for reimbursement in the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) expanded model. Including virtual providers would empower beneficiaries, regardless of their zip code, with feasible options for preventative, value-based care. In addition, including virtual DPP providers in the expanded MDPP and embracing digital health tools to empower patients would deliver better health outcomes and drive additional savings across the healthcare system. You can read more, including the full letter, here.  National Adoption Month On Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decided to repeal the regulation that threatened faith-based foster care and adoption agencies in South Carolina. It is fitting that this National Adoption Month, HHS has sided with our most vulnerable children in restoring the rights of the faith-based adoption agencies who care for them. South Carolinians can rest assured that their religious liberties are protected while we will continue to do everything we can to help our children find loving and nurturing homes. You can view the HHS announcement here.

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Senate Passes My CJS Appropriations Bill This week, the Senate passed my FY2020 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act with overwhelming support. This bill funds the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and many other agencies. Specifically, this legislation invests in federal law enforcement agencies, state and local law enforcement grants, space exploration, scientific research, economic development programs, trade enforcement, ocean observations, and weather forecasting. This CJS bill is fiscally responsible and prioritizes important federal programs that support economic development, law enforcement, and scientific innovation. I&#8217;m especially pleased that this bill accelerates the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon and cements America&#8217;s leadership in space exploration. I am proud to have worked closely with Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to produce a good government, bipartisan bill that enables numerous agencies within our jurisdiction to accomplish their missions, keep communities safe, and address the needs of our nation.&#8221; Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch my remarks on this bill.&nbsp;  &nbsp;USDA Selects New Headquarters Location in Kansas City This week, USDA announced that 805 Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Kansas City has been selected as the new site for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). I&#8217;ve long advocated that USDA&#8217;s ERS and NIFA relocate to the Kansas City metropolitan area knowing that regardless of what side of the border these facilities would land, it would be a positive development for the regional economy and so many institutions across Kansas and Missouri. I applaud the many entities across Kansas City who have worked to bring these agencies closer to the producers they serve. In addition, I&#8217;m committed to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan, bicameral way to secure the resources necessary for USDA to complete this move and to welcome their employees to Kansas City. Questioning Boeing CEO on the 737 MAX and the Future of Aviation Safety On Tuesday, during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I had the opportunity to question Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg on important issues regarding the now-grounded Boeing 737 MAX airplane. It is critical we find out what went wrong and investigate current policies and protocols to ensure similar tragedies don&#8217;t happen again. As the aviation industry is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, I&#8217;m committed to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure safety in the aviation industry is always the top priority. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch our discussion.&nbsp;    Announcing NIST Grant to Pittsburg State University On&nbsp;Wednesday, I was pleased to announce a grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Kansas Technology Center at Pittsburg State University. This award will help establish a recyclable plastics modeling and testing laboratory, and will allow PSU to continue leading the region and the country in polymers and plastics research.&nbsp;In order to compete in a global economy and to protect our country from adversaries, it&#8217;s important our businesses and manufacturers remain on the cutting edge. As the chief appropriator for the U.S. Department of Commerce and NIST, I&#8217;ll continue working with PSU officials to grow their expertise in this important field. To learn more about this grant for PSU, click&nbsp;here.    2019 Sports Fans Coalition&#8217;s Most Valuable Policymaker This week, I was honored to accept the Sports Fans Coalition&#8217;s 2019 Most Valuable Policymaker Award. The Sports Fans Coalition is a national non-profit advocacy group devoted to protecting the rights of the fan wherever public policy impacts the games we love. With new technological advances coming seemingly every day, we must ensure our fans are being treated fairly. My&nbsp;BOTS Act, which was signed into law in 2016, would do just that. The&nbsp;BOTS Act&nbsp;prohibits ticket scalpers from using automated purchasing technology to quickly buy large amounts of event tickets before the average fan has an opportunity to make a purchase, ultimately decreasing consumer choice and driving up prices. In addition, we discussed my work with Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to protect Olympic and amateur athletes from abuse. I appreciate their thoughtful and productive conversation on how we can all work together &#150; regardless of position or responsibility &#150; to end the abuse of athletes.&nbsp;I will continue to work with the Sports Fans Coalition and my Senate colleagues to protect fans from those that wish to take advantage of their passion.    Discussing Infrastructure and Transportation with Civic Council of Greater KC On Monday, I had the opportunity to meet with the KC Civic Council &#150; a nonprofit organization composed of some of the largest, private employers in the Kansas City area. During the meeting, we discussed critical issues to the KC area including infrastructure, workforce and trade issues. The meeting gave us a chance to discuss my Startup Act legislation which encourages job creation, innovation and advances economic development. This legislation will encourage growth in the KC area by developing policies that help recruit and retain highly-skilled students and innovators, and enable entrepreneurs to transform their ideas into companies. The legislation is supported by a diverse group of industry in the KC area, and I look forward to continuing to push for its final passage.&nbsp;    Junction City Welcome Home Ceremony  On Saturday, I was honored to join our 1st Infantry Division soldiers and their families at Junction City's Welcome Home Celebration. During the celebration, it was announced that Junction City was awarded as one of this year&#8217;s Great American Defense Communities. And this celebration was evidence of why Junction City is known as one of the best Army hometowns in the country. Welcome home to Fort Riley soldiers who have been deployed across the globe over 2019, and a big thank you to the All American Beef Battalion for serving our active duty soldiers at the event.    Hosting a Ness County Townhall Meeting On Friday, I was in Ransom to host a Ness County Listening Tour Stop. During this stop, we discussed a number of issues including veterans&#8217; access to healthcare and implementation of the&nbsp;VA MISSION Act, agriculture and the importance of passing USMCA, our work to make certain rural America can thrive, the ongoing impeachment proceedings, challenges in rural healthcare delivery and border security. Thanks to all those who took time to visit with me on Friday, and thank you to Herb Schwartzkopf and the Ransom VFW for hosting my visit to the community.    Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

Previous estimates had put the cost of Medicare for All at $32 trillion over ten years. But a recent study by the left-leaning Urban Institute pegs the tab at $34 trillion. An additional $2 trillion is no small sum. That money represents half the current federal budget, three times what our country spends on our military, and more than the value of all of the goods and services produced in Canada every year. The revised $34 trillion total is another reminder of how unsustainable Medicare for All would be. The bill&#8217;s sponsor, Senator Bernie Sanders, has openly acknowledged that only massive middle-class tax increases could pay for what it would require. Costs are not the only concern. The policy would take away Americans&#8217; health-care choices, increase wait times, and limit the potential for future medical innovations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act &#150; also known as Obamacare &#150; has already shown what can happen when the government&#8217;s role in health care grows. Prices skyrocketed and people could not keep the plans or doctors they liked. Americans are right to wonder why it would be wise to double down on the mistakes of the past.&nbsp; Insurance Provided at Work Would End  Proponents of Medicare for All should stop repeating outlandish promises. They should come to the table and engage productively. That is the only way to find a solution that would give more Americans the care they want at the time they need it from the doctors they trust. Proposals should not throw out what works about America&#8217;s health-care system, including what works about Medicare. More than 600,000 Mississippians over the age of 65 rely on Medicare. Medicare for All would immediately take away options like Medicare Advantage, and it would eventually empty the U.S. Treasury. With no money left to spend, Medicare for All would become Medicare for none. Medicare for All would also make most of the existing private insurance market illegal, taking away coverage from more than 180 million people. A new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 76 percent of participants like the coverage they get on the job. That type of insurance would end if Medicare for All became the law of the land. The Way Forward  Americans deserve a say in their health-care choices, which are some of the most personal decisions that anyone can make. Given the proper tools and regulatory framework, our citizens are more than capable of picking the best plans to fit their needs. President Donald Trump has made empowering consumers, lowering costs, and keeping protections for people with preexisting conditions top priorities. His administration has given small businesses the option to join together in associations to negotiate lower prices. It has also granted waivers from some of the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s burdensome mandates on insurance exchanges so that states can customize coverage options for their residents&#8217; health needs. Congress is taking action as well. The Republican Senate recently voted to keep these waivers in place.&nbsp; I cosponsored legislation to protect existing association health plans and expand their benefits to more than 400,000 uninsured Americans. I also recently introduced the bipartisan CONNECT for Health Act of 2019, which would grow access to telehealth services in rural parts of our country like the Mississippi Delta. Republicans on Capitol Hill are ready to work with our Democratic colleagues on health care. But Medicare for All is a dangerous distraction. It would prevent positive reforms and could cause devastating results.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Other news this week:  &nbsp;  Wicker Statement on House Impeachment Vote  Wicker Hyde-Smith Lead Effort to Expand Telehealth Services  Wicker Votes to Maintain State Waivers for Obamacare Mandates  Wicker Statement on Death of ISIS Leader     &nbsp;    Follow me on Facebook for daily updates  Follow me on Instagram&nbsp;for behind the scenes photos&nbsp;  Follow me on Twitter for my most recent statements   Unsubscribe to future eNewsletters here.

This summit was the result of language that was included in the FAST Act legislation at my request.&nbsp; During the summit, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao announced nearly $50 million in new initiatives to expand access to transportation for seniors and people with disabilities. Throughout my time in public service, I have advocated for and worked to improve access and mobility for seniors and people with disabilities. I thank&nbsp;Secretary Chao&nbsp;for hosting this important conversation and dedicating resources to improve and expand transportation access for these Americans. I look forward to continuing to work together to identify and improve ways to provide more efficient, affordable and accessible services.  _______________  Last Thursday, the House Democrats held a vote on a resolution regarding impeachment. It was merely one more attempt to deceive Americans by claiming it provides transparency and due process. In reality, this sham resolution does nothing to change the Democrats&#8217; soviet-style impeachment process.&nbsp; The Democrats&#8217; Impeachment Resolution:  Does not allow the President or his counsel to participate in proceedings before six of the seven impeachment committees. Restricts actions by Republican members to issue subpoenas and call witnesses to be subject to the approval of House Democrats &#150; who have already denied Republican committee members ability to even ask questions of current witnesses. Pretends to require Chairman Schiff to hold a single public hearing, yet this something he could have chosen to do from the start. &nbsp;Instead, he has been holed up in a secure room in the basement of the Capitol.  Throughout my time in Congress, I have advocated for a more transparent, member-driven process. This soviet-style impeachment inquiry is the opposite of what America&#8217;s Founding Fathers envisioned. For these reasons, I voted no on House Resolution 660.    _______________  Recently, Hernando County announced that Bayport Pier would reopen in Spring of 2020.&nbsp; This is great news! Earlier this year, my office worked with Hernando County Officials and individuals at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NOAA to help the county obtain the pertinent permits required for reconstruction. Additionally, a portion of the cost of this reconstruction is eligible for reimbursement by the federal government as Hurricane Hermine and Hurricane Irma caused significant structural damage to the pier, leaving it unsafe for use.&nbsp;  This fishing pier is a landmark in Hernando County, enjoyed by local fishermen and children for many decades. I am committed to continuing to assist as needed and look forward to the reopening of the pier.   _______________  Last week I had meetings with advocates, stakeholders and local officials from Florida regarding The Everglades. Leaders from FL Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, The Everglades Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, Captains for Clean Water and more came to DC to share the latest updates and information regarding projects that will restore and preserve this precious ecosystem.  In particular, we discussed exciting new developments regarding projects ready to move forward, the need for consistent funding, and challenges posed by delays within the Army Corps of Engineers. As a senior member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I have worked to pass Water Resources Development Acts (WRDA) since 2014. These bills have provided key authorizations for Everglades restoration and preservation projects within the Central Everglades Planning Project. I am committed to holding federal officials accountable to ensure these critical projects are moving forward.    _______________  Each November, we pause to remember and honor our veterans. While it is fitting to set aside a day to honor these brave men and women, remembering, serving and showing gratitude to our veterans is something we should do every day. In recent months, I&#8217;ve learned of combat-related incidents where U.S. service members state they have been unjustly incarcerated for actions taken while defending the U.S. and fighting for our freedoms.&nbsp; Along with several of my colleagues, we have studied several cases and advocated on behalf of several such veterans &#150; including First Sergeant (1SG) John E. Hatley. 1SG Hatley was court-martialed and found guilty of premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit premeditated&nbsp;murder of four Iraqi detainees&nbsp;in 2007 near Baghdad. This is despite the lack of any forensic evidence of any kind and based solely on the testimony of a few soldiers who had taken pre-trial agreements in exchange for testimony leading to his conviction.&nbsp;To reiterate &#150; because it is hard to fathom &#150; investigators do not know the identity of those who they said were murdered. No bodies were ever found. No one was reported missing despite a massive investigation and countless interviews with Iraqi locals. No physical evidence existed at all. Last month, several members of Congress and I wrote or testified to support his request for release on parole.&nbsp; While, the Army Review Board approved his parole release, they set the date for October 2020. 1SG Hatley has served 11 years of his 25-year prison sentence. During this time, he has maintained his steadfast innocence, love and dedication to country, loyalty to the Army and has served his sentence to date with the utmost respect for the rules of his confinement. After being approved for parole, there is no perceivable benefit for the Army to keep him in prison another year, it merely delays his opportunity for meaningful employment and reintegration to his community which has shown him significant support throughout this time. Given this, on Friday, I and several members of Congress, wrote the Army Review Boards Agency and requested they grant 1SG Hatley parole in time to join his family this Christmas.  _______________  Each year the U.S. Small Business Administration celebrates service members during&nbsp;National Veterans Small Business Week (NVSBW). Today marks the beginning of the sixth annual NVSBW. Each day during the week, the Small Business Administration will be highlighting different topics related to veteran entrepreneurship, including entrepreneurial training, access to capital, and transition assistance. Whether just starting a business or expanding an existing one, the Small Business Administration is here to provide the tools to help veterans on their journey to small business success.     Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress  &nbsp;  Constituent Corner A family member of a recently deceased veteran requested a Presidential Memorial Certificate on his behalf but had not received a response. My office followed up with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and learned that the previous application had lacked supporting documents. My office worked with family to obtain and provide the required supporting documentation to the appropriate VA office. Within one week, the family received the certificate.  Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.&nbsp;  District Update On Wednesday my District Director Christa Pearson attended Habitat for Humanity of Hernando County&#8217;s groundbreaking ceremony for the next three homes they are planning to build. Thank you to Habitat for Humanity for all they do to meet the housing needs of families throughout our communities!   &nbsp;On Saturday, Cindy Brown from my office in the Villages, participated in the Villages 24th annual Government Day. This event is an opportunity &nbsp;to help educate residents about the services that local agencies and governments have to offer.    Legislative Update On Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 4695, the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey (PACT) Act. This bill is a response to Turkey&#8217;s military invasion of Northern Syria and their attacks on our Kurdish allies. The bill imposes visa and asset-blocking sanctions on certain Turkish officials linked to the invasion, including Turkey&#8217;s Minister of National Defense. The bill also instructs President Trump to impose sanctions on the large, state-owned Turkish bank, Halk Bankasi/Halkbank, as well as any financial institution that the U.S. State Department determines to have been knowingly involved in the invasion. Under this bill, the State Department will also be required to report to the President and Congress other Turkish officials and foreign persons that knowingly provided assistance for the invasion.

The death of this depraved individual is a huge win for America and all the civilized world, and it sends a clear message to those that would use terrorism to pursue their evil ends that they cannot escape the long and mighty arm of the United States military. I thank our President for his decisive leadership in ordering this raid and our special operatives for their courage and bravery in undertaking this extremely dangerous operation.  Tricking the American People From Day 1 of Donald Trump's presidency, House Democrats have tried dressing up their impeachment inquisition as a legitimate inquiry instead of what it really is: a purely political ploy aimed at discrediting and destroying our duly-elected President. That&#8217;s why it is only fitting on Halloween, Democrats tried to put a costume of credibility to disguise their political witch hunt of Donald J. Trump and distract from their radical, socialist policies &#150; which should scare all Americans.  House Democrats&#8217; relentless pursuit of this impeachment scam is hurting our ability to get things done on behalf of the American people like passing USMCA and passing legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. In fact, this Congress, Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have had bills signed into law. It&#8217;s past time for Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s political theater to exit stage left so we can get back to doing our jobs, debating the real issues, and solving real problems.  Bringing the Prescription Drug Pricing Process Out of the Darkness All Americans are rightly concerned about the ever-rising costs of prescription drugs. One of the reasons why drug costs have spiraled out of control is because discounts negotiated by the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)&#150; the middle-men in the drug supply chain &#150; are shrouded in secrecy. Americans are left in the dark about the rebates these PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers, and while we have no idea where the rebate value is going, we know where it&#8217;s not going &#150; to our seniors at the point of sale.  To that end, I&#8217;m proud this week the House passed bipartisan legislation I led that provides more transparency in an otherwise opaque process that will help ensure rebates go towards reducing the cost of drugs for seniors. This legislation also includes the text of my bill, the Shop Rx Act, which requires drug plans for seniors to offer real-time information regarding the various options of drugs and their associated costs. By providing seniors with access to the readily available, relevant information they need in order to be real consumers in the healthcare market, we will empower them with the knowledge to choose the options that best fit their needs and their budget. And because consumers will have more information, they will have more choices and insurers will have to actually compete for their business, which will ultimately bring down the cost of drugs- something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on.

Ushering in American Energy Dominance At the heart of America&#8217;s economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy. American energy independence is undoubtedly a matter of national security, but it's also a question of life &amp; death for our rural communities. In West Texas, energy producers are as crucial to our communities as our educators, healthcare providers, &amp; ag producers. Click here to watch my remarks opposing HR 2181, Democrat-led legislation that would ban future mineral development in an area outside the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which would put a choke-hold on energy production by our New Mexico neighbors and members of the Navajo Nation tribe.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs We continue to see more great news come out about our economy, which was once again confirmed with the latest jobs report. October&#8217;s numbers showed the economy added 128,000 jobs last month, exceeding economists&#8217; expectations. This is just goes to show that President Trump and Republicans&#8217; pro-growth policies have brought greater freedom in the marketplace are helping Americans keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets where it belongs. Now it&#8217;s time to keep our foot on the pedal by passing USMCA and ushering in the 176,000 new jobs that this better, fairer trade deal will deliver.  Hometown Hero Earlier this week, Lubbock Police Department Officer Thomas Thompson, a finalist for the Police Officer of the Year Award, was honored by President Trump at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in Chicago. Officer Thompson is part of a long line of defenders of our democracy as guardians of the public safety and the Rule of Law, and we are all grateful to his bravery and service to keeping the Lubbock community secure and our families safe.

Each of these bills is a direct result of the conversations I have had with many of you on what our farmers need to be successful, and I am grateful to be a part of moving these critical bills forward.&nbsp; I also wanted to address an important vote that many of you may have questions about. This week, I voted yes on formal procedures that will provide Democrats and Republicans equal time and a public forum to question witnesses and move forward with a fair and impartial impeachment inquiry. I believe the U.S. House must continue its work to uncover all of the facts and carry out our responsibility to ensure that no elected official is above the law. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to my DC (202-225-2271) or Burnsville (651-846-2120) offices.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to press Boeing officials on how they are going to work to improve flight safety and transparency to avoid future tragedies, stood with my colleagues in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and helped pass a Minnesota delegation-wide effort to allow the State Department to fund a U.S. Pavillion at the Expo 2020.&nbsp; I&#8217;m committed to continuing to listen to you and working to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, invest in career skills and technical education, support our family farmers and fully fund special education. In Washington  Preserving public lands: This week, the House voted for a bill to protect over 1 million acres of land in the Grand Canyon for generations to come. As we took this vote I thought back on a family trip we took many years ago to the Grand Canyon - feeling grateful to take such an important vote for our nation&#8217;s public lands.   Putting the US on the world stage: In order for the entrepreneurship and innovation of our country to be on full display at Expo 2020, we need the partnership of the State Department. This week, a bill that Rep. Dean Phillips led to allow the State Department to fund a U.S. pavilion at Expo 2020 passed out of the House. This bill will make our cities more competitive locations for hosting future Expos, and I'm proud to work with my fellow Minnesotans on this bipartisan, delegation-wide effort! Learn more here.  Fighting for safe flights: It is clear that the tragic Boeing 737 Max crashes were not only avoidable, they were caused by neglect and lack of oversight within Boeing. This week, in a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing, I pressed Boeing officials on what they are doing to ensure safety and improve transparency.&nbsp;  It's absolutely unacceptable that planes known to be unsafe were allowed to fly, and that families lost loved ones as a result. Rest assured, I'm continuing my work to hold Boeing accountable and reform FAA certification and reporting systems to make sure similar tragedies never happen again.     Giving farmers flexibility: I&#8217;m committed to making sure our family farmers have common sense laws they need to succeed, but burdensome regulations stand in the way. This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill to provide more flexibility when transporting live animals and perishable goods. Learn more about the bill here.  Supporting small businesses: Small businesses like Storm Creek in Hastings and River Valley Power and Sport in Red Wing drive economic growth in tourism and help Minnesotans get outside! Thanks to River Valley owner John Wooden for sharing your small business success story in the House Small Business Committee this week!    Breast cancer awareness: October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and I&#8217;m proud to work with my colleagues to fund the research and innovation we need to fight this disease and get patients the care they need. Rural mental health: Farmers across this district and the country face stress from a difficult farm economy and unpredictable markets. I recently helped introduce the Seeding Rural Resilience Act to bring rural mental health resources to farmers in their communities. Learn more here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing in clean water: This week, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee moved the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act out of committee. I support this common sense bill to invest in infrastructure to keep Minnesota&#8217;s water sources clean and drive job growth by maintaining our wastewater and stormwater facilities.    Touring IAFF: The International Association of Fire Fighters are national leaders in the effort to improve resources for IAFF members struggling with addiction, PTSD, and mental health challenges. It was an honor to tour their state-of-the-art treatment facility this week.    In Burnsville  Women&#8217;s Small Businesses: October is Women&#8217;s Small Business Month, and in a special edition of Small Business Saturday, last week I toured Olivia&#8217;s Organic Cafe - a fantastic women-owned business in Burnsville that&#8217;s one of my new favorite places to eat healthy.

There is no reason members of Congress should be held to a different standard than American families and businesses across the nation, and Senator Scott will continue to fight for this commonsense reform.

Rick Scott Statement on Baghdadi&#8217;s Death  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump&#8217;s announcement of the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Senator Rick Scott&nbsp;said, &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement of the killing of Baghdadi &#150; one of the most notorious terrorists in the world &#150; is great news for the security of the United States and our allies. I want to thank our men and women in uniform that carried out this mission and continue to fight for freedom around the world. This is an important step in the fight to defeat ISIS, a terrorist group that inspired the Pulse terrorist attack and that is responsible for the deaths of thousands around the world, including Floridian Steven Sotloff.&nbsp;  &#8220;To the enemies of the United States, this is yet another reminder that there is nowhere you can go, there is nowhere you can hide. We will not stop until justice is served. Today the world is a little safer, a little kinder, a little more free.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Introduces Amendments to Put American National Security First  Senator Rick Scott announced two amendments to the package of spending bills currently before the Senate to prohibit the U.S. Government from purchasing technology manufactured in Communist China.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Communist China is STEALING our technology and intellectual property, yet the U.S. Government continues to buy critical technology, like drones and communications equipment, with American tax dollars from Chinese companies backed by their government. For far too long, we have turned a blind eye to Communist China and allowed their technology into some of the most critical operations of the U.S. Government. We have to get serious about this, and I&#8217;m working to make sure American national security comes first.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and James Lankford Introduce TIPS Act to Address FBI Failures  Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and James Lankford introduced the Threat Information Protocol for Sharing (TIPS) Act to hold the FBI accountable for its failures to address critical deficiencies in its handling of actionable intelligence on the perpetrators of mass violence. This legislation is supported by Stand with Parkland, an organization founded by the family members of the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t think about the 17 souls that were taken from us in a brutal act of violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Following the tragedy, we all worked together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act to make our schools safer and prevent future tragedies, but we aren&#8217;t finished. We cannot accept the repeated failures of the FBI to properly investigate and act on specific tips received about the Parkland shooter, as well as other perpetrators of mass violence in Florida. I&#8217;m proud to introduce the TIPS Act, which bridges the gap between federal and state law enforcement agencies by mandating information sharing of all state-specific criminal intelligence tips. This is about getting information on threats into the hands of the right people, who can ultimately prevent violence and protect our families.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Jim Inhofe and Colleagues Introduce Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Jim Inhofe and colleagues to introduce the Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act, which would prohibit abortion based on an unborn child having Down syndrome.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Every child is born with dignity and deserves to be welcomed into the world. As a father and a grandfather, I am proud to fight for every life, and I hope all of my colleagues join me in protecting the most vulnerable among us.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Inhofe's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Interior Department&#8217;s Decision to Protect National Security and Ground Drones Made in Communist China  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the Department of the Interior&#8217;s decision to ground its fleet of Chinese drones amid concerns of foreign surveillance. Last month, Senator Scott introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China.  Senator Rick Scott said,&nbsp;&#8220;Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, I&#8217;m glad to see the Department has seen the light and reversed course. We should not, under any circumstances, put American national security at risk by using taxpayer dollars to purchase Chinese tech. We must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants. We need to completely reassess our posture towards Communist China, and passing my bill is a good start.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and John Cornyn Introduce Legislation Condemning Communist China&#8217;s Human Rights Violations   Senators Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and John Cornyn introduced the&nbsp;Hong Kong Be Water&nbsp;Act condemning Communist China&#8217;s violation of human rights in Hong Kong. The legislation also calls for sanctions against the Hong Kong authorities and Communist Chinese government officials who are denying human rights to the people of Hong Kong under orders from President Xi.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;During my trip to Hong Kong earlier this month, I met with protesters who are fighting to regain the freedom they were promised by Communist China. I heard horrible stories of police brutality, threats, and intimidation. As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue. I&#8217;m proud to sponsor the Hong Kong Be Water Act as we stand with the brave Hong Kongers fighting for freedom and basic human rights that are being suppressed by Communist China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott on Senate Floor: Let&#8217;s Work Together to Lower the Cost of Healthcare for Americans  Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate Floor about the Democrats&#8217; latest attempt to prevent states from having any flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens. Senator Scott is working on real solutions to lower the cost of healthcare for Americans.   Read excerpts of Senator Scott&#8217;s remarks as prepared for delivery below or his full speech HERE.  What we&#8217;ve heard this week from my Democrat colleagues on healthcare is just more of the same. More fear-mongering, more misinformation.&nbsp;  The issue this week is what&#8217;s called 1332 Waivers.&nbsp;  These waivers allow states flexibility in how they implement healthcare programs.&nbsp;  It&#8217;s a simple concept. Every state is different. Every state should have the flexibility to design their healthcare programs and regulations in a way that best fits the needs of their citizens.&#133;  But here&#8217;s the problem&#133;the Democrats don&#8217;t believe in state&#8217;s rights, or allowing state taxpayers and citizens ANY flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens.  The Democrats want these top-down, one-size-fits-all federal programs. If there is choice and flexibility, they want to restrict it. It&#8217;s how big government works, and the Democrats love big government, restrictive mandates, and socialism.&#133;  We need to reduce healthcare costs and provide a safety net for those who cannot afford their healthcare, not create a federal government-organized healthcare market, which causes healthcare costs to skyrocket.  Giving flexibility to the states is an easy way to increase access and quality of care for the American people.&#133;  Enough with the misrepresentations. Enough with the nonsense. Enough with the fear mongering. The American people deserve better.&nbsp;  Let&#8217;s work together to lower the costs of healthcare, so all taxpayers can get the care they need at a price they can afford.&nbsp;&nbsp;              Sen. Rick Scott: We Need to Fight for the Values that Made America Great  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner to share his personal story and priorities as a United States Senator.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;&#133; Even though my Mom had no money, she was optimistic and hopeful. She told us we were blessed because God and our founders created the greatest country ever, where anything was possible.&#133;  While I didn&#8217;t always appreciate my tough-love, my-way-or-the-highway Mom growing up, I now thank God every day for my Mom and this country. She gave me the opportunity to experience every lesson this country had to offer before I was 20.  Unfortunately, the left has worked hard over the last 50 years to discredit the values of the America I was raised with and the values of the America I want my grandsons to grow up with. We all acknowledge that Americans, our country, and our institutions have flaws, but the left has worked to discredit our founders, our institutions, our churches, our law enforcement, our morals, and almost everything my mom taught me.&#133;&nbsp;  The values that I grew up with, the ones my tough-love mom taught me, are becoming a way of the past. But I believe these values, these virtues, can and should be part of our country&#8217;s future.&#133;  In the meantime, let's fight for the country I was raised in because that is the country our children and grandchildren deserve.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.  &#151;  Florida Daily:   Fox Business:   Fox News:   Bloomberg:   The Hill:  Florida Daily:  Florida Daily:  Bloomberg:   Florida Daily:   Florida Daily:   Acci&#243;n 97.9:   El Nacional:               As the best state in the nation to live, work and raise a family, it's no wonder everyone wants to move to Florida.

This week, Speaker Pelosi admitted as much, finally relenting and putting up a formal vote in the House on a resolution authorizing the impeachment process.  Of course, to no one's surprise, the rules and procedures laid out in the Democrats' impeachment resolution made the process even worse:   It continues the series of unfair, biased proceedings we've watched unfold over the last month.&nbsp;  It promises the President certain rights to assure fairness -- but then leaves it up to Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff to decide whether he and his legal team can actually exercise them.  It includes no guarantee that witnesses requested by Republicans will actually be called to testify.  It does nothing to prevent Adam Schiff's selective leaking of hearsay that fits the Democrat narrative designed to damage the President.&nbsp;  This impeachment process has been a sham since the get-go, and it's only getting worse. I'm going to continue to hold the Democrats accountable for this affront to our republic and our Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sincerely,                         &nbsp; Washington DC Office 2439 Rayburn HOBHouse Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-2731Fax: (202) 225-5773 Brunswick County Office 310 Government Center Dr.Unit 1Bolivia, NC 28422Phone: (910) 253-6111Fax: (910) 253-6114 Johnston County Office 4001 US Hwy. 301 S.Suite 106Four Oaks, NC 27524Phone: (919) 938-3040Fax: (919) 938-3540 New Hanover County Office 201 N.

Any change you make during this period will affect your coverage for 2020, starting on January 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To compare health insurance plans and find the best policy to meet the health needs and budget for you and your family, please visit GetCovered.Illinois.Gov or call 866-311-1119. It&#8217;s important to look at all the options. Even if you had coverage last year, you should review your family and income information and see if the plan is still the best fit for you. If your information has changed significantly, you will not be automatically re-enrolled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year more than 312,280 people in Illinois were covered by a private plan they got through the Affordable Care Act, and many enrollees received financial assistance to help cover some of their costs.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage you to visit GetCovered.Illinois.Gov or make an appointment with a navigator to find the best plan for you. Be sure to enroll by December 15 if you want coverage for the beginning of 2020.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you have difficulty accessing these resources or have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to contact my District Office at (630) 520-9450 or visit my website at Casten.House.Gov for links to additional resources.

Dear Friend,  Kayla Mueller, a 26-year old from Arizona, was working as a humanitarian aid worker when she was kidnapped by ISIS in 2013. For 18 months, Kayla was tortured and abused by ISIS. Reportedly forced to marry their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, she was one of four Americans murdered by ISIS&#151;and one of thousands of innocent civilians slaughtered by al-Baghdadi and his band of depraved criminals. For years following Kayla&#8217;s murder, al-Baghdadi&#8217;s criminal syndicate known as ISIS flourished in Syria and northern Iraq&#151;enforcing their sick, twisted Sharia law and torturing and murdering as they saw fit. President Obama failed to defeat what he referred to as the &#8220;JV team&#8221; of terrorist organizations. Unlike President Obama, President Trump took the threat posed by ISIS&#151;and radical Islamic terrorism as a whole&#151;seriously from day one.  President Trump&#8217;s renewed focus on fighting radical Islamic terrorism is paying off. Vast swaths of Syria and northern Iraq once controlled by ISIS were recaptured&#151;and ISIS&#8217;s territory has been reduced to just one percent of what it once controlled. This has greatly reduced ISIS&#8217;s ability to squeeze funding from the civilians it brutalized and its illegal oil sales, and, in turn, reduced their ability to carry out horrific acts of terrorism in Syria and around the globe. This week, Kayla&#8217;s family and loved ones finally got some sliver of closure. U.S. Special Forces tracked down al-Baghdadi and cornered him with dogs in the tunnels under his compound. Terrified of being held accountable for his crimes, al-Baghdadi triggered a suicide vest, killing himself and two of his children. He died a coward, desperately trying to escape justice. However, we can all rest easier knowing there&#8217;s one less radical Islamic terrorist madman roaming the earth&#151;and that he&#8217;ll face a justice far more powerful in death.&nbsp; This fight isn&#8217;t over. This victory is not the end of radical Islamic terrorism, or even ISIS alone. Radical Islamic terrorism remains a threat to freedom and peace around the world. I pray we never lose sight of that&#151;and that together, we will prevail in eradicating this scourge from the face of the earth&#151;just like we did with al-Baghdadi this week.

This is the number one issue people in our district ask me about, and has been my priority since getting to Congress.  Back in June, a Republican member and I introduced a bill called the &#8220;Real-Time Benefits Act.&#8221;&nbsp;It&#8217;s a bipartisan bill, and it will help lower out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.  Well, on Monday night it passed the U.S. House of Representatives with unanimous, bipartisan support. It&#8217;s now on to the Senate.  Here&#8217;s how it works: insurers would be required to upload information on drug prices which doctors would access through their electronic prescribing program. Doctors and Medicare Part D patients could then receive details, right in their doctor&#8217;s office, on the price of a drug based on insurance plan, the price of any cheaper drugs that would fit their needs, and the price difference at each pharmacy. Patients would leave their doctor&#8217;s office knowing the cheapest price for a prescription, and where to get it.&nbsp;  This will not only lower the out-of-pocket costs that seniors, in particular, are paying for drugs, but it will inject much-needed price transparency into our system. Price transparency will help support good old-fashioned competition &#150;&#150; which helps lower costs across the board.     Since I got to Congress, I&#8217;ve been focused on what we can do to follow through on those bipartisan areas of agreement, and come up with practical legislation that can drive costs down. Democrats and Republicans have both said the right things when it comes to lowering prescription drug costs. They have talked the talk. Now it&#8217;s time for the Senate to walk the walk.  I am incredibly proud that our legislation passed, and I&#8217;ll be sure to keep you updated on the next steps.

As India's middle class grows, so too does their demand for more agricultural products, especially tree nuts.&nbsp;  Currently, the Indian tariff on U.S. pecans is 36%, compared to 10% for&nbsp;U.S. pistachios and almonds.&nbsp;Lowering the disproportionally high tariff on U.S. pecans would provide the Indian people with more economical access to all tree nut varieties, while also providing a much-needed economic boost to the U.S. agricultural industry and our rural communities.

I continue to be alarmed by the fact that my colleagues in the majority party remain focused on partisan games instead of working together to find solutions that will benefit all Americans. With only 21 days left of the legislative calendar, I am growing concerned about whether they will even make time to consider the appropriations bills that are necessary to fund our first responders and the military set to expire November 21. I am also disturbed by the lack of transparency they are displaying in their partisan activities. The time for serious problem-solving is upon us, and I hope my colleagues will rise to the occasion. Despite these disappointments there was some progress made on important matters. Continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf last week.  Ensuring Our Heroes Receive the Treatment and Benefits they Deserve  It was a great privilege to be able to greet local participants in last week&#8217;s Honor Flight during their visit to Washington, D.C. I am a big fan of this special program, as these heroes deserve the opportunity to experience the gratitude of our nation for their service. I hope they all had a wonderful and memorable visit.   My legislation to protect Veterans' benefits continues to move forward. This legislation is about doing the right thing for our heroes, and I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this effort. Read more here.&nbsp;  Advocating for Public Safety Improvements  I am continuing to push for a final decision on the Ridge Road Extension Army Corps of Engineers&#8217; permit. This public safety project is an important component of ensuring sufficient evacuation routes.&nbsp; On Tuesday, I made a call to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Colonel Andrew Kelly, who is overseeing the project, and I am optimistic that we will receive a favorable decision soon. Read this local&nbsp;story to learn more.   Protecting Our Four-Legged Friends  Last week, an important bill I co-sponsored passed the House. The PACT Act will help prevent horrific acts of animal cruelty. As co-Chairman of the Humane Bond Caucus, I believe all of our four legged friends deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. This bipartisan measure was originally introduced by two of my Florida colleagues, Representatives Buchanan and Deutch. I urge my Senate colleagues to expedite its passage. Learn more about this initiative by watching this local&nbsp;news report.&nbsp;   Keeping our Kids Safe Last week was National School Safety Week. There is no greater priority than protecting our children, which is why I have taken many proactive steps to help our local law enforcement and school districts keep students safe at school.   Just two weeks ago, I helped Pasco County secure a $500,000 federal grant to better identify students at risk for mental health issues and link them with critical mental health resources. I also have filed two bills that would provide additional resources. &nbsp;The PROTECT KIDS Act would create a funding stream for employing more School Resource Officers in the largest school districts throughout the country, including Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas. According to local Superintendents and Sheriffs, this is the single most important thing I can do to help them with their efforts. A second bill I have sponsored is the bipartisan STANDUP Act of 2019, which encourages schools to expand evidence-based suicide prevention training to students in grades 6 through 12. This bill, which I coordinated with Sandy Hook Promise on developing, would also provide training for threat identification, triage, and intervention, as well guidance and protocol for coordinating with local law enforcement using established school threat assessment models. More than 20 states already require suicide prevention programs in schools, which demonstrate effective reductions in suicide, bullying, aggression, and violence between students. These programs have also decreased rates of expulsion and suspension. By providing high quality screening and prevention training to school staff and peers, we can identify threats before they materialize, and ensure that those who are at risk get the mental health treatment they need. Sadly, some communities in my district are among those with the highest suicide rates in our state. With training like this, we can help reverse that troubling trend. I was also proud to co-sponsor the STOP School Violence Act of 2018, which just resulted in Florida schools receiving $291 million in federal grants to improve school safety. I will continue to fight on behalf of Florida&#8217;s children, because every student deserves a safe and secure learning environment. Read more&nbsp;here. &nbsp;&nbsp;   When I returned from Washington last week, I had the chance to visit Palm Harbor University, which is one of the local schools using the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation&#8217;s evidence-based suicide prevention training. I enjoyed talking with school leaders, law enforcement, teachers and students about the effectiveness of the program and how my STAND UP Act legislation would benefit students in other schools. Please be assured I will continue to do everything I can to help keep our kids safe at school.  Helping People With Rare Diseases  Rare diseases are not a rare problem. It is estimated that 30 million Americans are living with one of the 7,000 known rare diseases. Most of these rare diseases do not currently have treatments or cures. The bipartisan bill I filed last week is about providing hope to those who are struggling with rare, life-threatening illnesses. It renews the federal programs which provide critical support in the advancement of research for better treatments and the infrastructure necessary to organize registries that help ensure transplant patients have access to life-saving procedures. I hope my colleagues will join me in expediting passage of this important legislation. You can read more about this legislation, by clicking on this story.  Increasing Tourism  As co-Chairman of the Travel and Tourism Caucus, I understand the importance of reauthorizing the Brand USA Program. The bipartisan&nbsp;bill I have co-authored reauthorizes this highly successful initiative through 2027, and has the program rely on fees from international tourists for funding. Last year, Brand USA reached 1.13 million international tourists who helped add almost $9 billion to the economy.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a bill that would increase revenue and jobs, while lowering the deficit all without spending a dime of taxpayer dollars. It&#8217;s a no brainer even for Washington, D.C.!&nbsp; Raising Awareness  October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Unhealthy relationships can start early and last a lifetime. Teens often think some behaviors, like teasing and name-calling, are a &#8220;normal&#8221; part of a relationship&#151;but these behaviors can become abusive and develop into serious forms of violence. However, many teens do not report unhealthy behaviors because they are afraid to tell family and friends. There is help available. Call 1-800-799-7233 for help!   Constituent Corner  Last week I received this note from a constituent. &nbsp;  \"I am a RN at the James Haley VA hospital in Tampa, Florida. Recently I experienced a very stressful situation that no person should have to go through. My Payroll office was deducting money from my paycheck due to a series of errors on their part. I had reached out to my Boss, My Union Rep., and a lawyers&#8217; group for help. Every single person I spoke with understood the gravity of my situation and helped immensely in anyway they could. A friend of my wife recommended That I reach out to your office for help. I thought, YES, especially due to the fact that Congress oversees The VA System.&nbsp; I reached out to Robert Fleege, who very honestly acted as a friend helping a friend rather than as a Congressional person acting on behalf of his office. He assured me that he and Congressman Bilirakis would do everything in their power to help resolve my issue.&nbsp; I received notification via email last night that the payroll office has approved my waiver, and acknowledged that I was in no way at fault for this mess, and that all the money that had been taken from me, without my consent, will be repaid in full. There are no words to express my gratitude, Mr. Congressman, for your help, and for your Aide&#8217;s help. Robert Fleege is a Pitbull when it comes to helping others. I appreciate you Gentleman so much. Thank you! My family thanks you! I can relax a bit better now with this mess behind me.\" This is just one example of the work we do each and every day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!  Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.  My team was privileged to listen to Medal of Honor recipients share their stories of patriotism, character and courage with the students of Centennial Middle School last week. What a true learning experience it was for everyone in attendance.   My team was also honored to help participate in the Pasco County Stand Down event last weekend which connects homeless Veterans with vital community resources and housing. I appreciate all of those who came together to help make a positive impact on our community.   My team enjoyed participating in the Pepin Workforce Education Summit this morning. It was an informative program highlighting the importance of hiring people with disabilities. The speakers shared insight from the student, employee, and employer perspective. #NationalDisabilityEmploymentAwarenessMonth   Additionally, my team was happy to participate the grand opening of a new business in Wesley Chapel last week. Row House, a boutique fitness concept, is revolutionizing the way people view indoor rowing. Welcome to the neighborhood!     Thank you for reading this week&#8217;s update.

If you have been watching the news this week, you know as well as I do that it is a frustrating time to be in Washington, D.C. The impeachment inquiry has proved to be a major distraction from tending to legislative business, but I haven't let it stop me from working on policy that will positively impact the Fourth District. This week, we celebrated National Forest Products Week. Roughly 33 percent of the U.S. is forested, and we're blessed to have an abundance of trees in Arkansas. Did you know that: - About 86 percent of the land mass in the Fourth District is forested. - Agriculture is the leading economic driver in Arkansas, and forestry makes up the largest sector of agriculture in Arkansas. - Trees are renewable and biodegradable, providing an ample amount of resources for products we use daily. Forest products are part of our everyday lives. Everything from hardwood flooring and building materials, paper towels and napkins, paper office supplies and cardboard shipping boxes all starts with a tree. One of my top priorities will always be giving the forestry industry the necessary tools to succeed so that we can continue using forest products. I was pleased to meet with so many great people in the industry this week and learn about the latest innovation in forest products. Until next week, Bruce Westerman Arkansas' Fourth District Email Updates* *Yes, please per**iodically send me email updates.** *By subscribing to my email updates, you are authorizing me to send regular email updates from my office to your email account. *Throwback to the Southwest Forest Products Expo in Hot Springs this year! It was great to see innovative new products and meet Arkansans that drive this industry forward.* I really enjoyed participating in Timber Innovation Day on Tuesday and speaking at several events. If we want more trees, we should all be using more products made from trees. Timber companies are constituently using innovative techniques to make wood products more affordable and accessible, and I look forward to seeing how the industry develops in future years. I had to sport my Southern Yellow Pine tie to celebrate National Forest Products Week! I visited the Seguin Moreau stave mill in Malvern on Thursday afternoon. This mill reopened recently and produces white oak barrels for distribution. Earlier this month, the Fay Jones School of Architecture at the University of Arkansas hosted its Timber Design Excellence Symposium. I was honored to speak at this event and learn how the college is teaching students how to use wood products in architecture. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] Contact Information: Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC 209 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-3772 Fax: (202) 225-1314 El Dorado 101 N.

Maloney Dear Lindsey, This morning, we said our final goodbyes to the late, great Elijah Cummings. He is the first African American lawmaker to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol - a fitting honor for one of the most honorable men I have ever known. I am proud to have known him, to have worked with him, and to have learned from him. We will carry on his legacy of fighting for justice, equality, and our democracy. Earlier this week, the work of Congress continued. On Monday, I unveiled a new report on the links between gun ownership and suicide and on Tuesday and Wednesday the House voted to pass two of my bills - the first on ending anonymous shell companies and the second to reauthorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program. More on all this below. *New Report: *Guns and Suicide** [image = As Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I issued a new report on Monday entitled *Guns and Suicide* [link 1]. I was proud to be joined by Giffords, the Brady Campaign, and people who have lost family members to gun suicide for its release. And what the report found is clear - access to a gun increases the likelihood you will die by suicide. In other words, a gun doesn't make you safer, it can actually put you in significant danger. Suicide takes an enormous toll on families, friends, communities, co-workers and others. This is a public health issue and, sadly, it's an economic issue as well. Lifetime medical and work-loss costs due to suicides and suicide attempts are estimated at almost $70 billion per year, or about $1.5 million per death on average. If we reduce firearm suicides, we would make substantial progress in addressing the gun violence epidemic in America. Now, the challenge and the responsibility before Americans is to do something about it. I've said it before and will say it again: The inaction of the President and Senate Majority Leader McConnell is literally killing Americans. This report makes that even clearer. *Cracking Down on Anonymous Shell Companies* On Tuesday, the House passed my bipartisan *Corporate Transparency Act *to crack down on anonymous shell companies - one of the most pressing national security problems we currently face. These shell companies are being used by money launderers, criminals, and terrorists - but with this bill, we can stop that. We're the only advanced country in the world that doesn't already require that companies disclose their true, beneficial owners when they're formed -- and frankly, it's an embarrassment. Law enforcement has told us they need this information. Right now, they hit brick walls when trying to \"follow the money\" because of anonymous shell companies - we need to tear down that wall. Beyond the impacts for law enforcement, this bill will also help to crack down on New York's real estate being used to park illicit money, driving up housing costs and limiting availability. It seems that more than ever before, there are too many dark windows in apartments in NYC at night - but with this bill, it is my hope that this practice will be put to an end. Too many anonymous LLCs - instead of families - own NYC apartments. The Senate needs to act to pass this bill without delay. *Reauthorizing the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program* Across the country, DNA evidence sits in a backlog because forensic labs don't have the resources they need to process it, denying justice to victims of violent crime. So, in 2004, I wrote and passed the Debbie Smith Act - which at the time was called the \"the most important anti-rape legislation ever signed into law.\" The Debbie Smith Act authorization expired on September 30, and we must act quickly to reauthorize it to make sure that this successful program continues to help solve and prevent violent crime and protect survivors. This grant funding keeps rapists and other criminals off the streets. And perhaps more importantly, it can deliver some measure of justice to survivors of violence. The Senate needs to pass and send this bill to the President's desk immediately. As always, your concerns still and always will remain my top priority.

Hello all, This was a big week here in Washington! I worked with Senator Tina Smith to introduce a bill to expand partnerships between schools and businesses so students have the skills they need to fill the high-skill jobs of Minnesota&#8217;s future.&nbsp; This bill will help drive economic growth in Minnesota, fill our jobs gap, and give students a range of options when considering post-secondary education and career paths. My oldest son Josh pursued a manufacturing degree, and I want to make sure every student has that same opportunity to explore career options that are the right fit for them.&nbsp; Additionally, my bipartisan bill to strengthen small business mentorships passed out of the House with overwhelming support, and I supported an essential piece of legislation to secure our elections from foreign interference. In Washington:  Expanding career opportunities: Every Minnesotan deserves access to job skills that can lead to a good-paying career. It&#8217;s time we rethink how our schools and our jobs align. This week, I was proud to join Senator Tina Smith in introducing the 21st Century Workforce Partnerships Act. This bill will expand workforce training partnerships between schools and business, and make sure young people are presented with apprenticeship and manufacturing programs as viable pathways to a successful career. Learn more here.&nbsp;  Strengthening small businesses: I could not be more excited to announce my bipartisan bill to strengthen small business mentorships passed out of the House with overwhelming bipartisan support! Giving small business owners the tools they need is something we can all agree on, and I'll keep working on bipartisan ways to drive economic growth in Minnesota. You can learn more here.  Protecting election security: It is absolutely essential that we secure our elections and defend the integrity of our democracy. This week, I voted for the SHIELD Act, a comprehensive election security bill to stop foreign interference in our elections and improve the transparency of online political ads.  Lowering prescription drug costs: Skyrocketing prescription drug prices stand in the way of economic opportunity for families across Minnesota. I&#8217;m working with Accessible Meds to change that by holding big drug companies accountable and increasing access to more affordable generics. Thanks for having me this week!    Safe at home: I&#8217;m proud to work with fellow Minnesotans Rep. Dean Phillips and Rep. Betty McCollum, who just&nbsp;introduced the Safe At Home Act to strengthen protections for victims of domestic violence. It is essential to protect victims and survivors and to ensure they have the resources, dignity, and safety they deserve. If you or someone you know needs help, you can find resources here.  Investing in disaster resilience: Protecting Minnesotans from natural disasters is something we can all agree on, and we need to proactively invest in infrastructure to reduce recovery costs. I spoke to folks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this week on my work to pass the Resilience Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019. Grateful to work with Rep. Rodney Davis and partners like the U.S. Chamber on this essential bipartisan effort to fund disaster mitigation projects!

These are shocking numbers. But then again, every number related to the opioid epidemic is alarming.  According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 130 Americans die every day from opioid overdoses. The opioid crisis claimed the lives of 47,000 Americans in 2017.  The impact of this national epidemic has been felt acutely in the Natural State. CDC data showed we had the second-highest prescribing rate over recent years&#151;enough for each Arkansan to have more than one opioid prescription in his or her name. It has taken a conscious effort by the medical community to drive those numbers down from approximately 250,000 opioid prescriptions per month in 2014 to nearly 220,000 opioid prescriptions per month in the later portions of 2018&#151;a 12 percent decrease over a four-year period. Rogue actors writing illegal opioid prescriptions cannot be allowed to set back the progress that Arkansas&#8217;s medical professionals have made to responsibly reduce that number.  That&#8217;s why the announcement of these charges is so important. We cannot stem the tide unless we enforce accountability among prescribers.  At the press conference announcing the charges, Kees said \"I hope this is a wake-up call. And trust me when I say, there will be many more wake-up calls to come.\" Both Kees and Cody Hiland, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, have been empowered to hold suspected over-prescribers responsible. This move sends a clear message as to their intention to crack down on this behavior in order to end the plague of opioid addiction in Arkansas.  Ensuring illicit opioids do not continue to flood our communities and state without consequence is an important part of our overall strategy. Congress has responded to the crisis with a variety of solutions aimed at promoting a comprehensive approach to reverse the trend. In Fiscal Year 2019, the National Institutes of Health awarded $945 million in grants to improve treatment for chronic pain, decrease the rate of opioid addiction and aid in long-term recovery of opioid addicts.  In addition to funding, Congress has taken action by providing tools to drive innovative and long-term solutions that will spur the development of new non-addictive painkillers and ensure parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits.  With my support, Congress increased family-focused care and encouraged recovery by supporting states&#8217; efforts to address substance use disorders by increasing access to medication-assisted treatment, health professionals, long-distance care and recovery housing services.  The treatment and recovery aspect of our strategy is key. Federal resources are being deployed nationwide to break the cycle of addiction. These grants are invaluable for facilities that give addicts and their families new hope in the fight against opioid abuse. We have a responsibility to ensure that these investments are delivering the intended results. The good news, from what I've seen firsthand at treatment facilities in Arkansas, is that these efforts are indeed helping.   You can help break the cycle of addiction by participating in Arkansas Take Back on Saturday, October 26 and dropping off expired, unused and unneeded drugs at a collection site close to you.  _______________________________________________________________________  Quick Takes:    Cybersecurity Protection and Awareness: We all have a stake in safeguarding sensitive personal data. I have seen the commitment of Arkansans to support cybersecurity efforts at all levels of government, in our homes and private businesses. The American Cyber Alliance hosted its 2nd annual Arkansas Cyber Summit last week bringing together leaders from across the state to discuss the need for enhancing collaboration to reduce cyber threats. October is recognized as Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Read my latest column about the need to renew our focus on protecting our data and the efforts by Arkansans to combat cyberattacks.  Protecting Arkansas Wildlife and Traditions: Leaders at all levels of government must take action to fight the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD). Arkansas conservationists and sportsmen are increasingly concerned about this disease and its impact on wildlife and sport hunting. Last week, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing examining the effects of disease on wildlife conservation. I shared with my colleagues the innovative ways the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission is fighting the spread of CWD, supporting conservation and protecting our wildlife so we can keep the tradition of hunting alive and well for future generations.   Improving Veterans Benefits: Sometimes it takes an act of Congress to modernize VA benefits, like in the case with the Blue Water Navy legislation which expanded benefits to veterans who served aboard ships off the coast of Vietnam. In other cases, the VA gets new information about exposure to toxins or side effects that makes veterans eligible for additional benefits, which opens the door for revising the department's policy. I am hopeful that we can build on the recent momentum, and the recent Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing looking at the topic of toxic exposure, to ensure all of our veterans who answered the call to serve get the care they have earned.   Welcoming an Arkansan as Guest Chaplain: I was pleased to welcome Dr. Robert Lewis, the former directional leader of Fellowship Bible Church of Little Rock, to the Senate recently. He delivered the opening prayer in the U.S. Senate as the guest chaplain. Dr. Lewis is a renowned pastor, best-selling author, passionate speaker and Christian visionary. The Senate Chaplain invites two ordained clergy members, each month, to pray in the Senate as guest chaplains. Guest chaplains have represented all the world's major religious faiths.   Recognizing Arkansas Veterans: The&nbsp;&#8216;Salute to Veterans&#8217; series honors the service and sacrifice of Arkansas veterans who served our nation in uniform. In the latest edition, I highlighted the service of&nbsp;former Arkansas National Guard Adjutant General and veteran of Operation Desert Storm Major General (retired) William Wofford. He served for 43 years in uniform. MG Wofford's entire interview will be submitted to the&nbsp;Library of Congress Veterans History Project.

You can find me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       &nbsp;      &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;                 Click here to open a plain text version of this email&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to forward this email to a friend&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to open this e-mail in its own window&nbsp;   ","district":"3","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"AR","party":"Republican","score":3.78355},{"name":"Senator Jeanne Shaheen","address":"newsletter@shaheen.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-22","subject":"A tragic toll","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                 Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window                &nbsp;      October 22, 2019  Dear Friend,&nbsp;  It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate. Last week was a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues I&#8217;ve been working on.&nbsp;  Helping Law Enforcement Officers Cope as They Keep Us Safe    WATCH:&nbsp;WMUR reports&nbsp;on Shaheen&#8217;s after meeting with law enforcement officials  Law enforcement officers are under enormous pressures as they protect our communities every day and it&#8217;s taking a tragic toll. Nationally, we now lose more officers to suicide than in the line of duty. Sadly, New Hampshire is not exempt. We have lost far too many officers in the past several years. I was at the Nashua Police Department last week to discuss how important it is that we continue to talk about this crisis publicly so we can begin to address it. I&#8217;m fighting for resources to provide support to all of our first responders and their families. We owe it to these public servants who risk everything to keep us safe every day.  PFAS Health Impact Study Moves Forward And You May Be Able to Help  This has been a long time coming: the PFAS Health Impact Study is getting underway and is seeking participants. This study, which is focusing on contamination at the Pease International Tradeport, is the first of its kind in the nation and will ultimately help Granite Staters and impacted populations around the country affected by PFAS contamination by shedding light on the health risks. This study has been a top priority of mine for the last several years because it will help deliver the answers that New Hampshire families who&#8217;ve experienced PFAS contamination so desperately need. If you suspect that you or someone you know has been impacted by PFAS exposure at Pease, I encourage you to consider participating in this study and help spread the word about the need for participation. The more people participate, the more useful and accurate the data will be, which will help deliver answers. Find out how to get involved&nbsp;here.  New Law Honors the Legacy of Christa McAuliffe   Christa McAuliffe  My legislation, the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act, was just recently signed into law to pay tribute to the legacy of Christa McAuliffe. Fittingly, it came the just days before astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir stepped outside the International Space Station for the all-female spacewalk in human history.&nbsp; The Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act requires that a commemorative coin honoring Christa be created, with proceeds from this coin going to support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. I&#8217;m heartened by the bipartisan support that ushered this law through Congress, and I am glad that it will&nbsp;ensure future generations of students in New Hampshire and across the country know Christa&#8217;s inspiring story and&nbsp;get involved in STEM.&nbsp;  A Disastrous Decision by President Trump in Syria    Shaheen highlighting the dangers of the President's decision during her Senate floor remarks  Last week, I&nbsp;spoke on the floor of the Senate to express my alarm at President Trump&#8217;s reckless decision to withdraw American troops from Northeast Syria and abandon our Kurdish partners in the region who helped us pushback against ISIS&#8217; once-significant territorial gains. Their efforts and sacrifices, including the death of over 11,000 of their own forces, allowed the U.S. to hold a strategically significant area in northeastern Syria. The President&#8217;s shortsighted decision, unfortunately,&nbsp;gave Turkey the green light to launch an incursion into the region which has resulted in ISIS fighters escaping prison, the slaughter of our partners and innocent civilians, and a security vacuum which is being filled like Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. When I visited this region in July 2018, I witnessed firsthand the&nbsp;value of U.S. troops in the region. Their presence helped&nbsp;stabilize this region, allowing its people to rebuild and recover from years of horrific oppression by ISIS. Learn more about the bipartisan efforts I support to hold Turkey&#8217;s President Erdogan accountable for his actions from my floor speech here.  Update from Hampton Harbor Where Dredging Has Begun    Shaheen speaks to Major Mark Gilman, Deputy Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers - New England District while visiting the dredging operation at Hampton-Seabrook Harbor  Yesterday, I stopped by Hampton-Seabrook Harbor, where I got to see the start of dredging operations to combat the extreme shoaling that has prevented boats from getting in and out of the harbor during low tides. The harbor plays a critical role in the Seacoast economy supporting hundreds of jobs. Dredging was needed to keep it safe for the dozens of party-fishing boats, numerous fishing and lobster boats, emergency response craft, as well as approximately 1,500 recreational vessels that are launched through the Hampton River Marina. This has been a top priority of mine and you can hear more about our efforts to secure funding for, and the positive impacts of the harbor dredging here&nbsp;here.  Need Help? Contact My Office  One of my most important responsibilities as a U.S. Senator is assisting New Hampshire residents who need help navigating federal agencies. I&#8217;ve worked with my staff to help Granite Staters avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, deliver delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance, and access VA benefits, among many other services. If you have an issue with a federal agency, you can open a case&nbsp;here. If the matter is time-sensitive, you can call my Manchester office at (603) 647-7500. Here are a few examples of how my office has helped Granite Staters.  Dr. Tim Gardner, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center: &nbsp;Dr. Tim Gardner of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center called my office with an urgent request: a patient in his care had pancreatic cancer and needed a drug recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). My staff reached out to the FDA, whose staff contacted the manufacturer, which resulted in the drug being secured along with the necessary permission to use it for the patient.&nbsp; Kevin Dremel, Keene: &nbsp;Kevin contacted my office after he had difficulty getting in touch with the New Hampshire Liquor Commission regarding expanding his cracker business to a kitchen in a local winery. My staff reached out to the Governor&#8217;s office, which resulted in the Liquor Commission following up with Kevin and authorizing his request to sublease the space. Brian Collins, Ashland: Brian got in touch with my staff after erroneously receiving word from the IRS that he owed a penalty for failing to pay his 2015 taxes on time. An error had the IRS mistakenly listed Brian&#8217;s tax return as having been submitted late. Brian had tried to reach the IRS by phone to resolve the mix-up but his efforts were unsuccessful. We contacted the IRS on his behalf, and provided Brian&#8217;s original tax return with the correct on time date. Upon review, the IRS realized this mistake and erroneous penalty was cleared from Brian&#8217;s account.&nbsp;  Sincerely,    ###  To opt out of future eNewletters, click here.      &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington, DC506 Hart SOBWashington, DC 20510Phone: (202) 224-2841 Manchester, NH2 Wall Street Ste. 220Manchester, NH&nbsp;03101Phone: (603) 647-7500 Claremont, NH50 Opera House Sq.Claremont, NH 03743Phone: (603) 542-4872 Nashua, NH60 Main StreetNashua, NH 03060Phone: (603) 883-0196 &nbsp;             &nbsp; Dover, NH340 Central Avenue Suite 205Dover, NH 03820Phone: (603) 750-3004 Berlin, NH961 Main St.Berlin, NH 03570Phone: (603) 752-6300 Keene, NH12 Gilbo Ave. Suite CKeene, NH 03431Phone: (603) 358-6604 &nbsp;            ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"F","state":"NH","party":"Democrat","score":3.2642071},{"name":"Representative Katie Porter","address":"CA45KP.Outreach@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-21","subject":"EVENT ALERT: Service Academy Info Night","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                     Dear Friend, Orange County is known for its educational excellence, sending our students to some of the best universities in the country. Many of these students are a great fit for the five U.S. service academies, which provide high quality education for those interested in careers in the United States Military. One of my most sacred duties in Congress is nominating local high school students for selection to the United States Military, Naval, Air Force, and Merchant Marine Academies. In many ways, these outstanding young men and women studying at military academies go on to serve as the next generation of American leaders. I strongly encourage all qualified candidates with a passion for public service to apply. On Wednesday, October 30th, my office is hosting a Service Academy Information Night at Trabuco Hills High School to connect our students to representatives from the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and U.S. Coast Guard Academy.

The Subcommittee hosted USDA Deputy Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics Scott Hutchens who is tasked with overseeing the work of several USDA research agencies. Members asked the Undersecretary about the timeline for releasing Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020 grant funds, staff shortages in the research agencies, and the implications of relocating the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture outside of the Washington, D.C. area. * House Veterans' Affairs Committee* [image = On Wednesday morning, I attended the House Veterans' Affairs Committee business meeting as we marked up six bills under our jurisdiction. These bills were all voice voted out of committee and reported favorably with bipartisan support. The legislation included updates to the G.I. Bill benefits, changes to improve legal services for homeless veterans, and legislation to improve transparency by posting VA reports online. Later that day, the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing called \"Broken Promises: Assessing the VA's Systems for Protecting Veterans from Clinical Harm.\" We heard from witnesses from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and Veterans Health Administration on how to improve quality of care following several concerning cases of patient harm. Witnesses discussed how to address gaps in training and improve oversight of the department. * City of Moorhead* [image = I met with Mayor Jonathan Judd of Moorhead along with several other advocates for their proposed Grade Separation Project. This project would separate downtown from 11th Street by building two underpasses and adding new bicycle and pedestrian facilities along with storm water management features. In July, I sent a letter with Senators Klobuchar and Smith to ask Secretary Chao to award a Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) Transportation grant to help fund this important safety project. * CentraCare* [image = *Kenneth Holmen, MN, President and CEO, Paul Harris, SVP and General Counsel, Santo Cruz, Executive Director, Government & Community Relations* I met with CentraCare executives this week to hear about updates at CentraCare as well as rural access issues and other rural health care issues that are facing Minnesotans. We talked about specific issues facing farmers and veterans, and the group thanked me for my work in the district. I'm proud to serve on both the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and to use these platforms to improve services for my constituents. CentraCare is one of the biggest health systems in Minnesota with many locations in the 7th District, including hospitals in Long Prairie, Melrose, Paynesville, Willmar, Redwood Falls, and Sauk Centre. * National Electric Contractors Association* [image = I met with Gregory Rick, VP of Rick Electric based out of Moorhead and Grand Forks. Greg and I discussed the contracting process with the government, work we can do to ensure contactors get paid in a timely manner for projects, and other labor and infrastructure related topics. We had a great conversation of all the changes in Detroit Lakes over the years. It was wonderful to catch up with Greg, and I look forward to working with our electric contractors for years to come. * University of Minnesota Professor Testifies on Chronic Wasting Disease* [image = Dr. Peter Larsen, Assistant Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of Minnesota's College of Veterinary Sciences, testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies last Thursday. He shared what his team at the University is doing to counter the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease, a contagious and lethal disease that affects cervids such as deer, moose and elk. Following his testimony, Dr. Larsen met with my team to discuss his research and ways the federal government can support local efforts to prevent the spread of CWD. The University of Minnesota has been traveling across the state of Minnesota to educate the public about Chronic Wasting Disease.

They shared their concern that consolidation of input suppliers and land ownership is making it harder for small farms to survive. They shared their policy proposals and my office gave them an update on the progress of various trade negotiations. * AARM* [image = *Juliana Keen, Sr. Director of Advocacy, Lutheran Social Service (St. Paul), Ric Nelson, President & CEO, EON (New Ulm), Connie Menne, Vice President, REM (Edina), Rebekah Solem, Maret Wibel (Fall intern)* AARM, a Minnesota-based trade association representing organizations that provide mostly residential services to individuals with disabilities, stopped by my Washington office on Wednesday while in town for their national conference. The delegation met with my staff to discuss issues impacting home and community-based service providers. The group expressed their support for addressing the shortage of workforce professionals and discussed legislation that would help address Medicaid reimbursement issues. Home and community based service providers play a large role in serving rural Minnesota communities and supporting local businesses. * Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership* [image = *(Left) Andrew Wilkins* A representative of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership met with my staff last week to talk about the effect of Chronic Wasting Disease on hunting opportunities across the nation. Cervid hunting generates significant revenue in Minnesota through licensing fees, tourism, and the purchase of sporting goods. It is important that government, researchers, conservation groups and cervid farmers work together to prevent the spread of the disease. * League of Minnesota Cities Regional Meeting* [image = The 7th Congressional District covers 38 Counties in western Minnesota, and spans over 377 miles. The League of Minnesota Cities held a Greater Minnesota Regional Meeting in Benson. In addition to hearing legislative updates on issues that are affecting our small cities, one of the featured agenda items was child care challenges in small cities. The lack of access to affordable, quality child care in rural America hurts not only families but also employers. In March, I introduced the bipartisan *Child Care Workforce and Facilities Act* to address the shortage of quality, affordable child care in rural communities. During the LMC meeting in Benson, Shelly Vergin, the Director of Community Education, Carissa McDonald the Director of Discovery Kids, and Benson School Superintendent Dennis Laumeyer, discussed how the Benson area communities got together and tackled the challenges of child care shortages and how Benson Public Schools met the challenge by opening a Child Care/Early Learning Center in the district. * Red River Water Management Board Office* [image = My staff attended the October Meeting of the Red River Watershed Management Board (RRWMB) in Ada. The RRWMB has a newly remodeled office space next to the Wild Rice Watershed District Office. One item of business was the funding for various projects. * 9th Judicial District* [image = The 9th Judicial District includes 17 counties in the north central and northwest part of Minnesota. The courts are working hard day after day to administrate justice in our communities. With improvements to cell service in the court, judges can use GPS bracelets to monitor parolees. This one change could lower costs by keeping many people closer to where they live. Another change is a faster turnaround time when drug and other tests are needed. Many court cases wait for these results before their case can be brought up. Other courthouses around Minnesota have a wide range of access to technology and safety for the people who work there. [image = In the past week the Administration's abrupt change in support for our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS have dominated the news. Survey/Question [survey] * Questionnaire Results* Last week, I asked you about the hunting season in Minnesota. Here is what you had to say: [image = [image = [image = [image = This past week, 7.5 billion was spent on servicing the national debt. That is equal to the amount of money the U.S. Government will spend on Homeland Security's Victim Assistance Program this year. The program is part of U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement and provides crisis intervention, counseling, and emotional support to human trafficking victims. I have continually supported a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which would require Congress to get our fiscal house in order. I have also fought for Pay-As-You-Go legislation to ensure legislation doesn't add to our debt and recently voted against the Democratic budget which would have worsened our fiscal situation. * Newsstand* * Over $350k Awarded to Three Tribal Colleges in Minnesota* The United States Department of Agriculture recently awarded over $350,000 to three tribal college in Minnesota - Leech Lake Tribal College, Red Lake Nation College, and White Earth Tribal and Community College for infrastructure improvements.

Domestic Violence Project Incorporated (DVPI) was awarded $310,147.00 from the Department of Justice to support their transitional housing program for victims of domestic violence and abuse to help survivors escape from dangerous home situations and begin to build new lives. OneEighty Incorporated also received funding from the Department of Justice, with $444,042.00 allocated for their transitional housing program to help break down barriers that often come with breaking away from situations of domestic abuse, including waiting periods for public housing and financial barriers. Adaptive Sports Program of Ohio (ASPO) was awarded $158,641.25 to partner with the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center to launch a year-round adaptive sports program for veterans with physical and visual disabilities in the Cleveland metro area. Lisa Followay, ASPO&#8217;s President and CEO, was the first featured constituent on my website. Learn more about her touching story here. The Turn in North Olmsted is receiving $41,700 to support their golf-oriented physical therapy program that serves more than 200 participants annually, free of charge.  Congratulations to all four of these great organizations! Addressing the online child exploitation crisisA recent New York Times report on online child exploitation laid out horrific facts that demand immediate action. According to their report, technology companies have reported 45 million images and videos depicting abuse over the past year, more than double what they found in the previous year. Additionally, despite the Protect Our Children Act becoming law in 2008, law enforcement agencies continue to face major obstacles in their efforts to combat the problem. This is something that Congress should be looking at head on, so this week I lead a letter with a bipartisan group of my freshman colleagues to push the Committees on Homeland Security and Judiciary to take up this issue by holding hearings to address the failures of current policy implementation and find paths forward to better combat online child exploitation. As a new father, I can only imagine the lasting and extremely damaging effects of online child exploitation on our youth. Congress must address shortcomings in current law and put forth innovative solutions, including the use of new technologies, to protect our children and keep this content off the internet. Combating rising suicide ratesTaking a look at the steadily rising suicide rates across our country is truly humbling. In Ohio, suicide rates among children ages 14 and under increased by 80 percent from 2008 to 2017 according to the Ohio Alliance for Innovation in Population Health. Nationally, the veteran suicide rate stands at 1.5 times the rate for non-veteran adults, with 6,139 U.S. Veterans dying from suicide in 2017 alone. To address this growing crisis, I introduced a new bill this week to promote research that can help us learn more about the root causes of suicide attempts, including human genetic, behavioral, social and environmental factors. Learn more about the bill on my website here.

Currently, more than 9% of homeless adults across America have served in our nation's uniform, and many of those individuals have children. That's why I voted for the Homeless Veteran Famlies Act [link 1] this week. Currently, the VA doesn't have the authority to provide reimbursements for the costs of services for minor children of homeless veterans. This has proven to be a financial burden to providers and in turn has limited housing options for veterans with young children. This important bill would allow the VA to reimburse providers for 50% of the costs of housing minor dependents of homeless veterans who receive services through the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program. I'm pleased to report that the bill passed the House in a bipartisan and unanimous vote of 408-0. I'm hopeful the Senate will act quickly so we can get this legislation signed into law and provide relief for those who have so selflessly served our country. But that's not the only good news I have for Ohio veterans. This week, the VA also awarded $292,975 in federal grants for Ohio adaptive sports programs for veterans. I'm proud to have consistently supported the Adaptive Sports Program and worked to increase its funding by $6 million this past year. I applaud the VA for awarding these grants to help our veterans improve their independence, well-being and quality of life through adaptive sports and therapeutic programs. Learn more here [link 2]. *Working to End Violence Against Women* During my more than 25 years as a prosecutor, I encountered my fair share of terrible crimes, but few haunt me more than those of sexual violence. Sadly, more than 10 million Americans become victims of domestic violence each year and in 2015 alone, the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services reported that there were 8,447 sexual assault victims - and that's not including the estimated 63% of sexual assaults that go unreported. That's why I have been proud to reauthorize the historic Violence Against Women Act both times it has come up for a vote since you sent me to Washington. Since its enactment in 1995, VAWA has protected millions from domestic abuse, sexual violence and stalking. It has accomplished that in part through numerous grant programs aimed at developing our nation's capacity to both strengthen victim services and hold offenders accountable. On Friday, the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, which administers many of those grant programs, awarded the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence [link 3] (which is located in Independence, Ohio) $151,242 to help combat these horrific crimes in our communities. As a loving husband and father, as well as the Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I will continue to do everything in my power to eradicate the threat posed by any and all forms of sexual and domestic violence. *Standing with Hong Kong, Standing for Freedom* On Tuesday, I was proud to be one of the Members of Congress who voted to ensure America stands with Hong Kong and the values of freedom by passing the PROTECT Hong Kong Act [link 4], the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act [link 5], and H.Res. 543 [link 6], which condemns China's interference in Hong Kong's affairs and supports the people of Hong Kong's right to protest. Even before the latest protests, the U.S. State Department reported that rights and liberties in Hong Kong had diminished. By passing these bills, the U.S. House of Representatives has made it clear that we support the people of Hong Kong and admire their courage for continuing to advocate for self-governance and the right to freedom. *Our Inspiring Future Leaders * Last week, I mentioned that I had the opportunity to participate in Mentor Model UN's opening ceremonies.

There are steps Congress can take to help our seniors and hardworking families, yet, Speaker Pelosi continues to ignore calls for a bipartisan solution to address rising costs. Instead, Speaker Pelosi is working to appease the most extreme socialist members of her party and radical special interest groups. In doing so, Democrats are putting politics over progress by jamming a half-baked bill through the committee process and denying members the opportunity to further examine or work across the aisle to improve the bill. \"The Energy and Commerce Committee has a well-established history of working in a bipartisan manner to pass important legislation, but H.R. 3 falls woefully short of that standard  passing out of committee along party lines. Pelosis partisan prescription drug bill puts forth a socialist, government-controlled approach to address prescription drug costs. It allows the government, through an unconstitutional taking,to nationalize the prescription drug industry by imposing draconian taxes on drug manufacturers. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would have a chilling effect on vital life-saving medical innovation, driving both investment and jobs overseas to places like China, while potentially compromising the oversight and safety of prescription drugs. \"Rather than continuing to push this socialist prescription drug bill through the House, that will be dead-on-arrival in the Senate, House Democrats should work with Republicans, as they have previously done, on bipartisan solutions that promote competition, lower out-of-pockets costs for patients and increase transparency and accountability in drug pricing.\" Impeachment Process \"This week, the House reconvened after a two-week district work period. During the work period, the consistent message that I heard from hardworking Texans was that they want to see the House work on the priorities that they care about most - securing our border, fixing our broken immigration system, approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, addressing prescription drug prices, improving our health care system and continuing Americas energy dominance in an environmentally responsible manner. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats had other plans. They spent the two-week work period in Washington behind closed doors playing political games with their continued attacks on the President through their sham impeachment process. Instead of voting to authorize an impeachment inquiry, Democrats continue to bring in their cherry-picked witnesses and question them behind closed doors, away from the view of the American public. \"While this whole process reeks of nontransparent partisanship, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, took his actions to another level when he lied to the American people about his committee not having contact with the whistleblower. Additionally, Representative Schiff fabricated a story in which he deliberately mischaracterized events that happened and is leaking snippets of information to fit the Democrats false impeachment narrative. Given that Representative Schiff continues to mislead the American people, I joined my fellow colleagues in sponsoring a resolution to condemn and censure him. \"If House Democrats are so confident in their move to impeach, they should be doing so in an open and transparent manner that ensures that the minority party has equal rights and privileges to engage and participate in all aspects of the process so that the American people know the true facts. Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy recently requested that Speaker Pelosi suspend the impeachment inquiry until she answered questions regarding the establishment of equitable rules and procedures  something that has been done in previous impeachment inquiries. Speaker Pelosi has continued to operate in the dark and refused to answer Leader McCarthys line of questioning about establishing fair and transparent procedures. This process is damaging to the American people and is an afront to fundamental fairness. The Speakers actions have been carried out in an illegitimate way that violates basic fairness and lacks due process. \"This week, Speaker Pelosi announced that she will not bring legislation to establish guidelines for this impeachment process to the House floor for a vote. Instead, House Democrats are choosing to hide facts from the American people and continue this opaque impeachment process. In doing so, House Democrats are overlooking the opportunities the American people have given us to help them by working in a bipartisan manner on the issues that hardworking American families care about most. America deserves better than the anti-Trump focused tunnel vision the radical left demands.\" ### Unsubscribe: ","district":"17","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"TX","party":"Republican","score":4.319087},{"name":"Congresswoman Elise Stefanik","address":"NY21ESima@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-18","subject":"Weekly Update: Promoting Legislation Against Alzheimer's; Passing\r\n Turkey Sanctions Bill; Standing with Hong Kong; Meeting with Advocate Drum","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                    October 18, 2019               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Co-Leading Amendment to Promote Medical Breakthroughs Against Alzheimer's   This week, I spoke in the Education and Labor Committee during the Markup of H.R. 3, and offered an amendment to promote medical breakthroughs in the ongoing fight against Alzheimer's, by excluding drugs used to treat or cure the disease from the list of drugs the Health and Homeland Security can select for government price controls. With one in four Americans struggling to afford their medications, it is incumbent on members of Congress to push for bipartisan solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs for patients and families. My amendment ensures ongoing research to end Alzheimer&#8217;s disease for patients and families will not be endangered or stifled by H.R. 3. Watch my full remarks here.&nbsp;  Passing Legislation&nbsp;to Impose Sanctions Against Turkey  This week, I joined&nbsp;House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney and over 90 of my Republican colleagues to introduce and pass legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey in response to Ankara&#8217;s military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in Northern Syria. After recently returning from a Congressional Delegation visit to Turkey, Afghanistan, and the Syria-Jordan border&#151;which included meetings with foreign government leaders and our own U.S. security and intelligence leadership, it is clear that terrorist groups still pose a serious threat to this region&#8217;s instability and our own national security. Any actions to increase the instability of Syria must be met with adequate consequence. That is why I support imposing sanctions on Turkey. While this is an important first step to prevent further instability in the region, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House Armed Services Committee to continue to work together to develop a long-term strategy. Read the full text of the legislation here.  Standing with Hong Kong  In this new era of great power competition, authoritarian regimes seek to undermine democracies and suppress human rights. Hong Kong&#8217;s cry for democracy is being stifled by China. I was proud to support their voice and pass 3 bills this week to recognize &amp; protect Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act directs various U.S. agencies to assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and protected rule of law. The Protect Hong Kong Act will bar the Hong Kong Police from using tear gas, pepper spray, and batons on those protesting unjust treatment and asserting their right to freedom. The Resolution to condemn China's interference in Hong Kong's affairs and support the right to protest calls on Hong Kong's government to begin negotiations to address the protester's demands. America stands with Hong Kong, and the values of freedom, democracy, and self-governance. The actions of the Chinese government are criminal, indefensible, and will not be tolerated. I was proud to vote in support of these bills, and for the people of Hong Kong.&nbsp; Announcing Funding for Town of Potsdam  This week, I announced a $3,125,000 Water and Environmental Program Grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the town of Potsdam.&nbsp;They will receive an additional loan totaling $1,657,000. The project includes a 200,000-gallon water storage tank that will be included to provide the average daily demand of 22,500 gallons as well as fire flows for the users along the proposed Rt 56 water district. It also services individuals who currently have individual dug or drilled wells. I am excited that USDA has awarded this significant funding to Potsdam to support these upgrades and new construction of a distribution system. I am proud to continue to be a strong advocate for the rural development of our region. Read more about the grant here.  Announcing Adaptive Sports Program Grant for Lake Placid   On Wednesday, I announced a United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) grant to benefit Veterans with disabilities and disabled members of the Armed Forces. Grants may be used to fund, develop, and implement adaptive sports programs including equine therapy, cycling, kayaking, and hiking. 126 grants totaling $14.8 million were awarded to national, regional, and community programs, including one in Lake Placid.&nbsp;I am excited&nbsp; that the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, located in Lake Placid, has been awarded funding to support disabled veteran&#8217;s recreational and community-based activities. All veterans are valued members of our communities and deserve opportunities to thrive both mentally and physically. I am proud to be an outspoken supporter for initiatives to help our veterans live fulfilling lives. Read more about the grant here.  Meeting with Advocate Drum and NAICU      This week, I had a great meeting with Advocate Drum, where they presented me with an award recognizing my work in Congress to support Fort Drum.&nbsp;Their mission is critical to our national security. I am proud to continue to be a strong advocate for Fort Drum, and all of our veterans and military families, here in Congress.&nbsp; I also met with the President of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities to talk about my work on the Education and Labor Committee, and the importance of independent colleges in our district. They presented me with a plaque of the \"Member Spotlight\" I participated in recently. You can read that here.&nbsp;  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!

Elise Stefanik on Wednesday addressed the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats and Capabilities to discuss the inadequacies she said she perceives in military infrastructure when it comes to climate change and technology. The Republican representing northern New York also joined 90 Republican Congress members in voting to introduce sanctions against Turkey, a fellow NATO member, for its aggression against U.S. allied Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria, which began after President Donald Trump, against the advice of his Pentagon and State Department officials, removed U.S. troops from Syria last week, clearing the way for Turkey&#8217;s invasion. Trump&#8217;s troop removal has been unpopular across Congress, and on Wednesday Stefanik also voted for a resolution opposing the troop withdrawal, which passed. Stefanik wrote on Twitter that she is&nbsp;&#8220;deeply opposed to the Administration&#8217;s decision.&#8221; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Stefanik was recently part of a congressional delegation that visited Turkey, Afghanistan and the Syrian-Jordanian border to meet with foreign governmental leaders and U.S. security, intelligence and diplomatic leadership. &#8220;It is clear that terrorist groups still pose a serious threat to this region&#8217;s instability and our own national security,&#8221;&nbsp;Stefanik wrote in a press release Wednesday.&nbsp;&#8220;Any actions to increase the instability of Syria must be met with adequate consequence.&#8221; The Trump administration sanctions include an exception for foreign military sales. Congress&#8217; proposed sanctions are tougher, banning U.S. military assistance to Turkey &#151; in finances, materiel or technology &#151; and banning any foreign person or entity who knowingly conducts one of those transactions with the Turkish military. Sanctions also apply to many of the highest-ranking Turkish officials.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; _________________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

During the open enrollment season, all Medicare customers can change their health plans and prescription drug coverage for the following year to better meet their needs. If you're over 65 (or turning 65 in the next 3 months) and not already getting benefits from Social Security, you need to sign up to get Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). You won't get Medicare automatically.&nbsp; Medicare beneficiaries can use the new Medicare Plan Finder&nbsp;to review their coverage choices and decide on the options that best fit their health needs for 2020. The redesigned Medicare Plan Finder makes it easier for beneficiaries to:  &#149; Compare pricing between Original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug plans, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policies; &#149; Compare coverage options on their smartphones and tablets; &#149; Get plan costs and benefits, including which Medicare Advantage plans offer extra benefits; and &#149; Build a personal drug list that is more accurate and find Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage that best meets their needs.  The new Plan Finder is just one of several resources available to support Medicare beneficiaries with decisions about their coverage options.&nbsp; Information on coverage options is also available through 1-800-MEDICARE, the State Health Insurance Assistance Program, the Medicare &amp; You handbook, or consultations with a trusted agent or broker.&nbsp;  As always, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my&nbsp;District Office staff at 301-354-1000.&nbsp;   All Best,    Dates to Remember  October 15th &#150; December 7th&nbsp;- Medicare Open Enrollment  Within this time period Medicare recipients can change their Medicare health or prescription drug plans.

Some of the things we did this past week were:&nbsp;   I announced my co-sponsorship of a bill to establish a National Heritage Area (NHA) in Northeast Florida. NHAs promote cultural, natural and historic sites of importance in Northeast Florida and will boost our local economy. I spent time in our community, met with local organizations and businesses and went undercover as a United Sates Postal Service mail carrier.&nbsp; I discussed the Turkish invasion of Syria and my bill to impose sanctions on Turkey with America&#8217;s Newsroom.

In service,   Michael Waltz  NATIONAL HERITAGE AND NORTHEAST FLORIDA:&nbsp;Northeast Florida is one of the most beautiful, most historic areas in our country. Last week, fellow Florida Reps. John Rutherford, Al Lawson Jr. and I announced new legislation to make Northeast Florida a National Heritage Area. The Nation&#8217;s Oldest Port National Heritage Area Act will preserve our history, environment and bring tourism and jobs to our communities. We'll be working hard to get this bill passed very soon!&nbsp;   Meeting with a representative of the St.&nbsp;Augustine Lighthouse&nbsp;&amp; Maritime Museum, where Rep. Rutherford and I announced the Nation&#8217;s Oldest Port Heritage Area Act  FACETIME IN FLORIDA: One of my favorite parts of being your Congressman is visiting with people like you, learning more about local businesses and sharing all our community has to offer. This week I visited Super Petrel USA&nbsp; in Ormond Beach and flew in one of their amphibious test planes&nbsp;over the Halifax River, met with local veterans at the Daytona Beach Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic, discussed the&nbsp;Institute for Water and Environmental Resilience with Stetson University President Wendy Libby and spoke at the Tiger Bay&nbsp;Club of Volusia County.   Going on a test flight over the Halifax River in the&nbsp;Super Petrel Light Sports Biplane   Visiting a centenarian veteran of World War II and the U.S. Army Air Corps   Speaking at the Tiger Bay Club of Volusia County  UNDERCOVER CONGRESSMAN:&nbsp;If you live in Holly Hill, I may have delivered your mail last week! For the latest episode of Undercover Congressman, I joined the United Sates Postal Service as a mail carrier! I learned all about the hard work that goes into delivering mail to our community, rain or shine! There are over 340,000 mail carriers in the U.S. Did you know that 100,000 of those are veterans and 40% of mail carriers are women? I love visiting local businesses and living a \"day in the life\" of my constituents. So far, I've delivered packages with UPS, served chicken sandwiches and waffle fries at Chick-fil-A, dipped ice cream for customers at Dairy Queen, hand-tossed pizza dough at Giuseppe's Steel City Pizza and delivered mail with the USPS.

Liz Cheney in the House and Lindsey Graham in the Senate on bills imposing sanctions on Turkey. The decision to withdraw our specialized forces in Northeastern Syria is an enormous risk for our national security because now our Kurdish allies have no support to fight ISIS. Instead, they are fending off the Turks and ISIS prisoners are escaping as we speak. I'm very troubled by the situation in Syria. With more ISIS fighters on the loose, we could easily see a resurgence of terrorism and an ISIS 2.0 following us home. I'm working with Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Lindsey Graham on a sanctions package to punish Turkey for invading Northeast Syria. We must show support for our Kurdish allies and do what we can in Congress to stop Turkey's aggression in Syria.&nbsp;   Click below to watch me discuss Syria and sanctions against Turkey in full:    &nbsp;  As a reminder, please follow my daily work on social media by&nbsp;liking my&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;page, and&nbsp;following me on&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram.&nbsp;As always, feel free to reach out to my offices in Florida or Washington, D.C. if we can ever be of service.

The Open Enrollment period occurs annually to give beneficiaries the chance to reevaluate your current healthcare coverage and determine whether it is still the best plan for you and your family. Your benefits may be changing for next year so be sure to carefully review any notices from your plan. Additionally, each year brings new health coverage options that may have better coverage at lower costs.  Now is the time to compare the plans available, and shopping around could mean extra savings for you and your family!  Medicare Enrollment: October 15, 2019 - December 7, 2019 If you are 65 or older, you most likely qualify for Medicare coverage. The Medicare Open Enrollment period will run from now through December 7, 2019. The Medicare Open Enrollment period gives you the chance to switch to a new plan that fits all of your healthcare needs. For instance:   You may wish to switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage, or vice versa, after examining coverage benefits; Beneficiaries may wish to switch from one Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plan to another after comparing pricing; or Beneficiaries who have yet to enroll in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan may wish to enroll now.  There are a number of resources available to help you and your family find the best coverage that meets your unique healthcare needs:   Visit the newly updated Medicare Plan Finder (available online here)&nbsp;to learn about and compare coverage options and shop for health and drug plans. If you need help navigating the new site, please watch the official overview of the site for a quick tutorial (watch the video here); Look at your most recent &#8220;Medicare &amp; You&#8221; handbook (available online in English and Spanish here).

Covered California (ACA) Enrollment:&nbsp;October 15, 2019 - January 15, 2020 This year, Covered California is offering additional subsidies to qualifying individuals and families to reduce premiums costs. Specifically, individuals earning up to $74,940, couples earning up to $101,460, and families of four earning up to $154,500 are now eligible for premium assistance if you purchase a plan through the marketplace. This means that approximately 229,000 more Californians are newly eligible to receive subsidies to bring down the cost of their monthly premiums. Additionally, Covered California indicates that &#8220;customers who shop around when enrollment for 2020 plans opens on October 15 could reduce their premiums by as much as 16.5%.&#8221;  There are a number of resources available to help you and your family find the best coverage to meet your unique healthcare needs:   Visit Covered California online at  to compare plans and explore assistance that is available; Call Covered California&#8217;s Service Center at (800) 300-1506.

People say with age comes more wisdom and more kindness - and a lot of wrinkles and grey hair.* As the stories we tell our kids get longer and longer, our memories get shorter and shorter. *But as a famous American architect once said, \"The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes.\" *Every day, I make it a top priority to ensure our nation's elderly and veterans are cared for.* I have worked tirelessly to protect Social Security and Medicare for our current seniors while strengthening it for future generations. I've worked to lower drug costs at the pharmacy counter and I am committed to ensuring you can access affordable, high-quality health care. *I have consistently been recognized as a \"Guardian of Seniors' Rights\" by leading seniors' groups for my work to keep our promises to today's seniors and future generations while cutting wasteful government spending.* I continue to fight for reforms to save your tax dollars over the long term and pave the way for a Medicare system that promotes higher quality care for seniors while strengthening the doctor-patient relationship. Last year, I was proud to support the *Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2017* (H.R. 4547) to improve protections for the millions of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on a representative payee to administer their monthly benefits. *President Donald Trump signed the bill into law, and we've made good progress, but there is still much more work to do.* I'm glad to see this Administration continue to put caring for our nation's seniors at the top of the to-do list. [image = President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order to strengthen Medicare. *On October 3, President Trump doubled down on that commitment by issuing an executive order to protect and improve Medicare for our nation's seniors. *In his announcement, President Trump said he will continue to build on aspects of the program that work well, including the market-based approaches in the current system. The executive order will allow seniors more choices to pick a plan that fits their needs. Additionally, it will eliminate excessive billing requirements and allow doctors to spend more time with patients. *By doing this, we will help empower patients to select and access the right care, at the right time, in the right place, from the right provider.* As a nation, another promise we've made is to honor the service and sacrifice of our nation's service members.* Last week I was fortunate enough to honor a World War II soldier and present his sister the awards he earned in service. *Private First Class (PFC) Raymond Vick was killed in action in Worms, Germany during WWII when his sister, Jean Brady, was just 8 years old. I was able to track down his WWII Victory Medal and the WWII Honorable Service Lapel Pin after they were lost for 74 years.

I join my colleagues, friends, neighbors, and constituents in recognizing the history, culture, and achievements of these communities.  As we approach the close of Hispanic Heritage Month this Tuesday, October 15th, I wanted to share with you a brief update about how I've recognized Hispanic Heritage Month across the District -- check it out below! As always,&nbsp;I encourage you to connect with me directly on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Stay close and take good care.  All Best,    &nbsp; &nbsp;  Recognizing Latino/a/x Students in the District  In recognition of Hispanic Heritage Month, I recently hosted my second annual Award Ceremony for Latino/a/x high school students from across the District. I was proud to recognize 29 amazing students, who were nominated by their school principals for their exemplary commitment to community service, leadership, and academic excellence. Thanks to my District Caseworker Erica Fuentes for her work in organizing this event.        Congressman Raskin presents congressional citations to Latino/a/x students at his second annual award ceremony.    Recognizing Latina-Owned Businesses in the District  I enjoyed meeting business owners Maria Duran of the newly-opened Maria&#8217;s Cafe and Maria Peredo of Unplugged Restaurant and Sports Bar last week in Wheaton, MD.  Our state's thriving small business community depends on hardworking entrepreneurs and their families!        Rep. Raskin presents a congressional citation to Maria Duran at the newly-opened Maria's Cafe.    &nbsp;    Expressing Solidarity With Immigrants in the District        I was proud to stand in solidarity with all our neighbors in Frederick, MD this weekend, where we celebrated the strength of our community and a nation that welcomes immigrants!          Rep. Raskin attends a community event in Frederick and speaks with constituents about federal immigration policy.                Rep. Raskin meets with a constituent in Frederick&nbsp; and talks about immigration policy in Congress.&nbsp;          Recognizing Young Latino/a/x Professionals in the District Lastly, I'm thrilled to share that my capable and talented Legislative Assistant Martha Sanchez was recently invited to appear on an award-winning Spanish-language television program, Linea Directa, to discuss her role in my office and the achievements of young Latino/a/x professionals in the National Capital Region.       Martha Sanchez on the set of Linea Directa.          This mailbox cannot receive replies. To email me, please click here.

This legislation has already provided over $175 million in grants for local communities to invest in early intervention programs, better connect law enforcement and administrators, and secure schools. Every student deserves to feel safe while they are at school, and every parent deserves the peace of mind that comes from knowing we have done everything in our power to create a safe environment for their children to learn.&nbsp;     Protecting First Coast Treasures   On Monday, I joined&nbsp;Representative Michael Waltz&nbsp;at the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum to announce our introduction of legislation to designate a National Heritage Area in Northeast Florida. This designation would provide federal support for historic preservation, natural resource conservation, recreation, and heritage tourism. St. Augustine and the entire First Coast is home to countless places of historical significance. From rich Native American and African American history to the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in the United States, Northeast Florida&#8217;s cultural heritage sites are deserving of this national recognition that will ensure they exist for future generations. Learn more here.&nbsp;  &nbsp;      Veterans Deserve All Care Options   Today I joined Representative TJ Cox (CA-21) to send a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs to ask for more information on the VA&#8217;s long-term care plans, including assisted living programs, for veterans living with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Veterans who have suffered severe TBI often face challenges with finding adequate care when they return home. This is especially true for assisted living, since traditional assisted living facilities typically cater to an older population with different mobility and physical fitness levels. After America&#8217;s servicemembers go abroad to fight for us, many return home with physical and psychological wounds of war. As our warfighters seek treatment and return to civilian life, all options for care must be available to them. This includes VA supported assisted living facilities for younger veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury. Learn more about this effort here.&nbsp;  &nbsp;      Snapshot: Recent Photo Highlights   I had a great time at the historic St. Augustine Lighthouse! I recently introduced legislation to preserve historical landmarks like the Lighthouse throughout the First Coast.    I enjoyed meeting with some of our local postal carriers who are members of the National Association of Letter Carriers. We discussed the ways our postal carriers serve our community and how we in Congress can support the important work done by our postal workers.  &nbsp;     Stay Connected As your voice in Washington, it is important that I hear from you. I want to hear your ideas and opinions, and I hope to keep you informed on what is happening in Congress. You can visit my&nbsp;website&nbsp;for press releases and recent news, and follow me on&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;to find out how I&#8217;m fighting for the people of Northeast Florida.

We met with dozens of former service members and the dedicated professionals in the community who help serve them to discuss the opportunities and challenges they face and how we can help them in Washington. As a Marine and the father of a Marine, I take this responsibility very seriously.&nbsp; Here's a quick recap of my tour and the work I&#8217;m doing in Congress to ensure our veterans get the care, benefits, and services they deserve.   Getting Results for Our Veterans In Congress, there should be no bigger priority than caring for the men and women who selflessly sacrificed for our freedoms.&nbsp; In my role on the House Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee and the senior Republican on the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, I have had a unique opportunity to lead on issues important to our veterans.&nbsp; There will always be more we can do, so my mission will never cease to give back to the veterans of the United States. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s some recent developments that may be of interest to you or someone you love:     Welcoming Our Veterans Home I was honored to welcome home Southern Illinois veterans who took part in last week&#8217;s Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. Every year, Honor Flight of Southern Illinois, a non-profit organization, provides all veterans who apply a free trip to our nation&#8217;s capital to visit the many memorials and honor the service they have given to our country. I am grateful for the opportunity that this organization gives to the men and women who have selflessly served the United States. Programs like the Honor Flight allow us to give back to our veterans, and I am proud to have been a part of it.     Getting Feedback from Veterans in Caseyville Dr. Roe and I hosted a free, public veterans forum at the Caseyville Memorial VFW Post 1117. It was a great opportunity to answer questions and receive feedback from veterans who wanted to discuss VA benefits, veterans&#8217; homelessness, personal casework issues, and developments in Washington. &nbsp;We had a great turn out and appreciate all those who were able to make it.     Visiting the Marion VA Medical Center During our visit to the Marion VA Medical Center, we met with the executive staff and employees to answer their questions and hear what they have been doing to help veterans in Southern Illinois. It was good to get an update on their work and hear about the direction they are going in to take care of our vets.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Stopping By the John Cochran VA Hospital Dr. Roe and I were joined or our visit to the John Cochran VA Hospital in St. Louis by Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) to get an update on the progress they have been making. This hospital has made great strides over the last few years, and is now recognized as one of the nation's top VA hospitals. The John Cochran Hospital uses innovative technological advances to provide quicker services to veterans and save taxpayer dollars. It was also selected as one of the flagship sites for the new VA Whole Health Program, which will help veterans develop personal health plans that best fit their needs. I was also pleased to find out that over the last few years, over 700 new staff members have been added, cutting wait times and ensuring those who served do not have to wait for the treatment they need.     Talking Healthcare with Doctors in O'Fallon Dr. Roe and I also hosted a health care roundtable with physicians and administrators at St. Elizabeth&#8217;s Hospital in O&#8217;Fallon to discuss veterans&#8217; health services, issues impacting patient access to care, and the unique needs of healthcare in our community.&nbsp;  Many of the issues we discussed were focused on patient to access to care and costs.&nbsp; Addressing the opioid crisis, including the need to promote better access to mental health care, featured prominently as well.&nbsp; Physicians also expressed concerns about the increasing practice of insurance companies requiring prior authorization before providers can deliver services to patients for certain procedures.&nbsp; Currently, Congress is working on legislative proposals to address the need to streamline and rationalize the prior authorization process and is continuing to implement legislation I supported to help those who fall victim to opioid addiction.&nbsp; &nbsp;     With all of the chaos currently happening in Washington, it reinforces for me why it&#8217;s so important that I continue to come home every weekend and use my time in the district meeting with and hearing from the people I represent.&nbsp; It keeps me grounded and forever tied to our Southern Illinois values.&nbsp; Whether you&#8217;re a veteran or not, I am honored to be your voice in Washington. I thoroughly enjoyed last week&#8217;s veterans&#8217; tour, and I look forward to similar events in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;  -Mike                    WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 1440 Longworth HouseOffice BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-5661Fax: (202) 225-0285 O'FALLON OFFICE 302 West State St.O'Fallon, IL 62269Phone: (618) 622-0766Fax: (618) 622-0774 CARBONDALE OFFICE 300 East Main StreetSuite 4&nbsp;Carbondale, IL 62901Phone: (618) 457-5787Fax: (618) 457-2990          Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window | Click here to open a plain text version of this email Unsubscribe&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;          ","district":"12","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Republican","score":3.6597533},{"name":"Donald Payne","address":"NJ10DPima@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-01","subject":"Update from Congressman Payne, Jr. (May - September 2019)","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }      p { margin-bottom:1em; }     News from Representative Payne Jr.                        &nbsp;  Serving You  Media Center  &nbsp;              Update from Congressman Payne, Jr.  Dear Friends, Fall is here and it is great to be back to work.&nbsp; I enjoyed all the events I was able to attend, friends I was able to see, and new residents I was able to meet in the district during the summer recess.&nbsp; Now that we are back in session,&nbsp;I wanted to update you on the actions I&#8217;ve taken, and continue to take, to make life better for all of us in the 10th District.  Presidential&nbsp;Impeachment: Reviewing President Trump's actions in office  My office received dozens of calls from angry constituents who support the impeachment of President Trump after press reports detailed Trump's threat to withhold foreign aid from Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky conducted a baseless investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.&nbsp;  On September 24th, House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would conduct a full impeachment inquiry of&nbsp;President Trump's actions to determine whether they violate his oath of office.&nbsp; Personally, I believe there is enough evidence to pursue articles of impeachment against this president already.&nbsp; But I do fully support this inquiry in order to present the facts, so my&nbsp;House colleagues can reach their own conclusions.  I am proud to be one of the original supporters of Rep. Al Green's resolution,&nbsp;H. Res. 498, which called for the impeachment of&nbsp;President Trump on July 17, 2019.    &nbsp;  Newark&#8217;s Water Crisis: Providing clean water to Newark's residents  I am extremely concerned about the elevated levels of lead found in Newark&#8217;s drinking water.&nbsp; After all, my family and I drink this water with the rest of the city's residents. The health and safety of constituents is my #1 priority. Right now, my team and I are working with city, state and national officials to&nbsp;help do what needs to be done to get lead out of the water.  But I wanted to see the issue personally, so I volunteered to help my constituents get clean water at two local distribution facilities.&nbsp; I was grateful to the staff at the Bo Porter Sports Complex and Boylan Street Recreation Center for what they do on a daily basis to help our community.&nbsp; I enjoyed meeting with my constituents to hear their concerns about this crisis.&nbsp;        Congressman Payne, Jr. chats with residents and helps distribute bottled water.    We talked about their fears of living with tainted water.&nbsp; I told them what I am doing to help, but also asked them if there were any other actions I could take to&nbsp;make sure a tragedy like this one doesn't happen again. There are many actions I've taken to try and solve the issue.&nbsp; I introduced the Test for Lead Act in Congress already.&nbsp; I co-signed and sent two letters: one to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (find it here) to urge them to provide more assistance to Newark and the other to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (find it here) to expand access to SNAP and low-income food subsidies to cover the additional costs of bottled water.&nbsp;  In addition, I&#8217;m working with my colleague Rep. Grace Napolitano,&nbsp;chairwoman of the Committee of Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment,&nbsp;to find out how we might be able to help the city with federal funding or other resources.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;I&nbsp;voted for&nbsp;legislation in the House that would allow communities the freedom to adjust their budgets to&nbsp;provide additional resources to their water treatment facilities in the event of an emergency.&nbsp; The legislation passed both U.S. Senate and the U.S. House and it needs President Trump's signature to become law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe federal funds are appropriate because what has happened in Flint, MI. and Newark shows that lead contamination from old pipes are a national concern. There are dozens of major cities and small communities across the country that could use an upgrade regarding the way water gets from the aquifers to the household faucets. If we solve Newark&#8217;s water infrastructure issues, we create an example and template we can follow when other cities suffer the same fate. Job Fair for Veterans: Introducing veterans to future employers  More than 100 veterans participated in my annual job fair on August 7th, the largest turnout we&#8217;ve had. Next year, we are going to look at larger facilities&nbsp;in our district to attract even more veterans and the companies that want to hire them. I was excited and grateful to give back to the men and women who have given so much to this country.        An Amazon representative discusses a future career with a veteran (8/7/2019)    Disaster Preparation and Emergency Response: Making sure we are prepared before, during and after a crisis  Last July, I wanted to see if our district was prepared to care for the underserved and most vulnerable people of our community during an emergency. We&#8217;ve seen how changes in our climate have increased the intensity of hurricanes and other natural disasters across the country. I don&#8217;t want what happened in Puerto Rico and New Orleans after they were struck by hurricanes to happen to us.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery of the Committee on Homeland Security, I held a hearing on the matter on July 23rd called &#8220;Protecting Every Citizen: Assessing Emergency Preparedness for Underserved Populations.&#8221; The hearing was held at the Mac Mahon Student Center in Saint Peter&#8217;s University in Jersey City, so it could be accessible to my constituents. The hearing gave all of us a better understanding of the needs of underserved or vulnerable populations before, during, and after a crisis. It was extremely informative to hear from researchers, emergency responders, and community groups regarding&nbsp;how we plan for and meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens before, during and after an emergency.   Increased Manufacturing Base: Creating more manufacturing jobs for New Jersey&nbsp;  No area of our economy has suffered job losses like America&#8217;s manufacturing base. In August, I spoke with members of a local Machinists&#8217; union about how we can increase the opportunities for workers affected by these job losses. The event is important because it gives me an opportunity to listen as well as speak about possible solutions to the problems that face our workers and communities.        Rep. Payne speaks to Machinists' union (8/6/2019)    Legislation:  I have&nbsp;introduced or signed on to support several legislative initiatives. I wanted to give you a brief introduction to just a few of those measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Payment Choice: Giving residents the choice to pay in cash  Recently, I heard that more businesses are trying to get rid of cash as a form of payment for goods and services. Companies say it will make it easier for consumers. In truth, it will make it easier for companies to secure transactions, reduce the risk of crime, and speed up the process to serve more customers and make more money.  While I applaud the innovation behind these technological advances, we must remember that they aren&#8217;t always good for everyone. Nearly 25 percent of Americans don&#8217;t have access to digital forms of payments, including credit or debit cards. If we eliminate cash payments, we eliminate the only&nbsp;option for these consumers, including seniors and low-income residents, to buy their groceries and pay for other goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is why I teamed with fellow New Jersey delegation member Rep. Chris Smith to introduce the &#8220;Payment Choice Act of 2019.&#8221; This bill would protect cash as a form of payment and require retailers to give consumers the choice to pay with credit cards, debit cards, or cash. The New Jersey State Legislature passed a similar law this year. I want consumers here and across the country to still be able to pay for items &#8220;the old-fashioned way.&#8221;  Return of Local and State Tax Deductions: Returning tax money to Americans  President Trump&nbsp;put a limit on the amount of state and local taxes that workers could deduct from their federal income tax.&nbsp; His Tax Cuts and Jobs Act caps the State and Local Tax deduction, also known as the SALT deduction, to $10,000. Previously, there was no cap on deductions.  This is a major concern for me because it hit the middle&nbsp;and lower class residents in&nbsp;our community the hardest.&nbsp; My&nbsp;constituents averaged more than $17,000 in SALT deductions last year.&nbsp; On average, this current law will deny taxpayers an additional $7,000 per year in deductions.&nbsp; I am working to repeal it, so the hard-working families of our 10th District can get that money back in&nbsp;their pockets.  Donald Payne, Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act: Giving patients more payment options for treatment  My father, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Sr., died of colorectal cancer. Even though his cancer is a preventable disease, his cancer screening happened too late to catch it in time. Sadly, his case was not unique.        Donald Payne, Sr.    One out of every four Americans between the ages of 50 and 75 fail to get screened for this deadly disease. African-American men are particularly vulnerable. They are 20 percent more likely to get colorectal cancer and 45 percent more likely to die from it than white men. The American Cancer Society recently found that incidences and deaths due to colorectal cancer are even increasing in people younger than 50.  On June 4th, I testified before the House Ways and Means Committee about my&nbsp;bill, The Donald Payne, Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act, because it would address this issue directly. Until recently, there were only two methods for colorectal cancer screening: colonoscopy and stool tests. Fortunately, there is a new test that can detect the disease with a simple blood draw. It can be done during a lunch hour in any facility that can draw blood. This test has the potential to significantly increase screening and save countless lives.  Another big issue with colon cancer is how to pay to fight it. Right now, Medicare will cover the screening, but not the treatment. If doctors find cancer cells and a growth, they must wait until the patient recovers from the screening to ask if they want the cancer removed. My bill would provide Medicare coverage for all FDA-approved, blood-based tests for colorectal cancer screening and the treatment, if cancer is found. That way we can prevent what happened to my father from happening to other fathers nationwide.  SAFE Act of 2019: Making our elections safer and easier for voters  Nothing is more important to democracy than faith in the electoral system. This is why Russia is so desperate to hack and infiltrate our social media. They want to create distrust in our elections and our democracy.  I signed on to the SAFE Act to strengthen the security of our elections and the trust in our democracy. The Act will address election security concerns through grant programs and requirements for voting systems and paper ballots. Thanks to this act, the Election Assistance Commission will have several new responsibilities. It must award grants to states to replace certain voting systems, carry out voting system security improvements,&nbsp;find the best way to design a ballot, write instructions for how to use that ballot, and test the ease of use for future ballots. I believe these actions will make our elections safer and easier for voters.  Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2019: Denying airlines the right to overcharge passengers during a crisis  In September, I introduced the Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2019, legislation to prevent airplane ticket price gouging before and after disasters. Climate change has increased the number of natural disasters dramatically. When they hit, area residents have few options available to take shelter and find safety, particularly when they are stuck on an&nbsp;island. During the time of&nbsp;Hurricane Maria, major airlines&nbsp;significantly raised their ticket prices in Puerto Rico. Many citizens who tried to evacuate&nbsp;before or after that&nbsp;disaster were trapped because they couldn&#8217;t afford the outrageous costs. My bill would prevent such airline abuse in the future for all Americans.  Raise the Wage Act of 2019: Giving minimum wage workers the raise they deserve  We need to give our workers a raise to show our appreciation for&nbsp;the hard work and effort they&nbsp;put in every day.&nbsp; I co-sponsored this legislation because it would increase the federal minimum wage for regular employees over a seven-year period, tipped employees, and newly hired employees who are under the age of 20 years old.  The bill would increase the minimum wage every year for six years until it reached $15 per hour for regular employees.&nbsp; It would provide other increases for disabled employees as well as employees who receive tips as a substantial portion of their wages.&nbsp; A pay raise for these workers is long overdue.&nbsp; This legislation would give employees a living wage and increase economic opportunities in their communities.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Gateway Project Update: Pushing to rebuild bridges and tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey        Gateway construction area    In September, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing on federal grants for state infrastructure projects. The Gateway Program, which will replace decaying bridges and tunnels connecting New Jersey and New York, is the most critical infrastructure project in the country. The federal government promised to fund half of the total cost of the project and then began to backtrack on that promise.&nbsp; That agreement should be honored. During the hearing, I questioned the acting Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration on why they are holding up federal funding for the Portal North Bridge project when it is ready to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need this project funded and these improvements made immediately.  Constituent Correspondence: Responding to Constituent Concerns  The thousands of letters I receive from constituents are extremely important to me.&nbsp; During the time period from January 3 to September 30, 2019, I received 18,860 letters from constituents throughout the district about a variety of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Constituent Letters based on City of Origin&nbsp;   I appreciate your letters and your concerns about issues that affect our district.&nbsp; The most popular subjects were support for impeaching President Trump, support for the Dreamers and Promise Act, support for gun control regulation, support for the Climate Action Now Act, support for legislation to support the Green New Deal, support for the Equality Act, support for a ban on toxic pesticides, support for the Social Security Fairness Act, support for stronger rules against robocalls, and support for the Saving America's Pollinators Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;  In closing, it has been a busy time for legislative and district activities.&nbsp; These are but a few of the actions I&#8217;ve taken during the last few months to improve the health and prosperity of all my constituents. I hope you are having a great Fall and let me know how I can be of service in the future.  Sincerely, Donald M.

The Dean Stone Bridge is located on the Foothills Parkway in the Smokies. - I introduced legislation that will make it easier for Tennessee students to attend college. This proposal includes legislation that simplifies the dreaded FAFSA - the student aid form that Governor Bill Haslam called \"the single largest impediment to more students participating in Tennessee Promise.\" - The United States Senate confirmed President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia. *The whole world sings with Tennessee* [image = [link 1] *Click here [link 2]or on the above image to listen to my remarks.* I spoke on the Senate floor about Ken Burns' new film series, \"Country Music,\" which concludes this week on PBS. The first two hours of 'Country Music' were about the recordings of hillbilly music in 1927 at the birthplace of country music in Bristol, where the Tennessee-Virginia state line runs down the middle of Main Street. The rest of the episodes wind through a community called Boogertown in the Smoky Mountains, where Dolly Parton was born, to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, to Beale Street in Memphis. As a senator from Tennessee, I must confess my bias, but Burns' new documentary shows that the whole world sings with Tennessee. If you haven't already, consider watching these great films and learn more about Tennessee's country music history. [image = I was at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville not long ago and heard Will Duvall play a song he wrote called, \"The King of Country Music.\" It was good to have him in Washington this week where I got to hear him play that song again, and talk about the Music Modernization Act [link 3] - bipartisan legislation I introduced and President Trump signed into law to ensure songwriters are paid fairly. *Visitors to the Foothills Parkway will know Dean Stone's legacy* [image = If you want to see the best view of the highest mountains in the eastern United States, you'll drive the Foothills Parkway. The scene is so magnificent that it surprises even those of us who have grown up admiring the Smokies. This parkway is also home to one of the most beautiful bridges in America, and, this week, it was named after a good friend of mine and of the Great Smoky Mountains - Dean Stone. For those who don't know Dean, he was the long time editor of *The Daily Times* in Maryville, and a lifetime advocate for the Great Smoky Mountains. Dean did as much as anybody to make the Foothills Parkway happen. He enthusiastically celebrated the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and was the best historian of what I like to call the \"Oak Ridge Corridor\" that we ever knew. As East Tennesseans know, we all love stories about ourselves, and Dean could tell them. It is now my hope that the naming of this bridge will tell the story of Dean Stone. [image = It was good to visit with some folks from Nissan this week. The auto industry has done more for our state the last forty years than anything else and has been the number one driver of higher family incomes. *Introducing legislation to make it easier for Tennesseans to attend college* This week, I introduced a long-term solution to permanently provide funding for Minority Serving Institutions, including the six Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Tennessee. This solution is part of a package of eight bipartisan higher education bills drafted by 35 senators - 20 Democrat, 15 Republican. This package of bills will make it easier for millions of students to get a college education by simplifying the Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) - which according to former governor, Bill Haslam, is \"the single biggest impediment to more students enrolling in Tennessee Promise.\" It would also provide Pell grants to parole-eligible prisoners, allow Pell grants to be used for short-term programs and increase the maximum Pell grant award. *Confirming Eugene Scalia to serve as U.S. Secretary of Labor* [image = This week, the Senate labor committee I chair approved the nomination of Eugene Scalia, President Trump's nominee to serve as Secretary of Labor. And Thursday, his nomination was confirmed by the full Senate. Mr. Scalia has the skills to help continue to grow our economy and help workers gain the skills they need to succeed in today's workplace. I am glad we have a well-qualified Secretary of Labor, so we can continue to create a strong economy for Tennesseans. *Read below about three of the five funding bills approved this week by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, and the impact they will have on Tennessee:* *Approving legislation that funds the border wall the right way* I support the president on border security, and I commend him for pursuing funding for the border wall in the right way - by asking the Congress for funding, allowing Congress to consider his request, and working with Congress to achieve a result. Congress has approved, for the last four presidents - Obama, Clinton, W. Bush and H.W. Bush - on a bipartisan basis, 654 miles of physical barrier - that's wall - along our almost 2,000 mile southern border. The bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee this week continues the work to secure our border by including $5 billion for the border wall system. When a president, elected by the people of the United States, has a legitimate objective, we in Congress should bend over backwards to try to meet that objective if we want a result, regardless of whatever you may think of him or her. This bill is now ready to be considered by the full United States Senate. *Approving more money to reduce the maintenance backlog at the Great Smoky Mountain**s **National Park* The Senate Appropriations Committee took a promising step to reduce the maintenance backlog at our national parks, including at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The funding approved this week will help restore the campgrounds, trails,and roads in what Ken Burns calls \"America's best idea\" - our national park system. The next step is to pass the Restore Our Parks Act [link 4], bipartisan legislation I introduced that would be the biggest help to our parks in a generation. Also included in this bill is money to help Tennessee protect its waterways from invasive Asian carp. Asian carp are aggressively invading Tennessee waterways and threaten biodiversity, the economy,and sporting from Memphis to Chattanooga. While the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency is working to combat Asian carp in the Tennessee-Cumberland Sub-basin, additional federal resources are needed. I was glad to support the $25 million in funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to combat this issue and protect commercial fishing and our nation's waters. *Approving funding to help Tennessee fight the opioid crisis* The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved a funding bill that provides $505 million for U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grants to help states, including Tennessee, tackle the opioid crisis. States could use these grants to help fund their drug courts, educational efforts, law enforcement programs, recovery programs, and treatment programs. Our law enforcement officers witness almost daily the tragedy associated with the opioid crisis, which effects virtually every American community. This funding will help give them the support they need to keep our communities safe. I was also glad to see that the $12 million I requested to fund meth lab cleanup was included in this bill. This will allow DOJ to continue to assist states in the very difficult and often dangerous efforts to clean up meth labs. According to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, between 2002 and 2012, Tennessee law enforcement agencies discovered more than 16,000 meth labs. While lab seizures are down, meth abuse continues to be a serious and deadly problem across Tennessee.

As we all know, there was a community tragedy in Farmington this month when a building exploded, apparently from a propane leak. The building housed a program for people with developmental disabilities. One firefighter was killed and seven others were injured.&nbsp; One small positive was that the building was unoccupied at the time of the blast, or the death toll would have been much higher. What this scene symbolizes is how we come together in times of need. The trucks are parked at the entrance to Farmington where the explosion took place, but if you look carefully you can see that each comes from a different neighboring town&#151;Jay on the right and Wilton on the left.&nbsp; People in Washington often ask me what&#8217;s so special about Maine, and I always have a one-word answer&#151;community. In many ways, Maine has the feel of a big small town (with very long streets) where people still know and care about one another, like in Farmington this week&#151;where a brave group of first responders put their lives on the line for the rest of us. Public Actions, not Private Assurances, Will Help Repair US-Saudi relations  &nbsp;  Trip to the Middle East with Senator Todd Young: At the beginning of September, Senator Todd Young and I traveled to Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, we met with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During our conversation with the Crown Prince, we made it clear that public actions &#150; not private assurances &#150; will repair the US/Saudi relationship.&nbsp; Saudi Arabia is a key counterweight to Iran, and as recent attacks on Saudi oil fields show, instability in the region ripples out to potentially disturb global peace and endanger American lives. Saudi Arabia is a valued security partner &#150; but not one we will support at any cost. Our visit showed positive advancements, but if the Crown Prince truly wishes to modernize his nation, there are a number of issues &#150; from women&#8217;s rights to the Kingdom&#8217;s conduct in Yemen to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi &#150; that must be addressed quickly and completely.   Senator King aboard the USS Gonzalez (built at Bath Iron Works)  Senator Young and I wrote an op-ed as a reflection of our trip to the Middle East. You may have first read it when it&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp; Defense News.  On Lobster Day, Celebrating our Industry and Addressing the Threats   I wrote the following op-ed celebrating National Lobster Day. It appeared in the Ellsworth American.&nbsp;  This week, we celebrate one of Maine&#8217;s most famous residents &#151; and no, I&#8217;m not talking about Stephen King or the couple who say &#8220;buttery flaky crust&#8221; in the Dysart&#8217;s commercial. Actually, this week marks National Lobster Day, when we celebrate not only our favorite crustacean, but all the men and women who help this industry and our state thrive.  Folks from away might not understand why we are celebrating the lobster, but Maine people know that this shellfish isn&#8217;t just a delicious meal &#151; it&#8217;s a vital part of our state&#8217;s economy, supporting communities up and down our coast. Maine people also know that even as we celebrate lobsters, this industry is facing serious challenges &#151; from well-intentioned but harmful potential regulations, to poorly designed foreign policy emanating from Washington, to the looming threat of warming waters due to climate change. So today, more than any other time in the past, it&#8217;s important to emphasize the value of this economic driver, and push back on the threats it faces.  One of the most pressing concerns facing our lobster industry is the danger of potentially misguided federal regulations to protect right whales. Now, let&#8217;s be clear: everyone, including lobstermen, wants to protect this endangered species. We just want to make sure we&#8217;re making changes based on sound data; and at this point, it is not clear that Maine&#8217;s lobster fishery is a significant contributor to right whale deaths. The possible changes threaten livelihoods and lives by calling for expensive and dangerous new equipment configurations. Even worse, these changes would disproportionately affect Maine lobstermen while not holding Canadian fisheries to the same standards.  I&#8217;ve been pushing hard with my Maine colleagues, asking everyone from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to the President himself to make sure we&#8217;re not moving forward based on incomplete data. I even made the argument directly to NOAA officials at an Ellsworth scoping session last month, where more than a hundred concerned people packed into the high school auditorium on a beautiful Tuesday night. The message from the community was unified: we&#8217;re prepared to make reasonable changes to protect this species, but show us the data.  These potential regulations are a serious problem on the horizon, but there is an existing Washington policy that is already harming our industry &#151; the President&#8217;s trade war. China was the fastest growing market for Maine lobsters, and lobster dealers spent a lot of time and money building relationships with Chinese buyers. But that all changed when the trade war started. Lobsters were one of the first products targeted by China for retaliation after the President started imposing his tariffs, and this has had a severe impact: through the first six months of this year, American lobster exports to China declined by more than 80 percent, and Canadian businesses have already seized the opportunity.  Maine people are paying the price for this reckless trade war. The drop in exports is costing jobs and undermining our state&#8217;s ability to build relationships in the Chinese market. Despite this pain, the administration refuses to compensate our industry while it provides bailouts for soybean farmers in Iowa. This is wrong &#151; Maine people did not start this trade war. They deserve to be made whole.  Of course, neither of these concerns will matter if there are no lobsters to catch. That is the threat posed by the warming of waters due to climate change. The Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming portion of the world&#8217;s oceans, a fact that will dramatically alter ecosystems and drive lobster populations farther north. We&#8217;ve already seen once-stable lobster fisheries in Rhode Island and Massachusetts collapse; we don&#8217;t want Maine to be next. I&#8217;m working hard in the Senate to address climate change, through everything from energy efficiency to renewable energies. It&#8217;s the right thing to do for our planet and for our economy.  The men and women who drive our lobster industry make vital contributions to Maine. They&#8217;re our lobstermen and lobster processors and dealers, who pull the lobsters out of the water and ship them across the state, country, and world; they work in our tourism industry that is boosted by this world-renowned fishery, and in our restaurants that serve unparalleled products fresh from the sea; they are our neighbors and our friends. When we celebrate National Lobster Day, what we&#8217;re really celebrating are our people and communities who help make Maine so special.  So, to all of you who make this vital sector of Maine go: thank you. Our state wouldn&#8217;t be the same without you, and I&#8217;ll keep working to defend your livelihoods, in ways both big and small (think emoji-sized), from anyone and anything that interferes with your work. Scenes from Maine &amp; D.C    This past Wednesday, September 25, was National Lobster Day &#150; a day to celebrate not only Maine&#8217;s most iconic industry, but also all the important people who work this fishery each and every day. During our Wednesday morning Capitol Coffee, we offered a traditional Maine lobster egg bake (along with our usual blueberry bread and Maine coffee!). &nbsp;  Later in the day, I was proud to honor the new home for the Maine Lobsterman statue in Washington, fittingly located right off Maine Avenue SW.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; I shared a great morning at the New England Council in Southern Maine, where we discussed some of my work with local leaders and heard about what they believe are the most pressing issues facing our state. It is a privilege to represent Maine people in the Senate, and I take my responsibility to speak on their behalf in Washington seriously. &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Climate change is one of my top priorities, and energy efficiency is an often overlooked but major tool to cut emissions; the cleanest (and cheapest!) kilowatt is the one we don&#8217;t use. This month, I spoke at the&nbsp;Alliance To Save Energy's event about how we can work together towards a cleaner future.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Legislative Update  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Worked to make the Annotated Constitution available to all Americans.&nbsp;To commemorate National Constitution Day, I sent a letter to the Library of Congress, urging to make the Constitution Annotated easily available to all Americans. The Constitution Annotated is compiled by the Library of Congress and details how the Supreme Court has interpreted each provision of the Constitution.&nbsp;Read more HERE. Advocated for family businesses in the logging industry. The Maine delegation&nbsp;led a bipartisan group of 16 members of Congress calling on the Department of Labor (DOL) to take action. Specifically, weurged DOL to grant a regulatory exemption that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to learn the logging trade under parental supervision.&nbsp;Read more HERE. Named to the 2019 NDAA Conference Committee to advocate for Maine and National priorities. I was&nbsp;appointed as a conferee to the House of Representatives and Senate conference committee charged with reconciling differences between the two chambers&#8217; competing versions of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Good News For Maine   $2 million for Gulf of Maine Lobster research&nbsp;This investment will&nbsp;support a range of research projects to advance our understanding of the American lobster as well as to support a regional lobster extension program. The projects being funded will address the following priorities: increased understanding of life history parameters, including migration, growth, and maturity; larval studies and early biology; spatial distribution; and socio-economic lessons learned from Southern New England as they pertain to Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine.&nbsp;&nbsp; $2 million to revitalize Maine's forest products industry. The Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) has awarded $2,004,673 to East Millinocket Industrials, Maine Development Foundation, and Northern Forest Center. $500,000 for rural economic development.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Economic Development Administration (EDA), a bureau within the U.S. Department of Commerce, has awarded $446,757 in federal funding to the Maine Development Foundation (MDF) to support and assist the economic efforts of rural Maine communities who have been negatively affected by mill closures.&nbsp;  In the News   Maine Public (Gratz) Angus King: Donald Trump Should 'Take A Deep Breath' Before Blaming Iran For Saudi Attack Reuters (Zengerle) Activists push U.S. Congress to pass Hong Kong bill CNN (Liptak) Trump's struggle with Iran policy continues without Bolton replacement The Hill (Kheel) Senators grill Army, Air Force nominees on military funding for border wall  Thanks for subscribing to my monthly newsletter!

It gave them great joy to work every day to help shape the future for our children. As a parent and grandfather, I feel the same joy watching my grandkids learn something new. &nbsp;  Last month, 1.7 million students across Georgia headed back to school. For them, unfortunately, the reality of going to school feels dramatically different than it did when I was younger.  &nbsp;  Over the last 20 years, many students across the country have directly experienced gun violence at their schools. Bulletproof backpacks and lockdown drills are now part of our children&#8217;s daily routine. It is every parent&#8217;s worst nightmare. For families in Newtown and Parkland, it is a nightmare that will never end. &nbsp;  In many of these tragic cases, bad actors were able to bypass security due to loopholes in the building&#8217;s design.  &nbsp;  What can we do to keep our kids safe? We can start by building schools that are designed to protect our children. As an engineer by trade, I have learned that building design is more than brick, metal, and wood &#150; it is the first line of defense.  &nbsp;  School design is not the only solution to making schools safer; we still have to find better ways to enforce existing law and keep guns out of the wrong hands. However, redesigning schools is an essential first step to keeping our kids safe.  &nbsp;  The problem is that many communities don&#8217;t have access to the knowledge or tools they need to build safer schools.  &nbsp;  Jay Brotman, lead designer of the newly rebuilt Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, has spoken about this at the White House. He said one of the biggest problems preventing local school officials from implementing new safety measures was &#8220;a lack of access to quality school-design information.&#8221;  &nbsp;  Now, Congress has the chance to fix this with a simple, commonsense step.  &nbsp;  I am proud to join senators Doug Jones, Thom Tillis, and Shelley Moore Capito in sponsoring the bipartisan School Safety Clearinghouse Act in the U.S. Senate. This bill will direct the Department of Homeland Security to build and maintain a national clearinghouse containing all the best practices and developments in school design. &nbsp;  The School Safety Clearinghouse Act will close the gaps preventing schools from finding the school design advancements they need to protect their students and faculty.  &nbsp;  It does so while also upholding a key doctrine of our Founding Mothers and Fathers: that decisions are best made by families, communities, and states &#150; not the Federal Government.  &nbsp;  The clearinghouse will have zero government mandates attached. It will advocate no political policies. Instead, it will act like a library that state and local officials can use to access the best practices when redesigning schools.  &nbsp;  That way, they are empowered to work with parents, teachers, and administrators to implement the school safety techniques that work best for their communities. These techniques aren&#8217;t government programs &#150; they are innovations coming from the free market of ideas. &nbsp;  Some of these innovations are physical, such as stronger glass and reinforced locks. Others are virtual, like state-of-the-art surveillance systems or mobile apps. Other innovations are procedural, like new emergency strategies and threat assessment programs. &nbsp;  The School Safety Clearinghouse Act will give state and local officials easy access to this information. That way, they will be able to give our kids the safe learning environments they deserve. &nbsp;  We have seen how rethinking building design has worked before.  &nbsp;  After the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1994, designs and security at federal buildings were modernized. Following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11th, 2001, everything from our airports to sporting venues were rethought to prevent lapses in safety. &nbsp;  Yet after years of tragic incidents, little has been done to make school design safer.  &nbsp;  The private sector is working hard to change that. State and local officials are working hard to change that. The bipartisan School Safety Clearinghouse Act will help them make that change possible so that we can better protect all of our children.  &nbsp;  David Perdue is a Georgia U.S. Senator.  &nbsp;  ###  &nbsp;                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        &nbsp;  ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"M","state":"GA","party":"Republican","score":4.741782},{"name":"Senator Jim Inhofe","address":"jim.inhofe@inhofe.enews.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-09-27","subject":"INHOFE INFORMANT: My Climate Hypocrite Awards","body":"James M. Inhofe, US Senator for Oklahoma * INHOFE INFORMANT: My Climate Hypocrite Awards* * In Honor of Global Climate Week* * * *It is easy to get swept up in the rhetoric of climate alarmists, but it's important to remember the facts. Climate alarmists are eager to tell Americans that they need to take radical action, including going vegan, ending air travel, not having children and eliminating fossil fuels and nuclear energy, but they aren't willing to back up their data or take the actions they prescribe to everyone else.* *This week, while the rest of the world discusses how to use the climate agenda to turn over our economic system to the federal government and international organizations, I served up a dose of reality by recognizing some of the most notable climate hypocrites.* * #5: Michael Mann* * [image = *To kick off Global Climate Week, it seems most fitting to first recognize Michael Mann, the architect of the discredited [link 1] 'Hockey Stick' graph who** tells people to believe the science but was implicated in manipulating data in Climategate and refuses to provide the data to back up his graph.* * #4: Former President Obama* * [image = *Despite stating '[r]ising sea levels threaten every coastline,' that didn't stop former President Obama from reportedly acquiring a 29 acre, $15 million ocean front estate on Martha's Vineyard. His actions clearly show he doesn't believe his own rhetoric, but this is all too common for elite, liberal climate doomsdayers who say one thing but do another.* * #3: Climate Conference Attendees* [image = *U.N. climate officials and Hollywood elites share some things in common - they both use fear to push their radical climate agenda while traveling the world on carbon-intensive transportation and telling everyone else to stay home. Make no mistake - their motivation isn't about saving the environment - it's about controlling our lives.* * #2: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* [image = *My number two spot goes to proud socialist and Democrat standard-bearer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is well known for bad ideas but also for climate hypocrisy. Despite claiming [link 2], 'The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change', she doesn't seem to have any problem frequently utilizing rideshare apps or airfare over \"eco-friendly\" public transit and walking. Her radical Green New Deal would put countless Americans out of work - it would end America as we know it - but AOC doesn't think twice about living lavishly in her luxury apartment building, taking a car one mile to work, and believing her $174,000 taxpayer-funded salary should be higher.* * #1: Al Gore* * [image = *Last, but certainly not least, Al Gore has earned the grand prize of America's greatest climate hypocrite. Whether it's Gore's chartered jets around the country or the fact [link 3] his home uses up to 34 times more energy than the average American household, he's never wavered in his calls for everyone else to, '...make [environmental] changes in their own lives.' The actual 'Inconvenient Truth' is his hypocrisy - it is beyond absurd but typical of Hollywood elites. * ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] Office Locations: Washington, DC Office: 205 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 -3603 Main: (202) 224-4721 Fax: (202) 228-0380 Tulsa, OK Office: 1924 S.

I was also grateful to have my good friend Shannon Sidney - who is originally from Russellville - in town. He brought the Mater Dei Football Team, which he coaches, for a visit! Safe travels back to the Natural State&#133;  The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the First Responders Passport Act (), the Southeast Asia Strategy Act (), the Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act (H.R. 2327), , which emphasizes the importance of the United States&#8217; alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea, , which reaffirms the United States&#8217; commitment to promoting the safety, health, education, and well-being of refugees and persons displaced by war, the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act (H.R. 3190), which imposes sanctions against current or former officials who are responsible for or who supported serious human rights abuses in Burma, the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (), which prohibits a federal banking regulator from penalizing a depository institution for providing banking services to a legal marijuana-related business, the Homeland Security Improvement Act (), the STEM Opportunities Act (), the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act (H.R. 335), the Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act (), the Unifying DHS Intelligence Enterprise Act (), the TSA Reaching Across Nationalities, Societies, and Languages to Advance Traveler Education Act (), which requires the TSA to develop a plan to ensure that TSA material disseminated in major airports can be better understood by more people accessing such airports, the Trusted Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration Act (), the Helping Families Fly Act (H.R. 3694), the Traveling Parents Screening Consistency Act (), the Counter Terrorist Network Act (), the Domestic and International Terrorism DATA Act (), the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act (), and the Joint Task Force to Combat Opioid Trafficking Act ().  This week, we didn&#8217;t see House Democrats bring the vital USMCA to the floor - instead, we witnessed them move forward with impeachment. Since 2016, the one constant in federal politics has been the unwillingness of the Democrat party to accept that Donald Trump was duly elected as the 45th president of the United States. It&#8217;s all they can think about. They boycotted his inauguration, pushed the Russia collusion narrative for months, and spent millions of dollars on federal investigations, only to be told that there was no collusion, no smoking gun. Not satisfied, they brought in Special Counsel Mueller to testify before Congress. The conclusion didn&#8217;t change, and all that was had was a political sideshow.  The Democrats couldn&#8217;t accept that conclusion - it didn&#8217;t fit their impeachment agenda. So, it was time to fuel the next scandal: the Ukraine investigation. They alleged that President Trump told the Ukrainian government that their military aid from the U.S. would be tied to their willingness to investigate Joe Biden for political gain. That's not what happened. Anyone with a knowledge of Eastern Europe would know that Ukraine has a history of corruption. The reference to the Bidens was in the context of fighting corruption - not as a precondition of aid. It&#8217;s a reasonable concern to discuss, and, as we saw from the transcript that was released, there was no quid pro quo.   But those facts don&#8217;t matter as Speaker Pelosi - in a bid to appease the socialist left wing of her caucus - announced that they will move forward with the impeachment process.  Our nation faces serious challenges. The needs of families and businesses are being overshadowed by political distractions. The American people want to see us address the debt, work on drug pricing, pass appropriation bills on time, and bring the USMCA to the floor. Instead, the rest of this year will be focused on conspiracies and impeachment. I truly hope we can get back to the people&#8217;s business very soon.  MEETINGS In between legislative business and the impeachment circus, I was able to have productive meetings with Arkansans to discuss issues ranging from education to national defense. On Monday, I met with representatives from McDonalds to discuss growing job opportunities. The next day, I sat down with Debbie Faubus-Kendrick, the Director of the Crawford County Adult Education Center. We had a great meeting discussing the importance of career and technical education and their Alternative Sentencing Program, where people on probation can work to earn their general education diploma. I was pleased to then welcome Seth Coulter, a physical therapist in Russellville, to discuss legislation that impacts his business and practice. I wrapped up the day by talking with the Head Start Association about the great and important work being done in early childhood education in the Natural State.  On Wednesday I spent the morning in a Budget hearing focused on our nation&#8217;s infrastructure. From the post roads outlined in the text of the Constitution to the development of the Transcontinental Railroad; from the creation of the interstate highway system to the evolution of our electric grid, Americans have continually shown that we are a nation of builders. Infrastructure is part of the core foundation that has created and moved the America we all know. During my remarks, I discussed how state and local authorities also need to have skin in the game if we are to keep pace with the needs of our communities. Arkansas has led the way on this front and made sure to make smart improvements. Whether it is through partnerships with states like Missouri to get funds to complete the critical Bella Vista Bypass, or Northwest Arkansas pooling resources to create and maintain what was just named the best airport in the state, Northwest Regional, or Governor Hutchinson&#8217;s highway funding plan, the message is clear: infrastructure cannot be built and maintained without continued state and local investment. After that, it was time for appropriations, where I joined a Transportation, Housing and Urban Development subcommittee hearing on how the FAA handles aviation certification. It was an important opportunity to delve into how the Boeing 737 Max crashes occurred, and how to make sure we prevent future incidents. As I reached the end of the day, I met with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, where I was updated on projects around the state of Arkansas. In other good news, the United States and Japan signed a trade agreement at the UN General Assembly to expand market access for U.S. exporters. The deal will benefit Arkansas&#8217;s farmers, ranchers, and producers. Increased market access for U.S. agricultural products, including beef, pork, and dairy, will support our economy and businesses. It&#8217;s another step forward in modernizing our trade policies, and I&#8217;m pleased to see us negotiating from strength. Securing new trade deals, as well as passing proposals like the USMCA, is critical to leveling the playing field for hardworking Americans.  On Thursday, I had the privilege of hosting the Springdale Robotics team, Root Negative One, at the Capitol. This amazing team of high schoolers will be headed to Dubai to participate in a global robotics challenge in October. I wish the best of luck to these hardworking young adults, including Meghan Boen, Kathlyn Bowden, Isaac Brown, Charles Cassady, James Cassady, Abigail Herrera, Sara Manos, Catalina Peterson, Chase Rainwater, and Gregory Samuelson! Shoutout to Coach Richard Cassady as well! I then met Fermin Sandoval, a Rogers high school graduate who serves in the U.S. Marines, and I appreciated hearing about his service. He was hand selected to be in the Marine One squadron as part of the President&#8217;s detail team. I hope you will join me in thanking this patriot for his service! &nbsp;  I finished out the week meeting with Jessica Hesler of Springdale and Lisa Neihouse of Fort Smith, two STEM teachers, to discuss STEM research and the importance of preparing our students for 21st&nbsp;century jobs.  Next week, I will be back in the Natural State. I am looking forward to bringing one of my colleagues from across the aisle, Rep. Derek Kilmer (WA-6), to show him everything Arkansas and the Third District have to offer.&nbsp;Remember to keep an eye on my&nbsp;website&nbsp;or check out my&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;pages to stay up-to-date with the latest news from the Third District and Washington.&nbsp;    From the front...

Senator Rick Scott at Concordia: Every Freedom-Loving Nation Must See China for What It Is &#150; An Adversary  Senator Rick Scott spoke at the 2019 Concordia Summit on the threat of China to the United States&#8217; national security. Excerpts of Senator Scott&#8217;s remarks as prepared for delivery are below; read his full speech HERE. &#8220;... It&#8217;s fitting that we&#8217;re here today in the shadow of the United Nations as they prepare to convene the 74th Session of the U.N. General Assembly.   Freedom-loving countries around the world face a crisis.   China&#8217;s growing influence, particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, presents a clear and present danger to the stability of world markets, to the security of the United States and our allies, and to the quest for freedom and democracy around the globe.   We MUST be clear-eyed about this.   China&#8217;s goal is to be the dominant world power. China believes that in order for them to be stronger, America and other freedom-loving countries must be weaker.&#133; &nbsp; Thankfully, this Administration is taking a stand against China, and it&#8217;s about time.&#133;  My goal is to shine light on this threat to the strength and security of the United States and our allies.   America&#8217;s role of fighting for freedom and liberty worldwide depends on it. The future of our children and grandchildren depends on it.   And I won&#8217;t stop fighting until America&#8217;s economic and political future is secure from the threat of Chinese influence.   I don&#8217;t want my grandchildren to worry about their future. We MUST make sure future generations have every opportunity to live in an America that stands for freedom and liberty here and around the globe.&#8221;   &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: President Trump Should Focus on Freedom Around the Globe at UN National Assembly  Ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement on the three topics he would like the President's speech to address: China, Iran and Venezuela. Senator Rick Scott&nbsp;said, &#8220;This week, the President has the unique opportunity to engage world leaders on a number of serious issues. The national security of the United States and the fight for freedom around the globe must be his top priority, as he addresses the UN General Assembly. I look forward to the President standing strong against China as trade talks continue, and emphasizing the threat of China&#8217;s growing influence across the globe. I also hope the President reiterates the importance of China honoring its commitments on Hong Kong&#8217;s liberties.  &#8220;The President must also address Iran&#8217;s recent acts of aggression and make it clear that these acts will not be tolerated. Now is not the time to ease up on Iran, and all European leaders should join us in holding Iran accountable. Finally, we must continue to do everything in our power to free Venezuela from Maduro&#8217;s ongoing genocide, and I look forward to all UN nations joining the U.S. in this fight.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott to Department of State: Do More to Highlight China Travel Advisory  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement calling on the Department of State to do more to highlight the risks Americans face when traveling to China. See the Department&#8217;s current China travel advisory HERE.  Senator Rick Scott&nbsp;said, &#8220;China is a national security risk. They are stealing our technology and using it against us. Every American should be aware of the threat to their privacy when traveling in China. While the Department of State posts travel advisories, they are buried deep within the Department&#8217;s website. These advisories correctly note that Americans&#8217; social media accounts are widely monitored, and hotel rooms, phones, cars, and computers could be monitored or accessed without our knowledge. However, the Department should do more to clearly highlight the significant privacy risks when Americans travel to China. American travelers deserve to know the risks of traveling to China well before considering any potential itinerary.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: China&#8217;s Investment in Iran Proves They Can&#8217;t Be Trusted  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement on China&#8217;s $400 billion investment in Iran amid Iran&#8217;s aggression against the U.S. and our allies. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Iran&#8217;s continued acts of aggression against the United States and our allies puts our national security and the stability of world markets at risk. Instead of denouncing these attacks, China is choosing to pour hundreds of billions into Iran&#8217;s economy. China is proving once again that they will do anything &#150; including prop up dangerous regimes &#150; to advance its mission to become the dominant world power. The United States and the international community must see China for what it is: an adversary. I&#8217;m glad the Trump Administration is taking a stand against China, but we can&#8217;t turn a blind eye to this. We can&#8217;t stop fighting until America&#8217;s economic and political future is secure from the threat of Chinese influence.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senator Rick Scott to Counterterrorism Experts: FBI Needs to Do More to Prevent Acts of Mass Violence  During a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Countering Domestic Terrorism, Senator Rick Scott asked counterterrorism leaders how the federal government, particularly the FBI, can work better with local authorities to prevent acts of mass violence.  Senator Scott has been seeking information on what steps the FBI has taken to address critical deficiencies in its handling of actionable intelligence on the perpetrators of acts of mass violence in Florida, including the tragic shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and Pulse Nightclub. See video from the hearing HERE or below.  &nbsp; &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Introduces Amendment to Grant TPS to Venezuelans, Reform Program  Senator Rick Scott introduced an amendment to Representative Diaz-Balart&#8217;s House-passed bill that would immediately grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans fleeing Maduro's regime. Following&nbsp;Senate Democrats&#8217; objection to his amendment, Senator Scott released the following statement.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s be very clear about what we just saw. Senate Democrats just came to the floor to object to my amendment that would grant TPS to Venezuelans and reform the TPS program. That&#8217;s shameful. It&#8217;s incredibly disappointing that my Democrat colleagues would stand in the way of a common-sense compromise. Republicans support it. The sponsor of the House-passed bill supports it. I believe the President would sign it.&nbsp;   &#8220;It&#8217;s clear that the Democrats don&#8217;t actually want to get anything done on this issue. Unfortunately, they&#8217;ve decided to use the Venezuelan community as a political prop instead of working with us to find a solution. Their rhetoric over the last few months was just political nonsense. Even though the Democrats stood up and blocked TPS for Venezuelans today, I will never stop fighting to support the Venezuelan community here.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Los dem&#243;cratas bloquean enmienda del senador Rick Scott para otorgar TPS a los venezolanos, reformar el programa  Luego de una objeci&#243;n por parte de los dem&#243;cratas del Senado a la enmienda del senador Rick Scott que inmediatamente otorgar&#237;a TPS a los venezolanos, el senador hizo la siguiente declaraci&#243;n.  El senador Rick Scott dijo: \"Seamos muy claros sobre lo que acabamos de ver. Los dem&#243;cratas del Senado simplemente vinieron a la sala para objetar mi enmienda que otorgar&#237;a TPS a los venezolanos y reformar&#237;a el programa de TPS. Es vergonzoso. Es incre&#237;blemente decepcionante que mis colegas dem&#243;cratas se interpongan en el camino de un compromiso de sentido com&#250;n. Los republicanos lo apoyan. El patrocinador del proyecto de ley aprobado por la C&#225;mara lo apoya. Creo que el presidente lo firmar&#237;a.  \"Es claro que los dem&#243;cratas en realidad no quieren hacer nada al respecto. Desafortunadamente, han decidido utilizar a la comunidad venezolana como instrumento pol&#237;tico en lugar de trabajar con nosotros para encontrar una soluci&#243;n. Su ret&#243;rica en los &#250;ltimos meses fue simplemente estrategia pol&#237;tica. A pesar de que los dem&#243;cratas se levantaron y bloquearon el TPS para los venezolanos, nunca dejar&#233; de luchar para apoyar a la comunidad venezolana &#8221;.&nbsp;Lea m&#225;s AQU&#205;.  &#151;  Senators Scott, Rubio, Cornyn, Cruz and Kennedy Introduce Bill to Simplify Disaster Assistance for Hurricane Victims  Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio, John Cornyn, Ted Cruz and John Kennedy introduced the Disaster Assistance Simplification Act. This legislation would prohibit the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from penalizing victims of qualified natural disasters who apply for, but decline, Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Florida faced multiple hurricanes throughout my time as Governor, and I saw firsthand the devastation faced by families, communities and businesses across the state. Following every storm, I would look back at what we can do better on the local, state and federal levels to help our communities recover. I&#8217;m proud to support the Disaster Assistance Simplification Act, which gets government out of the way by making it easier for business owners to begin recovering and rebuilding.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Rubio's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Introduces STEM Act to End Skyrocketing Higher Education Costs  Senator Rick Scott introduced the Student Training and Education Metrics (STEM) Act to force universities to take more responsibility when it comes to preparing students for successful careers. The STEM Act is the first proposal in Senator Scott&#8217;s plan to lower the cost of higher education and ensure graduates are prepared to get jobs.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Today, I am introducing the STEM Act &nbsp;to offer a solution to make higher education more affordable and ensure schools are preparing students for jobs. Just like I did as Governor of Florida, I&#8217;m working to make sure colleges and universities never raise tuition or fees on our students. My STEM Act eliminates all federal funding for institutions that raise tuition, requires standards and metrics for both for-profit and non-profit colleges, and holds colleges and universities accountable for a portion of student loans. The Democrats&#8217; plans to eliminate all student loan debt is a fairy tale that would only make bad behavior worse. Proposals to make everything free seems great, but would bankrupt families. We need to focus on real solutions to bring down the cost of higher education and make sure students are prepared for jobs.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.              Sen. Rick Scott: I&#8217;m Proposing Real Solutions to Bring Down Healthcare Costs for American Families  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for Modern Healthcare on his efforts to make healthcare more affordable for families across the nation.&nbsp;  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;My experience growing up has shaped everything I&#8217;ve done in my life and how I think about the world&#151;especially when it comes to issues like providing quality healthcare that families can afford. And at the end of the day, the best way to ensure access to quality healthcare for a family is to have access to good jobs.&#133;  Beyond that, there are some commonsense things we can and should get done right now to start bringing down healthcare costs.&#133;  To help reduce the burden of high drug prices, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and I have a proposal that would prohibit pharmaceutical companies that use federal tax dollars to develop their drugs from charging American consumers unreasonable prices for those same drugs.  Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and I are working to make sure pharmaceutical companies cannot charge Americans more than consumers in other industrialized countries for the same prescription drugs.&#133;  I&#8217;m also working to get rid of surprise medical bills that have devastated families across the country and to create a consumer-friendly database of prescription drug prices.&#133;  These aren&#8217;t earth-shattering ideas. They are real, simple solutions to bring down healthcare costs right now.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in Modern Healthcare HERE. &#151;  Sen.

That&#8217;s why Senator Doug Jones and I have introduced the bipartisan School Safety Clearinghouse Act.   Our bill would simply create a resource where state and local officials can find best practices for school security and design.   Ultimately, our bill would allow parents, teachers, and administrators to make informed decisions about the best ways to keep their schools and communities safe.  As a father and a grandfather, I believe there is no higher calling than to keep our schools and our children safe. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  P.S.

Supporting the Completion of NBAF, Relocation of USDA to Kansas City On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the&nbsp;FY2020 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies&nbsp;appropriations bill. From farmers and ranchers to researchers and veterinarians, this appropriations bill includes a number of measures to support agriculture across our state during an extremely tough time for the ag community. Many of my Kansas priorities are included in this legislation. The legislation includes measures to fully-fund the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan and provides the necessary resources for the USDA to relocate the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to Kansas City.  In addition, this bill includes measures to support the expansion of rural broadband and assist veterans in agriculture. I appreciate the Senate coming together in a bipartisan fashion to show our care, appreciation and support for our nation&#8217;s producers and all those who support this noble work. To read more on my priorities included in this bill, click&nbsp;here.  Hosting my Annual Service Academy Day On Saturday I hosted the annual U.S. Service Academy Day in Hutchinson. Throughout the day, prospective candidates interviewed with members of my Service Academy Selection Board, who submitted recommendations to me on who I should nominate to the United States Service Academies. These include the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  Service Academy Interview Day has consistently been one of my favorites, and the responsibility of nominating young men and women to our nation&#8217;s service academies is a task I take very seriously. The individuals we interview represent some of the best, brightest and most dedicated young people our state has to offer. Their willingness and desire to serve our country and attend such rigorous institutions is inspiring and makes me optimistic for the future of our country.  Thank you to the Cosmosphere Museum in Hutchinson for hosting us and to members of my 2019 Service Academy Selection Board who helped me make these challenging decisions. The 2019 Selection Board includes Bob Brock of Topeka; Myca Bunch of Garden City; Larry Burks, Sr., and Sean Ritchie of Wichita; Dennis Butler and Katrina Lewison of Manhattan; John Cluck of Wathena; Ardith Dunn of Satanta; Michael Farris of Altamont; Sue Givens of El Dorado; Robin Jackson of Hutchinson; Cheryl Kerns and Brian Kessens of Overland Park; Jayne Humphrey Pearce of Wallace; Rachael Pitchford of Dodge City; Halley Roberson of Oberlin; Mike Souder of Prairie Village; Sam Turner of Leawood; Ron Whitney of Emporia and Beth Wilson of Girard.  If nominated, applicants must then meet the individual admission requirements of each academy. The academies will make the final decision on who will receive an appointment of admission in early 2020. Those selected will enter the academies in June 2020.   A Pay Raise for our Troops This week, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense approved the&nbsp;FY2020 Department of Defense Appropriations Act.&nbsp;As a member of this committee, I was proud to have a number of Kansas priorities included in the legislation.  Specifically, the legislation includes plans to leverage the ability of Kansans to design and manufacture the future of our defense strategy, and support our men and women in uniform. I&#8217;m pleased to see our appropriations committee provide stability to those who protect our nation, and I look forward to supporting these provisions when we vote in the full Senate.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Meeting with Kansan and Best-Selling Author Candice Millard This week, Kansan Candice Millard was the guest of honor at the Library of Congress&#8217; Congressional Dialogue Series. Before a full room of Members of Congress and special guests in the library&#8217;s Great Hall, she discussed at length her book on the death of President James Garfield, which she compellingly argues was the result of medical malpractice. Candace also touched upon her works on Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill before fielding questions from the audience. Candice&#8217;s love of history and passion for our country were evident during her presentation. Following her time at the Library of Congress, I met with Candice and we discussed her work, her travels throughout the world and her home state of Kansas.    Working to Increase Housing Accessibility for our Veterans On Wednesday, I met with members representing the Wounded Warrior Project, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Blinded Veterans of America to discuss my bill, S. 2022,&nbsp;The Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019. This bill will expand the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) program and allow veterans to use this vital grant in a way that best fits their needs. My bill is named after Spring Hill, Kansas-native Colonel (Ret.) Paul Benne, who served 23 years in the Army before developing a medical condition that led to his retirement. Col. Benne has been confined to a wheelchair and used an SAH grant to renovate his home to accommodate for his disability. Ryan Kules, Tom Zampieri, and Shaun Castle are veterans I met with this week who benefit from an expanded SAH program. Thank you to these American heroes for their decades of selfless service to our nation and for their advocacy, resiliency and willingness to share their stories for the benefit of others. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to see more on this legislation.    Meeting with the National Bison Association On Thursday, it was great to meet with with the National Bison Association (NBA). The NBA represents members in all 50 states and from each segment of the bison industry. During the meeting, we discussed meat labeling, bison management and livestock hauling issues that are impacting bison producers. Each year, I cosponsor a Senate resolution marking National Bison Day to celebrate the important role bison play in our nation. I look forward to the Senate passing this resolution again this year and working with my colleagues on other efforts to support bison producers in Kansas.  &nbsp;  Discussing Rural Prosperity with Land O&#8217;Lakes CEO Beth Ford This week, I met with Land O&#8217; Lakes CEO Beth Ford to discuss issues facing farmer cooperatives and rural America. During the meeting, we discussed the importance of investing in rural broadband to make certain farmers and ranchers, as well as hospitals, schools and businesses in our rural communities, have access to the technology available today and in the future. I look forward to working with Land O&#8217;Lakes and other farmer cooperatives in assisting producers during these challenging times in agriculture.    Honoring 100 Years of the Aerospace Industries Association On Tuesday, my resolution with Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) to recognize the centennial celebration of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) unanimously passed the Senate. Congratulations to AIA on 100 years of advocating for the aerospace industry. Communities across Kansas understand the enormous impact this industry has on our state, and we&#8217;re proud of the countless contributions we make to advance this sector of our economy.  Speaking to the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police On Friday, I was honored to attend the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police annual meeting in McPherson. The annual meeting includes law enforcement leaders from across Kansas to discuss important public safety topics. Together, we are increasing partnerships between local, state and federal law enforcement officials to support our men and women in uniform and keep our communities safe. Thank you to the many men and women in uniform who attended the meeting and for all they do to serve our state. And, a special thanks to Garden City Police Chief Michael Utz for the kind introduction and invitation and to State Senator Rick Wilborn for attending.    Walking in Wichita to End Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease The Alzheimer&#8217;s Association is an incredible advocate for those living with Alzheimer&#8217;s, and a steadfast partner in our work to end Alzheimer&#8217;s. Thanks to hundreds of Wichitans for participating on Saturday in the 2019 Wichita Walk to End Alzheimer&#8217;s. It was great to be with this group that is committed to seeing a day where no one suffers from this tragic disease. A special thanks Susan Peters and Greg \"The Hitman\" Williams for emceeing the event and for all those who helped organize Saturday&#8217;s event.

Celebrating the Career of K-State&#8217;s John Pence On Friday, I joined folks from across Manhattan and Kansas State University to celebrate the career and work of John Pence as he begins his retirement. Since joining Kansas State&#8217;s Division of Housing and Dining in 1963, Pence has served the university and its students in a variety of capacities. At nearly every turn, Pence has had a positive impact on those he worked with and the students in which he mentored. One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan &#150; JP&#8217;s &#150; is named after Pence. This is a sign of the legacy he&#8217;ll leave and his innovative spirit that has bolstered the entire university. Thanks, John, for your friendship. Robba and I are wishing you and Karen all the best in this new chapter.    Hosting a Harvey County Listening Tour Stop On Friday, I held another stop on my Kansas Listening Tour in Hesston. Folks from across Harvey County joined me to discuss a number of issues including veterans&#8217; healthcare, the recently-implemented VA MISSION Act, my work to get USMCA across the finish line, climate change, rural broadband deployment, access to healthcare in our communities, immigration and gun violence. Thank you to the State Representative Stephen Owens and former American Legion State Commander Paul Sanford for attending.    Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications  My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works. I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans.  Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for the spring 2020 session are due October 25. Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence.

Even with all the faults in our health care system, few around the world would argue that America has the highest level of innovation available to patients. *We have more cutting-edge treatments available, more clinical trials conducted and more research and development than all other countries combined. * For example, Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a deadly and debilitating disease that slowly eliminates a child's ability to move and breathe. The U.S. has two cutting edge medicines to treat this deadly disease, one of which stops the spread of the disease in its tracks. *This treatment is only available here in America.* My colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the committee in Congress responsible for writing the majority of our nation's health care laws, have been working on bipartisan solutions to lower drug prices. *Our committee recently approved nine different solutions that would save you major money at the pharmacy counter, six of which have passed the House and await action by the Senate. *However, our work is nowhere near done. There are a number of other policies and packages being worked on that would make prescription drugs drastically more affordable and hold drug companies accountable when they try to game the system to raise prices at your expense. *Unfortunately, instead of taking note of our bipartisan commitment to solve the drug pricing crisis, Speaker Nancy Pelosi spent all year crafting a one-sided and wholly partisan plan that would raise your prescription costs. *Her proposal lays the groundwork for a one-size-fits-all government takeover of health care that would reduce access and increase costs on all patients. Time and again, Washington Democrats send the signal they want the government to have complete control over your health care - particularly what kinds of medicine you're allowed to access.* I've always said you deserve the right to choose what health care is best for you, and the only way to do that is by working together - Republicans and Democrats - to get it done.* Republicans have acted in previous years to reduce drug prices by fueling medical innovation and increasing competition. *In fact, last year the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved a record number of generic drugs - 971 in total, the most in history - driving competition and giving consumers more choices, notably including the first generic version of the EpiPen.* While I'm disappointed Washington Democrats are forcing Congress to waste valuable time on a hyper-partisan plan that has no hope of becoming law, I remain committed to finding bipartisan solutions to lower your drug prices. *Just last week I joined Congressman G. K. Butterfield - a Democrat from Wilson - to introduce a bill to support children with cancer and other rare diseases.* The *Creating Hope Act* incentivizes the development of treatments and cures for rare pediatric diseases and cancers by offering faster approval of medicines to any company that introduces a cure or treatment for a rare pediatric disease or cancer. *Ever since I became your Congressman, I have committed myself to working across the aisle. I will continue to try to work with any Democrat or Republican to deliver bipartisan solutions you and your family deserve. * *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* [image = [link 1] [image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] [image = [link 6] [image = [link 7] [image = [link 8] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":4.2758455},{"name":"Senator Rick Scott","address":"Newsletter@rickscott.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-09-20","subject":"Senator Rick Scott's Week in Review","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }            &nbsp;                         Sunday marked the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month.

See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.              Sen. Rick Scott: U.S. Must Increase Pressure on Iran  Senator Rick Scott issued the below statement urging U.S. action following the Saudi Arabian oil attack. &nbsp; Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Iran needs to know that acts of aggression against the United States or our allies will not be tolerated. Until the United States increases pressure on Iran, they will continue these attacks. We have to protect the safety and security of our military assets and our men and women in uniform that are in the region, as well as the security of our allies in the region, especially Israel. Military conflict is not our first choice, but we must take this seriously. President Trump must not make any concessions to Iran ahead of the UN General Assembly.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott to PM Netanyahu: U.S. Stands with Israel, Our Partner and Ally  Following his trip to Israel last month, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reiterate the United States&#8217; steadfast support for Israel, its security, and the safety of U.S. military assets in the Middle East. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott, Martha McSally, Mike Braun, and Joni Ernst Move to Make Child Tax Credit Permanent  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Martha McSally, Senator Mike Braun, and Senator Joni Ernst to introduce the Child Tax Credit Extension Act. This bill would make the expansion of the child tax credit, which was included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, permanent for families across the nation.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Over my eight years as Governor of Florida, we cut taxes nearly 100 times and returned more than $10 billion back to hardworking taxpayers. We completely turned our economy around and added nearly 1.7 million jobs for families across the state. I&#8217;m proud to build on our efforts by joining Senator McSally to sponsor the Child Tax Credit Extension Act, which will give families across the nation even more of their hard-earned money back and continue our economic growth.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator McSally's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: We Must Support Our Nation&#8217;s Holocaust Survivors  During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims, Senator Rick Scott spoke on the importance of honoring the memory of the millions of victims of the Holocaust, as well as supporting the survivors and their families. Watch video from the hearing HERE or below.      &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: CBO Should Stop Covering for Socialists, Give Us Score of Medicare for All&nbsp;  Following repeated requests from Republicans for the Congressional Budget Office to score either the House or the Senate versions of the Socialist Democrats&#8217; Medicare for All bill, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;On multiple occasions, Republicans have requested a score from the Congressional Budget Office of the Socialist Democrats&#8217; Medicare for All proposal, especially Budget Committee Ranking Member Bernie Sanders&#8217; bill filed in the Senate this year. So far, the CBO has refused. It is irresponsible and unconscionable that the CBO refuses to tell us the price tag for a healthcare proposal that has become the centerpiece of the Democrats&#8217; agenda, both in Congress and in their presidential campaigns.  &#8220;I sent yet another letter to the CBO asking for a score. The American people deserve to know how much this proposal would cost, how much taxes would be raised, and how many Americans would lose their employer-sponsored healthcare. This is why the CBO exists. They need to do their job.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more, including the full letter, HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: More Power to the States = Better ROI on Taxpayer Investment  On Wednesday, Senator Rick Scott released an episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money. See previous Washington Waste Wednesday features HERE, HERE and HERE.  This week's episode focuses on how the federal government can stop wasting taxpayer dollars by giving more power back to the states. One example is healthcare. Obamacare proved that a one size fits all approach doesn&#8217;t work. States should be able to figure out what works for them so they can provide better quality care while also reducing the cost to the taxpayers. Senator Scott did this in Florida, and is committed to making Washington work for families across the nation so taxpayers get the best return on the investment&nbsp;of their hard earned tax dollars.&nbsp; See more in the video HERE or below.   &nbsp;&#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Chris Murphy Lead Bipartisan American Security Drone Act to Prohibit U.S. Government from Purchasing Drones From Adversaries   Senators Rick Scott, Chris Murphy, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Richard Blumenthal and Marco Rubio introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats like Iran and China.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;There are nations around the world, like China, that are actively building up their militaries to compete with America. China is STEALING our technology and intellectual property, yet the U.S. Government continues to buy critical technology, like drones, with American tax dollars from Chinese companies backed by their government. For far too long, we have turned a blind eye to China and allowed their technology into some of the most critical operations of the U.S. Government. This has to stop. The American Security Drone Act protects our information and national security by prohibiting the federal government and our military from buying drones manufactured in countries that are our adversaries.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151; Sen. Rick Scott Joins Bipartisan Bill to Repeal Medical Device Tax  Senator Rick Scott announced his co-sponsorship of the Protect Medical Innovation Act, which permanently eliminates the medical device tax &#150; a 2.3 percent tax on the nation&#8217;s most innovative industries enacted under President Obama as part of the Affordable Care Act.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;During my time as Governor of Florida, we returned $10 billion back to Florida&#8217;s hardworking taxpayers. My focus on cutting taxes and reducing burdensome regulations helped Florida businesses thrive and create nearly $1.7 million jobs in just eight years. I&#8217;m proud to work with my colleagues to build on Florida&#8217;s success and create an environment where businesses, small and large, can succeed. Florida is home to a variety of medical device companies, employing nearly 21,000 Floridians with high-paying jobs. Eliminating the burdensome medical device tax fosters innovation and helps Florida&#8217;s manufacturers succeed and create more jobs for families.&#8221; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Introduce Bill to Permit Canadian Snowbirds to Visit the U.S. for Longer  Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio introduced the Canadian Snowbirds Act, legislation that would allow some Canadian citizens to spend up to eight months a year vacationing in the United States, two months longer than they are allowed to stay now. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;We worked incredibly hard to turn Florida&#8217;s economy around, and our tourism industry played a big role. Last year, Florida welcomed a record 126 million visitors, including 3.5 million visitors from Canada. When we welcome visitors to our state, our communities thrive, businesses grow, and job opportunities are created for Florida families. I&#8217;m proud to join Senator Rubio in sponsoring the Canadian Snowbirds Act to allow our Northern neighbors to enjoy two more months of Florida&#8217;s incredible weather and allow our tourism industry to continue to thrive.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more from Senator Rubio's office HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott to FCC Chairman: Put Our National Security First; Don&#8217;t Renew Pacific Light Cable Network License  Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai urging him to put American security first, and not renew the license for the Pacific Light Cable Network, which would ultimately threaten the freedom of Hong Kong and U.S. national security. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Recognizes Two Year Anniversary of Hurricane Maria  On the two year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;Hurricane Maria was an absolutely devastating storm, and your heart breaks for all the families impacted. I&#8217;m proud of everything we&#8217;ve done to help Puerto Rico rebuild over the last two years, but there is still work to be done. I vowed to be Puerto Rico&#8217;s voice in the Senate and that will never change. I am working closely with Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz&#225;lez-Col&#243;n and Puerto Rico&#8217;s leadership to make sure the Island is supported and has the resources it needs to continue rebuilding.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  El senador Rick Scott reconoce el segundo aniversario del hurac&#225;n Mar&#237;a  En el segundo aniversario del hurac&#225;n Mar&#237;a, el senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaraci&#243;n.

Rick Scott on Higher Ed: I&#8217;m Working to Bring Florida&#8217;s Success to America  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel on his five proposals to make education more affordable for every student in America. In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;m spending my time focused on what we can do to make college affordable for students and incentivize the higher-education system to prepare students for a job upon graduation.  I know we can successfully do this because we did it in Florida.&#133; &nbsp; These are simple concepts &#151; but politicians in Washington and around the country too often fail to understand that. They just want to give out government money tied to no results. But, that&#8217;s not fair to taxpayers, who get no return on their investment for funding colleges and universities that can&#8217;t prepare students for jobs.  The Democrats are proposing policy plans that would bankrupt and destroy our country, just to win a presidential primary. But we deserve better. Hopeful parents and grandparents deserve better. Hard-working students deserve better. We all deserve better, and now is the time for serious discussion about a path forward.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel HERE.&nbsp;  &#151;  Sen.

Rick Scott: U.S., European Partners Need to Hold Iran Accountable  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for Fox News on the need to hold Iran accountable for its aggression against the U.S. and our ally, Israel. &nbsp;In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, &#8220;While I visited Israel many times when I served as governor of Florida, my most recent trip gave me a clearer perspective on Israel&#8217;s proximity to its enemies: Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS and&nbsp;Iran.  I visited nearly all of Israel&#8217;s borders and one thing is clear:&nbsp;Israel&nbsp;is a country nearly surrounded by nations and terrorist groups that want it wiped off the face of the Earth. And Iran is leading that charge.&#133;  Iran needs to know that acts of aggression against the United States or Israel will not be tolerated. Until the United States increases pressure on the Iranians, they will continue these attacks.  We have to protect the safety and security of our military assets and our men and women in uniform in the region, as well as the security of our allies, especially Israel.&#8221;  Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE.   &#151;  Wall Street Journal:   Financial Times:   Homeland Preparedness News:   Sunshine State News:   Sunshine State News:   Florida Daily:   Florida Politics:   News Service of Florida:   Tampa Bay Times:   WJHG:   WSYR:   Florida Daily:   Florida Daily: Rick Scott Calls on Trump to Stand Firm Against Iran and Urges Support for Israel  Florida Daily:   El Nacional:   Noticia al Dia:               Sen.

Bill Johnson - September 19, 2019   Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email                           September 19, 2019   It's hard to believe summer&nbsp;is over, school is back in session, and the leaves are turning and will be falling soon. August -&nbsp;the month the&nbsp;national media&nbsp;claims&nbsp;Congress is on vacation - is also in the rearview mirror. I'd like them to follow me around in August and see if they'd still label it a vacation!  I held many constituent&nbsp;meetings, attended events, participated in tours, and hosted roundtables throughout&nbsp;all 18 counties I serve over the last few weeks. This year, I also added a one-day trip to another location: the U.S.-Mexico Border.&nbsp;Below, you'll find some of the highlights from&nbsp;of a few of these stops.     Stopping Bad Robocalls Act  Irritating robocalls are a serious problem. Last year alone, over 48 billion were made throughout the United States! Before we left Washington in July,&nbsp;the House passed H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, which also included legislation I introduced, H.R. 3434, the Tracing Back and Catching Unlawful Robocallers Act of 2019. I've heard from an overwhelming number of you about how frustrated you are with the issue of unwanted robocalls, and we acted. It's an issue both sides should be able to work together on - and we did. Now, the Senate needs to take up this important legislation and pass it.&nbsp;  I recorded the video below after the House&nbsp;approved this measure on a&nbsp;bipartisan basis.    Border Trip&nbsp;  In August, I traveled to&nbsp;the US border with Mexico&nbsp;at the El Paso crossing, which is the second busiest port of entry along our southern border. In this op-ed, I share some of what I saw there. In every aspect, the reality on the ground&nbsp;is much different than how the national media continues to portray it. Not much of a surprise, unfortunately.&nbsp;    I traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas on August 28.  One thing&nbsp;in particular that has bothered me since I left Texas&nbsp;is the fact that I cannot share the faces&nbsp;of our border agents and other immigration officials I met with due to the toxic political rhetoric infecting our culture. It's a shame. I spoke with&nbsp;some really great Americans - men and women who get up every day to do the difficult, and critical,&nbsp;job of protecting&nbsp;our country, and who have families and children in the local community. They're simply enforcing the law. But for serving our nation, their \"thank you\" from many on the far-left -&nbsp;and their partners in the national media - is fearing for their safety, and the safety of their families. It's easy to call names and hurl insults from a keyboard or behind a camera&nbsp;- but these are real people doing a great job under tremendously difficult&nbsp;circumstances and extreme pressure. And, they deserve our gratitude. Read a recap of my trip here.&nbsp;  Pass the USMCA!  The United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement - or USMCA for short -&nbsp;has enough votes to pass, but there isn&#8217;t a vote scheduled. It&#8217;s time for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the priorities of the American people above partisan politics and let us vote. It&#8217;s clear that House Democrats want to deny the president a victory. But, in reality, all they are doing is denying you - hardworking taxpayers - the right to a better, fairer trade deal. It&#8217;s a perfect example of why so many people are distrustful of career, Washington politicians. Ordinary, hardworking Americans aren&#8217;t interested in these political squabbles. They want results, and the USMCA would deliver. &nbsp;It&#8217;s expected to create 176,000 U.S. jobs and increase U.S. GDP by $68.2 billion within six years. That&#8217;s real money in&nbsp;your pockets. We finally have a president who says what he means and does what he says when it comes to protecting American workers. Previous presidents - of both political parties - have made big promises, but only paid lip service to the trade issue once in office. The American people have noticed. NAFTA went into effect in 1994 &#150;&nbsp;but, hasn&#8217;t been updated since. I don&#8217;t need to tell you that a lot has changed over the last 25 years, both here at home and around the globe. I also don&#8217;t need to tell you about the small towns everywhere that have been negatively impacted by NAFTA. It&#8217;s an outdated pact that needs to be put out to pasture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Farmers, manufacturing workers, union workers, and small businesses across Ohio and the United States broadly support the USMCA. They know this modernized trade agreement will lead to freer markets, fairer trade, continued economic growth, and more opportunities for Americans across the board. Donald Trump ran on putting the priorities of American workers first...he&#8217;s doing his job. Now it&#8217;s time that Congress does its job&nbsp;- or, more accurately, it&#8217;s time for Speaker Pelosi to allow us to do our job - by bringing the USMCA to the House Floor for a vote. Now that we're back in session, let's&nbsp;get it done!&nbsp;    I recorded the video above urging Nancy Pelosi to bring USMCA to a vote!  &nbsp;   Around Eastern and Southeastern Ohio  Southfield Energy in Wellsville  In early September, I toured the construction site of the future Southfield Energy natural gas electric generating facility. Construction started on this $1.3 billion project in May. When completed, it will produce 1,182 megawatts of electricity to local customers. Importantly, it's also generating nearly 1,000 construction jobs and is proving to be an economic boon to the local community and school district. Wellsville Local School hired additional teachers, reinstated elementary school art, boosted security across all buildings, will be able to completely renovate their sports stadium, and much more - and it's all directly due to this project. &nbsp;  This is just one more example of energy developers in our region&nbsp;being&nbsp;good community partners and having a&nbsp;positive impact on the lives of those of us who live in rural Ohio. And, keep your eyes open, there is much more of this kind of activity to come.&nbsp;    Visiting the&nbsp;future Southfield Energy site in Wellsville on September 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Update - Volunteer Hours &nbsp;  Volunteering at the Coolville Public Library in Athens County on August 15.  I traveled to Coolville to volunteer at the public library, where I sorted and packed bags as part of their \"Cargo Days,\" a program where the library borrows books and DVDs from other Ohio libraries that residents of Coollville can check out. I also recently volunteered in Belmont, Carroll, Gallia,&nbsp;Guernsey, Jefferson,&nbsp;Meigs,&nbsp;and Muskingum counties.  Beginning on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I pledged to volunteer for various causes and projects this year in each of the 18 counties that I represent, and I encouraged others to do the same. I have a few more stops to go to fulfill my pledge to hit all 18 counties this year. But, so far, I'm on track.&nbsp; Telehealth in Tuscarawas&nbsp;&nbsp; I also met&nbsp;with staff and employees, including CEO Bruce James, at Cleveland Clinic Union Hospital in Tuscarawas County in August. Union Hospital&#8217;s merger with Cleveland Clinic is well underway, and we discussed some of the challenges the hospital (and other rural hospitals) faces, paying specific attention to telehealth services. Union Hospital is using telehealth to effectively treat stroke patients, and I viewed some of the new technology they are using in this effort. As you know, I have been, and continue to be, a major proponent of expanded telehealth services to bring greater access to quality healthcare to rural America.

Big thanks to all the medical professionals and volunteers committed to the people of #TX22!      Dear Friend,  Last week marked the 18th anniversary of the brutal attacks on America on September 11, 2001 that took the lives of almost 3,ooo of our citizens. Since that day, we have lost many more first responders who climbed into the burning Twin Towers to rescue their fellow citizens. It's also been six years since we lost Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty who were killed in the tragic attack on our facilities in Benghazi. We will never forget any of them! Thank you for taking a moment to learn about what happened in the nation's capital and Texas&nbsp;last&nbsp;week.  Standing Up for American Energy American energy is not only powering our country and strengthening our economy. It is also helping our allies abroad reduce their reliance on energy from hostile regimes. Sadly, my Democrat colleagues want to obstruct American energy production. They brought up a trio of bills that would have a disastrous effect on the energy industry in TX-22 and our nation's economy as a whole. One of the bills, H.R. 205, actually goes so far as to outright ban energy development in parts of the Gulf of Mexico. I took to the floor of the House last week to voice my displeasure at the potential of this crippling legislation. You can watch my full remarks by clicking here.&nbsp;While these bills passed the House with my opposition, the Senate does not plan to bring them up for a vote.        Olson speaks on the House floor in opposition to anti-American energy legislation    Assisting Legal Immigrants The Houston region and our congressional district in particular is made up of folks from across the globe who join our community and are welcomed with open arms. Sadly, the naturalization process in TX-22 can take longer here than in other large cities. While folks in Los Angeles or New York City can get a green card in 12 - 13 months; the average processing time for Houston is 19 - 24 months. This is unacceptable. I've asked Congress for more resources to shorten processing times in Houston, and on Saturday I invited Houston immigration officials to address this issue at a forum where those seeking legal status in the U.S. could have their voices heard and their questions answered.       Olson addresses the green card information session with USCIS    Repeal of Burdensome Water Regulations During the Obama administration, unelected bureaucrats often issued overreaching rules and regulations. This top down, one-size-fits-all approach dismisses regional differences. One example is the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule that extended federal control over traditionally off-limits waters, like puddles, ponds and ditches. The rule hurt farmers and ranchers by allowing the government to make land and water-use decisions and farming practices. Thankfully, last Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Secretary Andrew Wheeler formally repealed this controversial rule. This is a big win for local control and Texas farmers.

We also honored the military men and women who answered the call to defend liberty and fight extremism following this horrific act of terror. We will never forget.

As co-chair of the Military Mental Health Task Force, I am committed to helping our veterans get the mental health treatment they need so we can combat this epidemic. We need to take care of those who take care of us. *Opposing House Democrats' Latest Attack on President Trump* [image = [link 3] House Democrats have sought to undo the 2016 election since the moment the American people chose Donald J. Trump to be their 45th president. Yesterday they again wasted the American people's time and money by bringing up a meaningless resolution in the hopes of appeasing their radical left base and distracting from an agenda that includes banning airplanes and kicking people off their health care. For months, Chairman Jerry Nadler and Judiciary Democrats have focused solely on harassing the president, rather than pursuing a legislative agenda to address the real problems facing Americans. Rather than fixing our broken immigration system, securing our border, and lowering prescription drug costs that cause pain for American families every day, they continue their impeachment charade. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will accept the will of the people, conclude their endless attacks on President Trump, and work with Republicans to help American families. To view a clip of my remarks, click here [link 4]. *Supporting American Energy Independence* This week, I voted against H.R. 205, H.R. 1941, and H.R. 1146, three bills that attempt to restrict energy development in our nation. Thanks to the Trump Administration's pro-energy policies, we are seeing the enormous economic, consumer, and security benefits generated by the energy industry, including many good-paying American jobs in western Pennsylvania. These misguided bills would not only halt this progress by eliminating jobs and increasing energy prices, but also move our nation towards dependence on foreign energy sources. H.R. 205 would permanently extend the moratorium on energy production in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico, H.R. 1941 would block oil and gas drilling in certain areas of the Atlantic and Pacific, and H.R. 1146 would repeal a portion of the 2017 *Tax Cuts and Jobs Act *that authorized oil and gas development in certain areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Pennsylvania families want to continue seeing lower energy bills and job creation in our communities, so I hope my colleagues across the aisle will instead work with us to promote ideas that encourage innovation and energy independence and keep energy costs low for all American families. *Voting Against Democrats' Latest Gun Grab, Protecting Second Amendment Rights* This week in the House Judiciary Committee, I voted against House Democrats' latest attempts to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights. Rather than working with Republicans on bipartisan proposals to address mass violence and keep Americans safe, Judiciary Democrats again chose to move several bills that infringe upon the Constitutional rights and liberties of law-abiding American citizens. One of these bills, the *Extreme Risk Protection Order Act* (H.R. 1236), strips Americans of their Second Amendment rights without notice and without recourse. We can't just ignore the Constitution when it doesn't fit the narrative. If we give up our First and Second Amendment rights, we have no way to defend the rest of our liberties. There is room to work together to keep our communities safe. Last year, when Republicans controlled the House, we passed, and President Trump signed into law, bipartisan legislation to prevent gun violence. The Fix NICS Act updated our nation's background check system, which to date has blocked more than 1.3 million gun sales to individuals prohibited from owning a firearm. Ranking Member Collins has introduced legislation, the *Mass Violence Prevention Act, *that would make it easier for law enforcement to coordinate and share information to prevent mass violence, reduce illegal street sales of firearms, and persecute perpetrators of gun violence. None of these are partisan proposals. Yet not a single Democrat has cosponsored this bill. Clearly, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are more focused on catering to the radical left than working with Republicans on legislation to address the real causes of gun violence. Republicans want to prevent mass violence. We want to keep Americans safe. But unlike my friends across the aisle, we know that taking guns out of the hands of good guys, only makes it easier for the criminals. [image = Official White House Photo by Joyce N. Boghosian I had a great time with President Donald Trump at the White House last weekend. Under President Trump's leadership, Pennsylvanians have already benefited from an economic resurgence following years of stagnation. Since November 2016, over 5.3 million jobs have been created, including 493,000 manufacturing jobs, largely due to the passage of the historic *Tax Cuts and Jobs Act* and the reduction of federal regulations burdening job creators. Last November, the U.S. unemployment rate finished at 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969, which included historically low unemployment rates for women, African Americans, and Hispanics. I will continue to support this administration's efforts to help American families and spur the private investments that grow our economy.

Dear Friend,  Today was a long time coming. We finally ditched one of the worst government regulations in my lifetime&#151;the Obama Administration&#8217;s disastrous &#8220;Waters of the U.S.&#8221; (WOTUS) rule.&nbsp;Back in 2015, then-President Obama and his band of unelected bureaucrats at the EPA, finalized the WOTUS rule&#151;trying to define farm ponds, streams, and ditches as &#8220;navigable waters&#8221; that could be used for interstate and international commerce. This outrageous government overreach would have given the EPA the authority to regulate more than 99 percent of Missouri farmland however they saw fit. Ultimately, it would have required landowners to seek permission from the EPA to do almost anything on their own land.&nbsp;Opposition to the Obama Administration rule was loud and fierce. Farmers, small business owners, landowners, local communities, and many others spoke out loudly against the rule&#151;in North Missouri and across the country. As a sixth-generation farmer, I strongly opposed the new rule from the start because I knew just how devastating it would be to rural America. &nbsp;  That&#8217;s why I worked diligently to delay, block, and fight the onerous WOTUS rule. Today, I&#8217;m proud to say common sense finally prevailed. Earlier, I joined members of the Trump administration along with business and agriculture leaders to announce that the Obama WOTUS rule is no more. Like many in rural America, I am thrilled the Trump Administration listened to the people and kept its promise to ditch the rule.        Rep Graves speaks about repeal of Obama-era WOTUS rule    This doesn&#8217;t mean folks are going to suddenly start polluting our streams, we&#8217;re simply going back to the common-sense regulations that existed before the Obama EPA&#8217;s unprecedented power grab. States, local communities, and hard-working Americans know better how to manage their land than a bunch of unelected bureaucrats in Washington.&nbsp;We can have clean water AND a healthy rural economy. We don&#8217;t need to sacrifice one for the other. Tonight, our farmers and landowners can sleep a bit more soundly knowing WOTUS has finally been laid to rest.

In her letter, Norton writes: &#8220;I am concerned about the low prosecution rates by your office compared to those of other cities.&nbsp; I would like an explanation for the very high declination rate for hate crime prosecutions by your office and whether these declination decisions stemmed from a lack of resources or from other causes.&#8221; Read the full letter HERE.

Norton Hosts Seniors Resource Fair Congresswoman Norton hosted a &#8220;Seniors Resource Fair&#8221; to give seniors valuable information on resources available to them.&nbsp; There are many services and organizations dedicated to helping seniors across the District, but residents often do not know all the services available to help them.&nbsp; Staff helped connect seniors with local resources they need to live healthy and secure lives, with workshops on Finances, Medicare Fraud, and Exploitation of Seniors.&nbsp; Seniors also engaged in memory games and appropriate physical fitness.  \"Our Seniors Resource Fair was geared to what seniors tell us most interests them,&#8221; Norton said.&nbsp; &#8220;The event was filled with valuable workshops and good fun.&#8221; If you or someone you know needs assistance as a senior, please call our District Office at 202-408-9041.

","body":"Dear Friends! It was a great pleasure to spend the month of August back home in the beautiful 2nd Congressional District of Colorado! It was a busy month for my staff and I. From hosting Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for a discussion about healthcare in Broomfield, to discussing higher education policy with the experts at our local universities, to visiting with our first responders and veterans, and so much more, it was a productive month that served as a tremendous reminder of the incredible work underway in Colorado and of the goals the people of the 2nd Congressional District want prioritized in the U.S. House. VISITING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ON A FACT FINDING MISSION Last week, I visited El Paso on a fact finding mission to get answers and conduct necessary oversight on the awful conditions we have witnessed along our southern border. I visited the Clint U.S. Customs and Border Patrol facility, as well as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in El Paso. I also joined the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship for a field hearing in El Paso focusing on conditions along the southern border and anti-immigrant rhetoric and violence aimed at immigrant communities. We are a nation, not only that welcomes immigrants, but that is born of immigrants. As Americans, we will not sit by as a the bedrock legacy of immigration that has built our country is trampled on. In El Paso, I also had the opportunity to join my friend and colleague Congresswoman Veronica Escobar for a visit of the El Paso memorial, honoring the 22 victims who were killed in the deadly mass shooting in a Walmart in El Paso just last month. I was moved beyond words to make that visit. Our country has an epidemic of gun violence that must be addressed urgently. We must also address the hate that's fueling this kind of violence, like that that was exhibited in the Walmart shooting. HOSTING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR A DISCUSSION ON HEALTHCARE This August I had the great pleasure of hosting Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in Broomfield, Colorado for a discussion on healthcare policy. Joined by Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway, we discussed a wide variety of topics including protecting and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, making prescription drugs more affordable for Americans, and supporting the national Federally Qualified Health Centers and the School-Based Health Centers programs. We were also able to discuss new legislation I introduced this month that will specifically help Coloradans access more affordable healthcare. I introduced the Air Ambulance Affordability Act to eliminate surprise billing in our air ambulance services, legislation that ensures that our rural and mountain communities can obtain the emergency care they need without being buried in bills for medical care they may not have agreed to or received unknowingly. I look forward to continuing to fight for affordable, accessible health care for all Coloradans. DISCUSSING HIGHER EDUCATION WITH THE EXPERTS I was honored to have the opportunity to sit down with students, professors and faculty from Front Range Community College and Colorado State University to discuss a variety of topics relating to accessibility of higher education! I'm incredibly inspired by the work of President Andrew Dorsey and the faculty at Front Range Community College. Given the tremendous debt that far too many students take on to pursue higher education, each and every step our government and institutions of higher education take to increase affordability makes the realization of education and the American Dream that much more accessible. At the Federal level, I'm proud to be championing bills to expand the use of open resource text books and to simplify transfer processes. It is to the benefit not just of the individual, but our whole society when every American, regardless of income level or zip code, can access quality higher education and I'm pleased to represent so many higher ed institutions that are working hard every day to help each student access the academic path that fits with their needs. BBQING WITH OUR FIRST RESPONDERS & AN OPEN HOUSE WITH THE VETERANS IN OUR DISTRICT My team and I were thrilled to host an open house with resources for our district's veterans. It was a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the resources available to Colorado's veterans and to have the opportunity to connect with many of those veterans in person. A big thank you to our local VA services staff for coming out to this veterans open house and answering questions on benefits and services in the area! We were also excited to host a barbecue at Station 3 in Fort Collins for our firefighters, first responders and city officials. I always appreciate the opportunity to connect with these community heroes and express gratitude for their work on behalf of the entire 2nd Congressional District of Colorado. EXPLORING OUR PUBLIC LANDS WITH THE SIERRA CLUB INDIAN PEAKS CHAPTER Congressman Neguse hikes in Chautauqua Park I always enjoy the opportunity to explore Colorado's beautiful public lands and it was an extra treat to do so with the Indian Peaks Chapter of Sierra Club. While hiking in Chautauqua we discussed the need to preserve our cherished public spaces and the urgent actions necessary to combat the existential crisis of climate change. These conversations have re-energized me to ensure we are taking substantial steps in the U.S. House to ensure that Colorado's public lands are preserved for all future generations and that we are focusing our greatest efforts on solving the climate crisis. I am proud to have several bills addressing these needs and look forward to moving those forward as Congress continues its legislative work. BACK TO WORK IN D.C. It was incredible to be back in district for the month of August, connecting with constituents from across our district. Now it's time to get back to work for the people and I am returning to Congress with renewed energy and a plethora of great ideas from the constituents I am so honored to represent! Given the multiple appalling mass shootings that have occurred this summer, I am proud that one of the first actions we will take upon our return is a markup on gun safety measures in the Judiciary Committee, including a ban on high-capacity magazines, strengthening Extreme Risk Protection Orders, and enhancing background checks. I will be paying close attention to the bills we are hearing in the Judiciary Committee and am grateful for the opportunity to take meaningful action to address gun violence in our nation. I look forward to getting back to work for you this Congress on a wide variety of issues!
