[{"name":"Congressman Bill Flores","address":"Bill.Flores@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-02-14","subject":"Congressman Bill Flores Discusses the Latest from Washington","body":"February 14, 2020 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : Bill Flores Discusses the Latest from Washington WASHINGTON, D.C. - Bill Flores Discusses the Latest from Washington U.S. Representative Bill Flores (R-Texas) issued the following statements regarding House passage of H.J.Res. 79, Removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment aka the Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act; the release of President Trumps FY 2021 budget proposal; and honoring a constituent from the 17th District. Democrats Unconstitutional Attempt to Expand Abortion On Thursday, I voted against H.J.Res.79, the radical lefts attempt to force their anti-life agenda on the American people. This resolution permanently extends the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution. The original deadline for ratification expired in 1982, and only 35 of the 38 states required approved the Amendment. Make no mistake, this resolution is not about equal rights under the law. Democrats and their abortion industry allies made it abundantly clear that they supported this resolution because it would allow unfettered access to abortions on demand and force hardworking taxpayers to foot the bill. As your Representative, I believe that life is sacred, and I will remain committed to preserving the sanctity of life and protecting the lives of the unborn. Additionally, the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment passed 38 years ago. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that Congress lacks the legal authority to extend the deadline, and even liberal Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said that Congress must start over if it wants an ERA. This is just another partisan messaging bill by House Democrats to appease their liberal base instead of legislation to address real problems for Texas families. It is time for the House to work to find bipartisan solutions to issues that Americans really want -- border security, immigration, prescription drug prices, health care reform, pandemic defenses, and infrastructure. President Trumps FY 2021 Budget Proposal I applaud President Trump for setting a budget blueprint that prioritizes Americas safety and security while reducing wasteful spending to balance the budget and reduce the deficit. His budget builds on policies that have created historic economic growth and boosted the opportunity, security, and well-being of all Americans. The President has proposed a budget every year since taking office. His budget will continue the Great American Comeback that he put forth in his State of the Union Address. These policies will continue the prosperity and growth that we have seen under President Trumps leadership. Again, for the second year in a row, House Democrats have failed to propose any budget resolution. This is an abject failure to perform one of Congress most basic functions. Budgets reflect values and Democrats have an obligation to show the American people their priorities and how they will pay for them. They have proposed trillions of dollars in new spending on socialist schemes like the Green New Deal, but continue to hide the true cost of these crazy ideas by not proposing a budget. While I support most elements of the Presidents budget, there are three areas which need to be addressed by Congress  first, high deficit levels should be reduced (without raising taxes); second, the long-term economic impacts of proposed cuts to basic research need to be reassessed; and third, the national security risks associated with proposed cuts to diplomacy and other soft power expenditures should be reviewed closely. In the weeks to come, I will work with the White House and my Congressional colleagues to address these issues.

This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year. This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model. It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference. In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area. I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our country&#8217;s food and agriculture interests. Read more here,&nbsp;  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products. The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.&nbsp;I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient. This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.&nbsp;For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products. Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store. Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as &#8220;milk&#8221;. I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law.

This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game. NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!  Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce.&nbsp;   It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing. In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease. I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases. I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.   I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards. I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress. Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events. The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees. This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires. Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance. This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base.

Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving on&#8239;our embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts. This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted. As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical. Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders. Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots. We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and I&#8217;m honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress. Read more here.  Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown. The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities.&nbsp; Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns. Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities. I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.

The op-ed was published in&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;this week. Read it here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!

Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for \"absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies\" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases. Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines &#8211; though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks.  \"New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,\" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon. \"They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Homeland Security for Children Act (), the DHS Acquisition Reform Act of 2019 (), the providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2546) to designate certain lands in the State of Colorado as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes; providing for consideration of the joint resolution () removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment; and for other purposes. (), the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act (), the Protecting America&#8217;s Wilderness Act (), and the removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment (). Budget season has officially begun. Earlier this week, I received the President&#8217;s budget request for Fiscal Year 2021. While Congress holds the Article I powers of the Constitution, or the &#8220;power of the purse,&#8221; the President&#8217;s budget outlines his vision for the nation.&nbsp;The release of the President&#8217;s budget request historically kicks off the congressional budget process in both the House and the Senate. It serves as a starting point for lawmakers to make spending decisions and analyze the economic outlook for the coming year. The framework of the budget process can be divided up into :   President submits the budget to Congress House and Senate mark up and pass budget House and Senate conference the budget resolution Consideration and passage of Appropriations bills Consideration of reconciliation/authorization Start of new Fiscal Year (October 1st)   I applaud President Trump for putting forward a budget proposal. That&#8217;s more than we can say for the People&#8217;s House, where, for the second straight year, the Democrat majority has failed to produce a budget. That&#8217;s not leadership.  This is interesting to me because, on the House Budget Committee majority&#8217;s website, there is a section titled &#8220;Responsibility.&#8221; The first sentence in this section reads, &#8220;The Committee&#8217;s chief responsibility is to draft an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that provides a congressional framework for spending and revenue levels, the federal surplus or deficit, and public debt.&#8221;  In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done. Yet, here in the House, in the greatest country in the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget. Simply put, a failure to budget is a failure to govern.  We must start doing our job to put our country on a sustainable, responsible fiscal path. This is our duty to the American people, not promoting budget-busting policies, including Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, that will leave future generations saddled with the consequences of House Democrats&#8217; eagerness to spend with no way to pay. It&#8217;s time for Democrats to stop punting one of our most basic responsibilities in Congress. I&#8217;m ready for them to join us at the table to do the difficult work.  While we can&#8217;t analyze the Democrats&#8217; budget &#8211; because they won&#8217;t put one forth &#8211; the House Budget Committee did hold a hearing on the President&#8217;s FY 2021 budget proposal with&nbsp;OMB&nbsp;Acting Director Russell Vought. As we discussed, the proposal seeks to balance our fiscal constraints with the need to fund the priorities of the country, including national defense. The President&#8217;s budget includes deficit reduction measures, specifically $4.6 trillion between 2021-2030. This is a strong start, but more work remains to be done to put our country on a solid fiscal path. Moving forward, it is imperative that we work together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to advance a budget that funds our nation&#8217;s important priorities while acknowledging our very real fiscal challenges. You can read my full opening remarks .  MEETINGS  In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! It was a pleasure to meet with Keturah Finch and Tanner Arnwine of Bentonville to talk about neurofibromatosis&nbsp;(NF), a genetic, tumor-generating disorder. We discussed research through the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) and the National Institutes of Health, as well as its value to civilians, warfighters, and veterans suffering from&nbsp;NF. Novel research has led to a new era of medical breakthroughs for a variety of illnesses, but there is still much more work to be done across many fields. We must continue to make smart investments that build our pipeline of science, research, and medical discovery. The next morning, I invited my Republican House Budget Committee colleagues to join me at the Office of Budget and Management to hear more about the President&#8217;s recently released budget proposal, as well as fiscal priorities of the White House. As I mentioned earlier, I appreciate the Administration for drafting a budget. Congress should be doing the same thing, but House Democrats have refused to put forth a proposal yet again. In the real world, everyday Americans and Arkansans are held accountable for their income, expenses, and savings. Main Street job creators and business leaders are held accountable for demonstrating fiscal restraint, for making tough choices, and for setting priorities. Congress should not be any different. But in the House, Democrats are refusing to put forth the very document that tells us what we need to know about how much we&#8217;re spending, what we&#8217;re raising in revenue, and the impact of our deficits and debt on our economy and the nation. The American people deserve better.  Representatives from NorthWest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) were in Washington, and I had the opportunity to hear some important school and curriculum updates. We talked about enhancing Career and Technical Education (CTE), the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act &#8211; which I voted for &#8211; and the National Science Foundation&#8217;s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. NWACC just received an ATE grant for a project that will create a Technical Certificate in Integrated Design to help expand the skilled technical workforce, especially in construction fields and engineering design. NWACC is helping prepare our students for the jobs of today and the future, and I appreciate their dedication to providing quality education and opportunities in the Third District. I thank Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson, Dr. Ricky Tompkins, Jim Hall, Rachel Harris, and DeAnne Witherspoon for their time and work!  I then met with the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police. I always appreciate meeting with our law enforcement officers and hearing more about their work to protect and serve our communities. We discussed many issues, including The Protect and Serve Act (HR 1325). I&#8217;m a cosponsor of this legislation, which creates new federal penalties for individuals who deliberately attack or attempt to cause significant bodily injury to any law enforcement officer. This bill aims to deter attacks against police officers who have increasingly been targeted and face higher levels of hostility because of the uniform they wear. I&#8217;m extremely thankful for the work of the men and women who wear the badge each day!  My next meeting was with the Enlisted Association of the Arkansas National Guard. It was wonderful to sit down with Arkansas National Guard members from Fort Smith and other parts of the state to talk about their work, duties, and programs that support their efforts. We also had a productive discussion on the National Guard&#8217;s role going forward in the Space and Cyber domains. The Arkansas Air National Guard has both Space and Cyber missions. As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas Army&nbsp;National Guard, I salute their service and thank them for their commitment to the Natural State and our nation! I then welcomed Dr. John Lorsch, Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, to my office to speak about the Institutional Development Award (IDea) program and its impact on Arkansas. Our conversations focused on the NIH&#8217;s research and biomedical investments within the Natural State.  I wrapped up the day at the National Guard Association, where I joined National Guard members from across the country to talk about defense efforts, legislative advocacy, and my work on the House Budget Committee. I shared stories about my time in uniform, as well as my perspectives on appropriations work in Congress. I talked about the constrained resource environment we face, and how growing mandatory spending is squeezing the portion of discretionary funding available for national priorities. The Guard brings great value to the fight, and it was my honor to talk to this great group and answer questions.  The next morning, I met with Dan Hendrix, President and CEO of the World Trade Center Arkansas. I appreciated an update on their work, economic development in the community, small business grants, and the impact of recent trade deals on the state. Arkansas is a state of opportunity, and the World Trade Center Arkansas is a pivotal resource that has supported bilateral trade services, global connections, and export development programs for local businesses.  Our region is full of opportunity, and it was great to speak with students from the Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program. FLEX students spend an academic year in the U.S. living with a volunteer host family and attending high school. The students, who are from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are currently living and going to school in Russellville and Springdale! They said that they have learned a lot during their time living and studying in the region &#8211; and that they love the sense of community in Arkansas! &nbsp;  Modernized infrastructure is vital to keeping our communities economically competitive and strong. It was great to wrap up my week in Washington with Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.&nbsp;We had very productive conversations on rural infrastructure grants, local projects like I-49 and regional airport improvements, and budget and appropriations.&nbsp;We also highlighted the importance of addressing U.S. infrastructure needs using smart and effective methods that provide results and maximize our resources. Today, I also want to wish everyone &#8211; especially my wonderful wife, Terri &#8211; a Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day! I'm grateful that my office was able to present some special valentines to residents at Methodist Village Senior Living in Fort Smith. Spreading some cheer and happiness is what this day is all about! I&#8217;m looking forward to being back in the district and traveling the Natural State next week. Wishing everyone a Happy Presidents&#8217;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;on Monday! Let us reflect and honor the leaders who've held our nation's highest office to serve the American people. By swearing an oath to &#8220;preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,&#8221; they each answered the call to lead our great country throughout history.

The Clean Economy Act heeds the call for bold climate action, and at the same time boosts American competitiveness, promotes healthier frontline communities and fosters a growing economy that works for everyone. The Clean Economy Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use existing authorities to put our country on a pathway to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050.   &#8220;Let there be no doubt, climate change is a real, immediate and growing threat to national security, public health and our economy. The longer we fail to act, the more costly climate change will be,&#8221; said Senator Baldwin. &#8220;The Clean Economy Act will help confront the climate crisis by aiming to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. I&#8217;m proud to support this effort because taking bold action on climate change is not just an environmental goal for Wisconsin, it is an urgent economic necessity.&#8221;   The world&#8217;s leading scientists have warned that humanity must limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. According to the United Nations annual Emissions Gap Report released last month, collective global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not yet substantial enough to reach that temperature goal. By providing clear direction from Congress, the Clean Economy Act mandates EPA and other federal agencies to use authorities and tools already available to them to rapidly achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while fostering a stronger, fairer economy for all Americans. Any plan developed by the EPA must achieve rapid reductions at minimal costs, prioritize public health, and support a strong labor workforce. EPA is also required to build upon existing state, local and private climate programs and set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2025, 2030 and 2040. Other federal agencies would be required to do their part to help the nation meet the net-zero goal and help enhance America&#8217;s global competitiveness through investments in research and development, innovation and equitable access to worker training. This net-zero legislation is supported collectively by major environmental groups, business groups and organized labor.

There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a blue-collar boom in this country. Thanks to Republican-led pro-growth policies, the American economy is stronger than ever.&nbsp; We have built an inclusive economy where the least well-off are making some of the fastest gains, and unemployment is at an all-time low.  Thanks to the promise of the United States- Mexico- Canada Trade Agreement and the Phase One China trade deal, the American worker is stronger than ever. With a national unemployment rate of 3.5% and a Virginia unemployment rate of 2.6%, our farmers, manufacturers, and producers are positioned to profit.  Just this month, President Trump signed the USMCA, which will create upwards of 176,000 new American jobs, including 48,000 manufacturing positions, which have the potential to&nbsp;revitalize Southside Virginia.&nbsp;  In his address President Trump addressed the great work he has done; I am proud to be partnering with him on Republican-led pro-growth policies. In the past year I have been working hard for the people of our district. To revitalize the economy in Southside, we need a series of consecutive miracles; working together these programs can bring back jobs and educational opportunities to the rural parts of our district.  America is strong once again.&nbsp; We will continue to grow the middle class and raise wages. In the 5th District we will continue to bring consecutive miracles to Southside Virginia.  I am excited about the recent jobs numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed that in January the U.S. added 225,000 new jobs.&nbsp; Wages are up 3.1% over the past year and are growing fastest for America's working and middle class. I am proud of the work we have done and know that under President Trump's leadership this success can continue.&nbsp; If you need help with a federal agency, please contact my Charlottesville Office at (434) 973-9631 or&nbsp;see my staff during our mobile office hours on Tuesday's across the 5th District.&nbsp; If you would like to schedule a tour of either the Capitol, or another federal building in Washington, including the White House or the FBI, please contact our&nbsp;Washington D.C. office at (202) 225-4711.&nbsp;  Sincerely,   Denver Riggleman Member of Congress  Mobile&nbsp;Office&nbsp;Hours  Mobile&nbsp;office&nbsp;hours will be held&nbsp;on Tuesday, February 11, 2020.&nbsp; Constituents are invited to meet with a representative of the&nbsp;office&nbsp;in&nbsp;Appomattox&nbsp;County, Bedford&nbsp;County, Campbell&nbsp;County, Cumberland&nbsp;County, and&nbsp;Nelson&nbsp;County.&nbsp;  These&nbsp;office&nbsp;hours&nbsp;offer constituents the opportunity to meet with the&nbsp;Congressman&#8217;s staff in their communities and receive assistance with issues involving federal agencies.&nbsp; Staff will be available to assist and answer questions regarding Social Security benefits, Medicare, immigration, veterans benefits, and more.&nbsp; All are encouraged to attend.

The President&#8217;s emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, and I&#8217;ve been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.   I am especially proud that President Trump announced his public support for my bicameral, bipartisan voluntary paid leave bill for hardworking families that does not increase taxes or create a new government program.This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy. This effort is yet another example of the critical, bipartisan work in Congress that I am proud to lead with the support of my colleagues.&nbsp; During his remarks, President Trump also surprised the family of Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams with his unexpected return from deployment in Afghanistan. Sergeant Williams is originally a native of Peru, New York. He is also a past Peru Fire Department Firefighter. I am proud that Sergeant Williams hails from the North Country, and it was incredible to witness him and his family reunite as they were honored for the sacrifices they have made in the name of our freedom. I thank Sergeant Williams for his service, and I am proud that President Trump reaffirmed his support for our military families. I was also proud to have David Fisher, dairy farmer from St. Lawrence County, accompany me to the State of the Union as my guest. David and the Fisher family have been operating Mapleview Dairy for four generations in Madrid, New York. David has been an active member of his community, serving on the Madrid Town Board for many years, and is currently also in his second term as President of the New York Farm Bureau. He has been an outspoken advocate for farmers in the North Country. He is well versed on agriculture issues and always makes sure that Upstate New York agriculture has a seat at the table, particularly on results like the USMCA. It was great to have him in the audience.

Throughout this unfair and unprecedented process, I proudly stood up for the Constitution, the facts of the case, and my constituents in New York&#8217;s 21st district. I applaud the Senate&#8217;s diligence in their trial and just acquittal of the President. I'm looking forward to getting back to work for the American people.&nbsp; Meeting with Constituents and Organizations Important to the North Country        It was great to meet with a variety of constituent groups and organizations important to my work on behalf of the North Country this week. I discussed the importance of rural broadband, funding for students with disabilities, and school safety with the New York State School Board Association. I met with the North Country Workforce Development Board leadership about increasing access to affordable child care, workforce development priorities, and helping dislocated workers and rehabilitated former non-violent offenders successfully reenter the workforce. I also met with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to discuss prison reform and funding for the drug free communities program. We also discussed the vaping epidemic facing our youth and the need for funding to go towards addiction prevention and education. It is always great to meet with constituents from the district and discuss the issues most important to them. Hearing directly from my constituents guides my work and priorities in Congress. Opposing New York State Law Causing Suspension of Global Entry, Trusted Traveler Programs for New York Residents  This week, in response to New York State&#8217;s &#8220;Green Light Law&#8221;, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced their decision to suspend enrollment in Global Entry and other trusted-traveler programs for New York State residents. The &#8220;Green Light Law&#8221;, which took effect in December 2019, allows issuance of a driver&#8217;s license to illegal immigrants. In making their decision, DHS cited that the state&#8217;s sanctuary policies that safeguard immigrants from deportation. DHS will immediately stop accepting new applications from New York State residents to enroll or re-enroll in some of the agency&#8217;s travel programs, including Global Entry. New York is the only state to be impacted by DHS&#8217;s decision thus far. After repeatedly ignoring law enforcement experts at the federal and local level, Governor Cuomo&#8217;s prioritization of illegal immigrants over law abiding New Yorkers is continuing to have damaging effects. The Governor&#8217;s reckless Green Light Law not only has hampered efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, it is continuing to have harmful implications for our state. In December of last year, I warned Governor Cuomo that this irresponsible policy would inhibit our CBP officers at the Northern Border from doing their jobs. Qualified, legal citizens should not be penalized by the Governor&#8217;s unconscionable actions, which not only hinder our border patrol, law enforcement, and other agencies from being able to effectively do their job, but now also prevent our residents from receiving access to important travel programs.

This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and helps meet the needs of communities by increasing funding and reauthorizes the program through the next five years. Over the past decade, the GLRI has assisted Great Lakes communities after decades of environmental damage threatened public health, regional economies, and drinking water. The GLRI has enabled the 8-state region along the Great Lakes to undertake one of the world&#8217;s largest freshwater ecosystem restoration projects. Assisting our communities in cleaning up their drinking water systems, restoring fish and wildlife habitats, and combating invasive species are critical examples of how this GLRI funding benefits North Country communities. This funding plays an essential role in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes and the ecosystems that surround them, and I am proud to continue to advocate in full support of its projects.

I am proud to be leading the effort in coordinating support between local and state elected officials, community groups, and local businesses in the area surrounding Fort Drum to advocate for the installation&#8217;s selection as the final site. I sent a letter to the Army advocating for Fort Drum's designation, and led many petitions, signed by hundreds of constituents with more signing on each day, in support of the stationing and activation of the additional headquarters at Fort Drum. My offices have worked closely with Advocate Drum to coordinate an outpouring of support from the North Country. Fort Drum is the best option for the activation and stationing of the Army&#8217;s fourth corps headquarters, and I am proud to be passionately advocating for this alongside my constituents. As the number one advocate for Fort Drum, I have worked tirelessly to lead the coordination efforts across the North Country, to build support for the Army&#8217;s consideration. I will continue to raise awareness that Fort Drum has unmatched capabilities and ready to rapidly expand to meet the criteria to support an Army corps headquarters. Read more here.  As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!    Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress&nbsp;&nbsp;           Social Media Corner:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; ___________________  Featured Read:  Watertown Daily Times -&nbsp;President references Stefanik legislation in SOTU address  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said President Donald Trump delivered an &#8220;incredibly strong&#8221; State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he highlighted the Congresswoman&#8217;s legislation on paid leave and child tax credit.&#8220;The President&#8217;s emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country,&#8221; Ms. Stefanik said after the address, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.&#8221;&nbsp;During the address, Mr. Trump said he was proud to sign a law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave. And he called on Congress to pass the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, which he said would extend family leave to mothers and fathers across the nation.  &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful President Trump highlighted my bipartisan, bicameral legislation during his State of the Union address,&#8221; Ms. Stefanik said. &#8220;This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy.&#8221;&nbsp;Ms. Stefanik said the act would allow families the option to advance up to $5,000 of their recently-doubled child tax credit in the first year of a child&#8217;s life or the first year a family adopts a child. Most other paid leave proposals require parents to take off work to receive benefits, a release from Ms. Stefanik said. This bill allows teleworkers the option to access child care benefits and to continue working from home while they take care of their new child.   The bill does not raise taxes or take away from Social Security. It is the product of more than a year of work to craft a bill that could pass with bipartisan support, the release said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  _________________ Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:  Federal agencies.

The MPP allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to return applicants for admission to the United States to Mexico, pending their asylum application hearings. I&#8217;ve visited refugee camps around the world, and the conditions that the U.S. government is forcing these asylum-seekers to suffer are a disgrace to our nation and our shared values.&nbsp;   Congressman DeFazio standing in front of a makeshift shelter in the city of Matamoros, Mexico, which contains the largest refugee camp along the U.S.-Mexico Border of an estimated 2,000 people.  In Matamoros, I witnessed roughly 3,000 individuals living in squalor. Half are children. It is so dangerous, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisory&#8212;the same as Iran and Syria&#8212;for the area. The Mexican cartel operates openly and freely, and kidnapping, violence, and sexual assault are rampant. I met one woman who had fled El Salvador with her three daughters. Every night she sleeps outside her tent, on the zipper, to protect her daughters from being kidnapped and forced into sex trafficking. Despite widespread disease, including numerous cases of chronic infections, medical care is woefully inadequate. Basic infrastructure is also almost non-existent: open latrines filled with raw sewage exist immediately next to the Rio Grande, the contaminated river where families wash their laundry.&nbsp;  On the day of their hearing, individuals must arrive at the border checkpoint by 4:30 AM. Most petitioners are unable to see their court paperwork until that day. Approximately one percent of asylum-seekers have a lawyer, and if they are lucky enough to have representation, they usually meet their lawyer for the first time on the day of their hearing. They are given, at most, an hour to discuss their case and the hearing.&nbsp;  An estimated 60,000 asylum seekers have been forced back into Mexico under the MPP. Of those 60,000, roughly 120 have been granted asylum or some other relief.  We need to end the Remain in Mexico policy now. That&#8217;s why I am one of roughly 50 members of Congress cosponsoring H.R. 2662, the Asylum Seeker Protection Act, which would terminate the deplorable MPP program.&nbsp;  I hope more members of Congress go to Matamoros to bear witness to these conditions for themselves. Perhaps then Congress will finally have the courage to act.  Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr, &nbsp;His Legacy, and the Fight for Equality On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I was honored to address members of the Eugene community about Dr. King&#8217;s legacy of equality and the incredible contributions of women across the nation and in our community to promote equity. Since taking office, the president and the GOP have implemented policies that threaten the rights &nbsp;of women and people of color.&nbsp;  I am frustrated that many hard-won civil rights battles are at risk in today&#8217;s political climate. As my friend and colleague, civil rights hero Congressman John Lewis noted, &#8220;Of all the gifts given us by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I think the greatest has been the belief in society&#8217;s ability to change and the power each of us has to affect that change.&nbsp; We must not give up our fight.&#8221;   &#8220;There is no expiration date on equality,&#8221; Watch my full remarks to the Eugene MLK Jr. Day March here.  In January, Virginia became the pivotal 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), finally guaranteeing equal protections regardless of sex in our nation&#8217;s Constitution. With Virginia&#8217;s action, the ERA could finally be added to our Constitution &#8211; but the Trump administration&#8217;s Department of Justice is determined to stop this from happening and has issued a legal opinion arguing that the ratification deadline has passed. Well to them I say this &#8211; there is no expiration date on equality.  I am a proud cosponsor of H.J.Res. 38, legislation which would lift the arbitrary ERA ratification deadline. Majority Leader Hoyer has already announced his intention to bring this important legislation to the floor next month, and I look forward to giving it my full &nbsp;support.&nbsp;  I have also cosponsored and voted for legislation to fight for equality, such as tackling the wage discrimination that women and minorities face (H.R. 7 &#8211; Paycheck Fairness Act), protecting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault (H.R. 1585 &#8211; Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act), and protecting a women&#8217;s right to choose (H.R. 2975, Women&#8217;s Health Protection Act, H.R. 1692 &#8211; EACH Woman Act).&nbsp;  Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a priority to fight for equality. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment which guaranteed women&#8217;s constitutional right to vote, you can be sure I will continue to do everything in my power to defend a woman&#8217;s right to choose, protect access to critical healthcare, and strive to ensure the ERA&#8217;s addition to our Constitution. Discussing Science and Policy with OSU Students Last week, I spoke with Oregon State University students at a Science and Policy class taught by Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a world-renowned environmental scientist who served as the U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and served as an inaugural member of President Barack Obama&#8217;s Science Team from 2009-2013. We discussed the importance of integrating fact-based science and policy to inform policymakers on the existential crisis of climate change.  On the &nbsp;same day, a new report from NOAA revealed the devastating effects climate change is already inflicting on Dungeness crabs fisheries in the Pacific Northwest. The study found that ocean acidification along the Pacific Northwest is impacting the shells and sensory organs of Dungeness crabs, which could cause developmental delays and interfere with maturation. The Dungeness crab fishery is a multi-million-dollar industry in Oregon, and the report is one more disturbing example of just how urgent and overdue legislative action is. That&#8217;s why I am a cosponsor of the COAST Research Act, which would address the effects of ocean acidification on our marine ecosystems. This legislation, which passed the House with my full support last year, would reauthorize the Ocean Acidification Program of NOAA and expand research efforts to monitor the effects of coastal acidification. While I am proud that the House was able to pass this legislation, there is much more work that needs to be done to protect our oceans and address climate change.&nbsp;  The ability to protect the environment and address climate change is dependent on the foundation of science that is independently verifiable and free from political interference or bias, ideology, and conflicts of interests. I have and will continue to promote policies that are based in science, protect our environment, and reduce carbon pollution. Juliana v. United States Case Dismissed, But Not Defeated&nbsp; I&#8217;m angered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals&#8217; dismissal of the landmark&nbsp;Juliana v. United States, a&nbsp;constitutional climate lawsuit led by 21 youth plaintiffs, including seven from Oregon&#8217;s 4th Congressional District. In the face of a president and Republican-led Senate who blatantly ignore and discount the existential threat posed by climate change, the youth plaintiffs are working to bring our nation one step closer to achieving a legal foundation and requirement to solve this crisis. Last year, I was proud to back the youth plaintiffs by filing an amicus curiae brief with the Ninth Circuit Court. The plaintiffs of this lawsuit understand that the existential threat of climate change denies them the kind of future we should all be guaranteed under the Constitution. While the plaintiffs have requested the full Ninth Circuit to review the decision, Congress&nbsp;must&nbsp;take urgent action on climate change. As Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am working on a 21st Century transportation bill that will take dramatic steps to reduce carbon pollution and make significant investments in green technologies. I will continue to push Congress towards bold, transformative action that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, curtail greenhouse gas emissions, and protect our planet for future generations.

Trump, effectively condoning the President&#8217;s crimes and&nbsp;the railroading of our Constitution. I believe, and the majority of America knows, that&nbsp;this President can&#8217;t be legitimately acquitted because he never underwent a real trial.  The sham trial began ominously when Senator Mitch McConnell, in the dead of night, pushed&nbsp;through a set of trial rules without guarantees for key witnesses or documents and despite the Trump Administration&#8217;s blatant obstruction of Congress and the American people from hearing all the facts of the case. Nevertheless, the House managers presented a powerful case, proving to the American people that the President must be removed from office for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. As the President&#8217;s defense team presented its arguments, a shocking development heightened the urgent need for witness testimony and documents to be turned over to Congress that this&nbsp;Administration refused&nbsp;to provide. Friday night's vote by Republican Senators not to call witnesses and provide the public with a complete and unvarnished accounting of the President's scheme to bribe Ukraine with millions of dollars of badly needed military funding and equipment -- funds&nbsp;already approved by&nbsp;Congress -- in&nbsp;exchange for dirt on his political&nbsp;rival makes them complicit in&nbsp;the President's&nbsp;scheme.&nbsp;Without witnesses or evidence this is not a trial, it's a travesty.  Republicans in the House and Senate&nbsp;who have willingly gone&nbsp;along with&nbsp;the President's&nbsp;defense that anything he does, no matter how criminal or corrupt, is unimpeachable if he says it's in the public's interest has placed&nbsp;our entire system of government, the rule of law, and our Constitution in great peril. This is a moment in history that revealed&nbsp;those who&nbsp;had the courage and conviction to uphold their duty, and those who cared more about advancing the power of their party and hanging onto their seats.  Despite this historic low point, the Democratically controlled House continued with critical&nbsp;legislative business to benefit hardworking Americans and their families.&nbsp;I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to make it easier for military survivors to report sexual assaults. I also led a letter with 49 of my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women. Though the examples are numerous, the letter was prompted&nbsp;in light of his most recent comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing \"a good job\" on a reporter that Pompeo&nbsp;verbally attacked simply&nbsp;because she did her job.

On Friday, The New York Times reported that Bolton's manuscript contains details of the President directing Bolton to help with the President's pressure campaign&nbsp;on&nbsp;Ukraine, which dangled the promise of a White House meeting and critically needed&nbsp;funding for the fledgling democracy&nbsp;in exchange for a hit job&nbsp;on Trump&#8217;s political rival. The article states,&nbsp;&#8220;Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president&#8217;s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president&#8217;s impeachment defense.&#8221; That gun isn&#8217;t just smoking, the barrel is&nbsp;red hot and the trigger is covered with the President's grubby fingerprints. The Senate trial heads into its final&nbsp;conclusion&nbsp;next week following&nbsp;Senate Republicans vote&nbsp;Friday night against calling fact witnesses or requiring a shred of documentary evidence to be presented. Rest assured that&nbsp;my Democratic colleagues in the House and I will continue to fight the President's and Republicans' attempts to consolidate power in the Executive Branch and their cover-up&nbsp;of his crimes&nbsp;and corruption. America needs and demands the truth; we will not rest until all the facts are unearthed for the public's view and benefit.  Introduced Legislation to Make it Safe for Military Survivors to Report Assault On Thursday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague, Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE), to make it easier for sexual assault survivors across the military to report their assailants. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) expect to introduce companion legislation in the United States soon. Too many sexual assault survivors in our military and academies hesitate to report attacks because they fear they be punished for minor infractions&#8212;such as underage drinking or curfew violations&#8212;that may be uncovered during the assault investigation. Getting survivors to report these incidents so that they can access services and perpetrators can be held accountable is should be the focus of military leadership, not punishment of victims for minor misconduct. Our bill will ensure survivors cannot be punished for minor issues when they report an assault, unless aggravating circumstances exist. The Air Force Academy has already tested this program and seen positive results. Survivors and their loved ones should know that will fight hard to pass this legislation in this year&#8217;s National Defense Authorization Act, and that they are not alone.  Sent Letter to the President Condemning his Continuing Degradation of Women a letter to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women. The letter was sent on the heels of Secretary Pompeo disparaging NPR&#8217;s Mary Louise Kelly, a well-renowned journalist, for doing her job when she asked Pompeo about Ukraine. Kelly said that Pompeo shouted and swore at her and demanded she find the country on an unmarked map, which she did with no trouble. Pompeo then barred the reporter from covering his upcoming trip to Europe. The next day, President Trump validated this misogynistic and autocratic behavior by stating, &#8220;you did a good job on her.&#8221; Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, an esteemed career diplomat committed to anti-corruption reforms who the President referred to as &#8220;the woman&#8221; who is &#8220;going to go through some things&#8221; in the infamous July 25 call with President Zelensky, was yet another casualty. It is most shameful that the words young girls and boys hear directed at women from the upper echelons of power are dripping with disdain and disrespect. It is as if this President relishes the opportunity to publicly humiliate any woman who fights back, speaks up, or takes up space. As the women of the DWC admonished him in our letter, the President of the United States should set a moral example for our children, not be the biggest bully on the playground.    Where&#8217;s Jackie? Asked Defense Department About Remedial Action for Whistleblower Retaliation At a hearing this week of the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, we heard from a panel of government officials and experts on the need for stronger whistleblower protections in our laws. As Co-Chair of the House&#8217;s Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I have long advocated for whistleblower protection laws and have secured crucial legislative victories advancing rights to intelligence and congressional whistleblowers.  Much of the hearing focused on the huge backlog of 2,500 cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has been unable to function for over a year because President Trump and Senator McConnell have failed to fill seats on the board for quorum. I asked Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, why there possibly could be cases of illegal reprisals against whistleblowers that are substantiated during inspector general investigations and yet never result in compensation for the whistleblower. Fine agreed with me that there is a &#8220;disturbing&#8221; trend of defense agencies essentially ignoring inspector general recommendations to make whistleblowers whole, and that Congress must continue to put pressure and legislate to protect whistleblowers.  Armed Services Committee Hearing on Security of the Korean Peninsula On Tuesday, I pressed representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Intelligence Agency at the House Armed Services Committee&#8217;s hearing on the lack of a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea. The President gave Kim Jong-un multiple PR victories, praising him, meeting with him, and becoming the first U.S. President to set foot in North Korea, raising their global recognition and validating a regime never before recognized by Democratic or Republican Administrations. None of these displays got us any closer to containing the North Korean threat. Now, the Administration claims it&#8217;s applying a &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; campaign. However, it&#8217;s also pressuring and disrespecting our allies in South Korea and Japan, demanding outrageous increases to the billions of dollars our allies already contribute annually to our mutual defense. The President&#8217;s handling of the security region is erratic and dangerous. We must continue to demand a coherent strategy for dealing with our adversaries and hold this Administration&#8217;s feet to the fire for the safety and security of the region and our country.  Oversight Committee Hearing on &#8220;75 Years After the Holocaust: The Ongoing Battle Against Hate&#8221; Tuesday, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Additional hearings will be held in the coming weeks on voter suppression in minority communities, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim discrimination, anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions, and challenges facing LGBTQ individuals. As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I&#8217;ll also preside at a hearing next month on the dangers of white supremacist elements in our military.  Discussion on Poverty in the 21st Century and its Impact on Women As Co-Chair of the Democratic Women&#8217;s Caucus, I participated in a discussion on modern day poverty and its disproportionate impact on women. We heard from experts who explained the shocking reality that more people die of poverty in America than heart attacks and cancer combined. For millions of Americans, every day is a struggle to avoid eviction, put food on the table, or pay for just one doctor&#8217;s visit. Beyond these challenges, many women also take on the dual responsibilities of a traditional job and home and child care. This &#8220;social production&#8221; work constitutes a second job, but it&#8217;s not adequately valued in our society. In a particularly heart-breaking moment, I listened as one mother recounted her daughter&#8217;s struggle with cancer. Like many Americans struggling with inadequate health care, her daughter went to an emergency room after discovering a lump in her breast and was turned away without any additional care or tests due to her lack of health insurance. After months of no medical care, severe pains forced her back to the ER. The untreated cancer had spread through her entire body and caused her breast to completely rot off. As the wealthiest country in the world, it is a choice &#8211; not a forced reality &#8211; to not invest in affordable health care for every American. Indeed, the mother&#8217;s home state of Alabama opted out of the Medicaid expansion. No mother should have to watch her daughter die before her eyes knowing it was avoidable. Doubling rates of homelessness, hospital closures to make way for real estate development, and a complete lack of affordable dental care rounded out the discussion and further underscored the inhumane inequality growing in our country. We must remember that our nation&#8217;s successes cannot be fairly measured without considering everyone that has been left behind.    Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives from CalPERS  I am proud of all of California&#8217;s public employees and pleased that their retirement is in the hands of the trustworthy and forward-thinking managers at CalPERS.    Voices of California&#8217;s 14th District  Here are some issues they raised this week: &#8226; 96 constituents expressed their concern for the climate crisis. We must take bold action to combat climate change, end our addiction to fossil fuels, and grow our green economy. How we address climate change now will be the defining moment of this century. You have my word that I will be a vigorous advocate for bold action to solve this crisis so that we can leave a healthier planet for future generations. &#8226; 60 constituents shared their support for our public lands. For years, Republicans in Congress have waged a war against our public lands, introducing dangerous bills that threaten public land ownership and benefit special interest groups and corporate polluters at the expense of our environment. I have consistently voted against legislation that would allow state governments to sell or exploit public lands for profit and I have fought efforts to scale back protections under the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other critical environmental safeguards. &#8226; 22 constituents expressed their support for increased consumer safety regulations. As an avid proponent of consumer protection, I recognize the importance of improved labeling and consumer education campaigns and have introduced legislation to combat risks ranging from lead-filled children&#8217;s glasses to poisonous detergent pods. I am currently working on a bill to address the extensive contamination of PFAS, or forever chemicals, in cosmetics and personal care products.

Simply put, we cannot fight climate change without building a clean, energy-efficient economy. The legislation in my agenda aims to secure America&#8217;s path toward a sustainable future. Additionally, many of these bills have bipartisan support and demonstrate specific actions that Congress can take right away to reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to improve public health, strengthen our economy with green jobs, and protect the natural beauty we are so lucky to have in the Granite State. This week I also sat down with the Concord Chamber to discuss my Clean Energy Agenda and explore bipartisan solutions that can decarbonize our economy. From winter sports to maple harvesting, I look forward to my continued work to transition our state to a clean energy economy to protect all that makes the Granite State such a special place to call home. Empowering New Hampshire Businesses  This week I was glad to join community leaders at the New England Council (NEC) to give an update on my work in Congress and discuss how we can work together to grow New Hampshire&#8217;s economy and help our local businesses thrive. The NEC is a wonderful advocate for Granite State families and businesses &#8211; I look forward to our continued work together to ensure our state has the tools it needs to succeed and get ahead.       Working with community leaders to help the Granite State thrive.    Bipartisan Action to Prevent Fentanyl Overdoses&nbsp;  I led Wednesday&#8217;s House passage of the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. Fentanyl is killing people in New Hampshire and across the country. Communities throughout our state have been devastated by the opioid epidemic and we know that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are central to fueling this deadly crisis. We must use every tool available to reduce fatal fentanyl overdoses. On Wednesday, Congress took bipartisan action and averted disaster by ensuring that fentanyl remains a schedule 1 narcotic and members of our law enforcement community don&#8217;t have the rug pulled out from under them. I will continue to work across the aisle to ensure that we combat the opioid and substance abuse crisis from every angle.&nbsp;       Speaking on the House Floor about the legislation. Watch here.     USMCA Agreement Signed into Law  On Wednesday, President Trump signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. I voted in favor of the trade agreement last month, and I was glad to see Congress and the White House work together in a bipartisan way to get it over the finish line. Many Granite State businesses export goods and services to Canada and Mexico, and cross-border trade with our neighbors is crucial to the health and vitality of New Hampshire&#8217;s economy. The agreement signed on Wednesday includes provisions to enforce Mexico&#8217;s labor reforms and safeguard American jobs, more robust rules, and accountability mechanisms to protect our natural resources and improve access to Canadian markets for our dairy farmers.&nbsp;  In addition, House Democrats successfully blocked language in USMCA that would have raised prescription drug costs for Americans, and secured key enforcement provisions to protect American jobs and improve accountability with Mexican labor laws. The agreement that the President provided Congress had insufficient enforcement mechanisms in these key areas, and I was proud to work with my colleagues to fix these problematic aspects of USMCA. While I&#8217;m encouraged that the agreement includes improved environmental protections, there is more we can and must do to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. I look forward to my continued work to protect our environment, address climate change, and help the Granite State economy thrive. Honoring Christa McAuliffe  Tuesday marked the 34th anniversary of the Challenger disaster that took the life of Concord High School teacher Christa McAuliffe, along with the lives of fellow crew members Dick Scobee, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Mike Smith and Ellison Onizuka.&nbsp;  Everyone in New Hampshire remembers where they were on the day of the Challenger disaster. Our nation and the students who were privileged to have Christa McAuliffe as their teacher were heartbroken. Christa reached for the stars and inspired her students to do the same. I was honored to join my colleagues to help pass legislation just last year to create a commemorative coin to keep Christa&#8217;s pioneering spirit alive as she continues to spark a passion for science and exploration among younger generations.&nbsp;        Christa McAuliffe    My Guest at the State of the Union Next Week  I&#8217;m proud that Ross Cunningham, Superintendent of the Merrimack County Department of Corrections, will join me in Washington as my guest for the State of the Union Address next week. I deeply respect Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s extensive experience in our justice system and I am grateful for his dedication to ensuring vulnerable Granite Staters with substance use disorder can access the treatment they need. While we&#8217;ve made progress in our fight to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country, we have more work to do. Prevention, treatment and recovery go hand in hand with law enforcement in addressing substance misuse &#8211; we must end the cycle of addiction and incarceration. I&#8217;m glad to host Mr. Cunningham to signal our shared commitment to curbing substance use disorder and supporting those who struggle with addiction.  Here for You  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies. I was contacted by Patricia, a constituent from Littleton, who had an issue of concern regarding the Social Security Administration (SSA). My staff worked with SSA and helped resolve Patricia&#8217;s issue. If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help.  Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live. Have a great weekend!

Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, it&#8217;s easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t make progress by standing on the sidelines.&#8221; After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, we&#8217;re not surrendering. In fact, just the opposite: We&#8217;re fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect. It&#8217;s an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives. Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community. I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities. Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you. Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke     &nbsp;    Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents. Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve. Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market. These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act. The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home. In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments. The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers. Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings. I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act. This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex. My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes. New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.  &nbsp;     In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the President&#8217;s anti-immigrant agenda. My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R. 6) passed in the House of Representatives last year. According to H.R. 6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America. Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge.   Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the President&#8217;s xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus&#8217; newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, I&#8217;m committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census. It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community. We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive. Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts. Every person counts.        Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States. I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people. As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests.        Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities. Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R. 4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure. My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R. 4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on America&#8217;s national security.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residents&#8212;many in the Ninth District&#8212;were left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared. I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesn&#8217;t happen again. Brooklyn&#8217;s communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century. To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn. With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities. As a firm believer in Congress&#8217; ability to come together and combat this nation&#8217;s contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation.     I am proud that my bill H.R. 5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as &#8220;the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn.&#8221; My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy. Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007. At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing. Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all. In Major Owens&#8217; honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives.        My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell. This inaction is unacceptable. The fact is: background checks save lives. Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns. Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R. 1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm. From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence.        I&#8217;m proud that my bill, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act,&#8221; passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls. If you&#8217;ve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers. These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills. I know robocalls are more than annoying&#8212;they&#8217;re costly. My legislation, the &#8220;Ending One-Ring Scams Act.&#8221; will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.        Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you. Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents. That&#8217;s why I take every opportunity to celebrate the community, whether it&#8217;s dancing with my friends and constituents at the yearly West Indian Day Parade or eating food from local restaurants and vendors at street fairs, such as the Park Slope 5th Avenue Street Fair.

Safe travels back to the Natural State! The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act (), the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act (), the Never Again Education Act (), the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act (), the Global Hope Act (), a Resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests (), the Keeping Girls in School Act (), the Tibetan Policy Support Act (), the Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act (), the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act (), an Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the No War With Iran Act (), and an additional Amendment to H.R. 550 in the form of the Repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF ().  It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!&nbsp; This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month. David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead. They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation. Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .            Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico &#8211; two of Arkansas&#8217;s top trading partners. The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity.  For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs.  The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this week&#8217;s signing delivers a 21st&nbsp;century trade framework. This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural State&#8217;s world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansas&#8217;s hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families. Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansas&#8217;s exports. A&nbsp;&nbsp;from the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million. Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand. It&#8217;s exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December. By negotiating from strength &#8211; the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy. This landmark agreement puts America first! I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line. Promises made, promises kept! The President also announced his . The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people. With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East. No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone &#8211; and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation. On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future. Centuries of hostilities won&#8217;t be solved overnight &#8211; but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path. I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region.  It&#8217;s noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda. While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America. The results speak for themselves &#8211; thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created. &nbsp;In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations. We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory. Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year. On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic.  It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion. Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030. Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window. Our country&#8217;s unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt. Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030. To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget. We&#8217;ve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously. Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt. The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.  It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them. Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions &#8211; which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country. Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesn&#8217;t appear that we&#8217;ll have one this year either. In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year. Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, we&#8217;re not doing a budget.  It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face. We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people. Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State! I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies. I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith &#8211; who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association &#8211; to discuss the Community Development Block Grant program&nbsp;and other initiatives that support housing and community development.  The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators. It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the University&#8217;s priorities. I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas. I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas. They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development. I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell &#8211; and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District.  My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.&nbsp;We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare.  I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year. The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief. While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House. The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence. Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient.  Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith. The funding &#8211; awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA) &#8211; will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD). These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.  Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District. This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation. By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities. Learn more .

I, along with all of my Senate colleagues, were sworn in by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts. When the trial began, and the House managers came onto the Senate floor, I felt the weight of history, and a small catch in my throat. It was a relief to hear Representative Adam Schiff present the articles dispassionately, clearly and rationally. Looking out at my colleagues, I was struck by how rare it is that we are all on the floor together, sitting down free from technology, and focused on one thing. What would the Senate be like if we came together like this more often? What would happen if we did less tweeting and more listening? I will be sending other updates but here is my promise to Minnesotans: I take my oath extremely seriously and I will do impartial justice at this important moment in our nation's history. I'll also be posting my notes from the trial on social media each day. Here's my latest. Securing a Pathway to Citizenship for Liberians in Minnesota After decades of living and working legally in Minnesota, thousands of Liberians in Minnesota will finally have a chance to become citizens, thanks to the organizing and advocacy of the Liberian community and an amendment that I fought for in the Senate and worked hard to get passed into law. Liberians, many of whom fled a violent civil war in Liberia, were granted what's known as DED status, a humanitarian protection that had allowed them to live and work in this country for more than 25 years. But their status had to be renewed each year, and for some time, it looked like the Trump Administration might terminate these important protections, even though conditions in Liberia are still dangerous and uncertain. That's why I championed an amendment with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, all while working closely with the Liberian community, that gives Liberians a pathway to citizenship in the United States and allows them to apply for green cards. It passed both chambers of Congress and was signed by the President himself. I could not be happier. We did it. You can see some photos of the celebration I attended in St. Paul here. Successfully Fighting to Make Protections for Federal Health Benefits During Government Shutdown Law of the Land Last year, I received a heartbreaking note from a furloughed federal worker in Minnesota whose son was born prematurely during the most recent government shutdown. There was uncertainty surrounding what government functions were operating, and his family faced confusion about the status of insurance coverage for their son's stay at the newborn intensive care unit. No family should have to deal with something like this. I fought hard to make sure federal employees who have qualifying life events are able to make the proper adjustments to their health insurance plans and continue dental and vision benefits during lapses in federal funding. And now, that's the law of the land after passing as part of measures signed into law in December as part of the National Defense Reauthorization Act (NDAA). Similar bipartisan legislation was introduced in the House by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who fought to include these measures in NDAA before his passing. I made a promise to help families and workers in Minnesota and across the country, and I'm proud to say that this bill makes good on that promise. You can read more about the bill here. Working Across the Aisle to Combat Lyme Disease With the number of Lyme disease cases on the rise, I worked with Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine to include a bill that would improve research, prevention, diagnostics, and treatment for vector-borne diseases, which are spread by ticks, mosquitoes and fleas. The incidence of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases has increased significantly since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting began in 1991. Minnesota had 950 confirmed cases of Lyme diseases in 2018 and last month, our bipartisan bill was signed into law to address this serious problem. I worked closely together with Senator Collins to get the Kay Hagan TICK Act passed, but now we are making sure that our bill is properly implemented. We recently pressed the Trump Administration to make implementing this bill a top priority. That means we are looking for them to develop a national strategy to address this along with delivering support to states so we can build a public health infrastructure that can combat tick-borne diseases effectively.

Safe travels back to the Natural State!  The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including a Resolution to approve a request from the Department of Veterans Affairs to pursue a pilot program to increase veteran access to dental care (H. J. Res. 80), the Homeless Assistance Act (), the Prudential Regulator Oversight Act (), the Expanding Opportunity for Minority Depository Institutions Act (), the Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience Act (), the President George H.W. Bush and First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act (), the 8-K Trading Gap Act (H.R. 4335), which requires the SEC to issue new rules prohibiting executives from trading during the four-day gap between when a significant event that impacts the company happens and when the company publicly files a Form 8-K to alert the public and shareholders of the event, the Veteran HOUSE Act (), a Resolution appointing and authorizing managers for the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, President of the United States (), the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (), and a Resolution providing for Congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to \"Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability\" (). Unfair trade practices and policies have allowed countries to win on the backs of hardworking Americans. For decades, China and many other players have taken advantage of the United States. The result has been jobs moved overseas, stolen intellectual property, currency manipulation, limited market access, and lost opportunity.  That changed when President Trump took office. One of his top priorities is to put America first and secure fair and reciprocal trade deals. He made clear that having a seat at the table isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; we need to be leading on issues that matter to the United States. And, this week, a momentous step was taken as the President signed Phase One of a historic trade agreement with China. With the advancement of this deal, we are righting wrongs that have hurt U.S. businesses, farmers, and families &#8211; and securing a more prosperous future for our exceptional nation. This fully enforceable agreement rebalances our vital trade partnership with China and boosts opportunity for American businesses, farmers, manufacturers, and innovators.&nbsp;Key provisions include:   American-made products: China has pledged to increase imports of American goods and services by at least $200 billion. &nbsp; Agriculture purchases: China will be purchasing billions of dollars' worth of goods from U.S. farmers. Market access: Decreased barriers for U.S. products, including beef, pork, rice, wheat, dairy, and more. No more forced technology transfers: For the first time ever, China agreed to end its practice of forcing American companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies as a condition for doing business there. Fairer currency practices: Beijing has agreed to stronger commitments on its practices regarding currency devaluations and exchange rates.  This isn&#8217;t the only recent trade win for our nation. Thanks to the President and the diligent work of U.S trade representatives, China reopened its markets to poultry &#8211; which was shuttered for years &#8211; and we have negotiated fairer policies with Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Canada. On top of that, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the critical USMCA passed the Senate this week and is now headed to the White House for signature! This agreement with Mexico and Canada provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity with two of our top trading partners. With a roaring economy and new trade deals with global partners, it&#8217;s evident now more than ever that pro-growth policies and strong leadership are ushering in a new era of prosperity, success, and growth.  Unfortunately, the concentration on delivering tangible results to the American people is not a priority shared by all of my colleagues. While President Trump signed the Phase One trade deal, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was handing out pens and posing for pictures smiling as she initialed documents to send articles of impeachment to the Senate. The contrast in agendas between parties couldn&#8217;t be more clear than those two images. As President Trump and Republicans fight to deliver wins to U.S. families, workers, farmers, and consumers, the Democrats remain transfixed with trying to remove a duly-elected President. Imagine the progress that could be made if all of Congress were focused on issues that contribute to the strength of the U.S. In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State and have a great Arkansan testify before the House Budget Committee. It was my distinct honor and privilege to welcome Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) Secretary Larry Walther to speak at a hearing titled &#8220;Why Federal Investments Matter: Stability from Congress to State Capitals.&#8221; Secretary Walther brought perspectives on Arkansas&#8217;s budget and planning processes, including the state&#8217;s focus on fiscal responsibility. As he noted, &#8220;Arkansas maintains a true balanced budget approach to funding state programs. We do not commit state dollars until we have those dollars in hand and available to spend.\" This focus on fiscal responsibility is something that Washington could use more of. The power dynamic between the federal government and state and local governments has become greatly skewed, overly dominated by federal control, and far out of line from what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The point is that state and local governments, along with private sector innovation, are best equipped to address domestic needs. The federal government should focus on finding more opportunities to stay out of the way.  At the hearing, . It is in the best interest of all to promote policies that reduce the federal imprint on state and local governments and encourage these institutions to address an increasing number of our nation&#8217;s domestic policy concerns. One-size-fits-all policies from bureaucrats sitting here in Washington do little to solve problems or address needs in Arkansas&#8217;s Third Congressional District or any other location far outside the Beltway. I thank Secretary Walther for his testimony and time.  I then sat down with Ferra Aerospace, an advanced machining and complex assembly company that is opening a facility in Rogers. Ferra's Arkansas facility will provide services to many leading companies including Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. I am thrilled that Ferra Aerospace is establishing a precision manufacturing facility in the Third District. The engineering and manufacturing talent in our region is second to none, and it&#8217;s notable that this global aerospace company is expanding into the Natural State. I welcome Ferra and its leadership to Rogers and look forward to working together to create jobs, grow the local economy, and support our military and defense industries. I wrapped up the week by sitting down with Brynt Parmeter, Walmart&#8217;s new Senior Director of Military Programs. Walmart is committed to supporting service members and their families, providing strong military spouse programs and veteran hiring commitments.&nbsp;Since launching&nbsp;the Military Spouse Career Connection (MSCC) on Veterans Day 2018, Walmart has hired more than 14,000 military spouses and remains ahead of schedule to meet its goal of hiring 250,000 military veterans by the end of 2020. Leadership, integrity, and commitment to service make our veterans outstanding employees. I&#8217;m pleased that many companies in AR-3 make it a priority to help service members transition back into civilian life and find new careers that leverage their skills.  Wishing you a great weekend, and I hope to see you around the Third District next week!

I hope you had a great time ringing in the new decade with your friends and loved ones. When reflecting on the past year, I'm proud of what I've accomplished together.&nbsp; As a new year begins, it&#8217;s time to hit the ground running. I wanted to give you an update on what I've been doing to start 2020.   Protecting Americans Against Terrorism Last week marked a momentous occasion in our nation&#8217;s recent history, when President Trump green-lit a targeted strike to take out Iranian General Soleimani, the leader of Iran's military terrorist unit responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans. Iran retaliated with attacks on American servicemembers stationed in Iraq. I&#8217;m thankful that no American blood was shed during these attacks and continue to pray for our men and women in uniform. The President sent a strong message to the world &#8211; the United States stands against terrorism and a nuclear Iran. However, in an unprecedented attempt to tie the President&#8217;s hands, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats unfortunately passed a War Powers Resolution, an irresponsible move that makes it harder for the President and brave men and women in uniform to do their jobs and keep our nation safe. I voted against this resolution, and hope that the Senate will as well.   Putting an End to Veteran Suicide Every day, our country tragically loses 20 veterans to suicide, a crisis that continues to grow despite efforts by the VA to intervene. Twenty a day is 20 too many, and something must be done to end this crisis plaguing the veteran community. I am proud to tell you that a bipartisan bill I introduced, the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act, was recently signed into law by the President. This new law will ensure that Suicide Prevention Coordinators &#8211; the VA professionals who identify veterans at risk for suicide &#8211; have the tools they need to support vulnerable veterans.&nbsp;Working together, we can help ensure veterans have the resources they need during their time of need and let them know that they are not alone.      Compensating Blue Water Navy Veterans After the Vietnam War, almost 100,000 Blue Water Navy veterans became ill due to exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides during their service. Last year, a bill I cosponsored to ensure these veterans receive proper benefits was signed into law. If you are a Vietnam veteran who was impacted by Agent Orange exposure, I have some important information for you. The VA is now adjudicating claims for disability compensation and other benefits related to Agent Orange exposure. All Blue Water Navy veterans can apply, even if you have been previously denied. To learn more or to file a claim, please click here or call 1-800-749-8387     Recognizing Service Academy Nominees Southern Illinois is home to some of the brightest young people in the country. With Scott Air Force Base in our back yard, it's easy to see why service to our nation is an important value within the communities in Illinois's 12th District.&nbsp;Every year, I'm honored to nominate a select number of Southern Illinois' best and brightest to our nation&#8217;s service academies. I recently held a ceremony to thank this year&#8217;s nominees for their patriotism and celebrate their hard work. As our next generation of leaders, they have incredibly bright futures ahead.     The Partisan Impeachment Drags On This impeachment process has become so long and drawn out that even Democrats have had enough. For months, Speaker Pelosi has been saying that impeachment is an urgent national interest. Yet, she has withheld the articles of impeachment from the Senate for over three weeks.&nbsp;Members of both sides of the aisle can see straight through the games and it's time to move on and work on issues that actually impact Americans.   It's been a great start to the year, and I'm optimistic about the direction we're heading. Hope you have a great week!  -Mike                    WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 1440 Longworth HouseOffice BuildingWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-5661Fax: (202) 225-0285 O'FALLON OFFICE 302 West State St.O'Fallon, IL 62269Phone: (618) 622-0766Fax: (618) 622-0774 CARBONDALE OFFICE 300 East Main StreetSuite 4&nbsp;Carbondale, IL 62901Phone: (618) 457-5787Fax: (618) 457-2990          Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window | Click here to open a plain text version of this email Unsubscribe&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;          ","district":"12","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"IL","party":"Republican","score":3.6593218},{"name":"Congressman Jared Huffman","address":"CA02JH.Enews@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2020-01-10","subject":"2019 Rewind: End of the Year Newsletter","body":", and follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.     I believe in practical solutions to our nation's most pressing issues, and I look for opportunities to work across the aisle. In 2019, the first year of the 116th&nbsp;Congress, I introduced 27 bills with a total of 726 bipartisan cosponsors. Unfortunately, Mitch McConnell has refused to allow the Senate to vote on over 275 bipartisan bills that have passed the House and would improve the lives of Americans on issues like gun violence prevention, health care, the environment, and raising the minimum wage. I will not tolerate petty partisanship and will continue to work across the aisle to get things done for CA-02. Let's look back on the efforts of this past year as we look forward to more success in 2020:    H.R. 1146 The Arctic&nbsp;and Coastal Plan Protection Act   Repeals the drilling mandate from President Trump's 2017 tax law, which was added as a handout to Big Oil and special interests. Passed the House with bipartisan support 09/12/2019. Has over 180 cosponsors&nbsp;-- the most for any bill ever introduced to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  H.R. 310 The West Coast Ocean Protection Act   Blocks offshore oil and gas drilling in federal waters along the West Coast. The House voted to pass this as part of H.R. 1941, which protects the Pacific, Atlantic, and Eastern Gulf of Mexico.  H.R. 2250 The Northwest California Wilderness, Recreation, and Working Forests Act   Approved by the House Natural Resources Committee with bipartisan support. Increases fire resilience, restores forests and fish habitat, rehabilitates lands impaired by illegal marijuana growing operations, increases recreation opportunities through new trails and visitor centers, and permanently protects many of northwest California&#8217;s most spectacular wild places and pristine streams.&nbsp;  H.R. 5091 The Wildfire Defense Act   Empowers communities to implement science-based methods for mitigating wildfires, including by creating community-scale defensible space to slow or stop the spread of fire. Provides funding to design and implement new Community Wildfire Defense Plans developed by community members, first responders, and relevant state agencies.  H.R. 1878 IDEA Full Funding Act   Creates a 10 year plan to hold the federal government accountable for the full 40% of funding for special education promised by Congress in the 1975 IDEA Act. Ensures&nbsp;that every child with a disability has access to educational opportunity. Includes $12.8 billion for IDEA funding in the FY 2020 House, increasing the budget by $400 million, the largest increase since 2015.  See my remarks on Impeachment here.       Town Hall in Point Reyes, read more&nbsp;here.  I have always been impressed with how engaged our community is. At thirteen town halls up and down CA-02, I heard from you directly and answered your questions about Congress' work and the news from Washington. I know that by creating solutions together, we succeed together.    Representative Huffman at fisheries listening tour, Credit: Thomas Hedges  In the same spirit, I began a listening tour to hear from stakeholders who care about sustainable fisheries in the United States. As the Chair of the Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Subcommittee, I have traveled coast-to-coast to hold four listening sessions in 2019 and plan to continue this year as part of my larger goal to foster a more transparent, deliberative, and science-based process for developing legislation. I cannot wait to share and learn more this coming year.       When I was elected Chairman of the Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Subcommittee at the beginning of 2019, I set out to provide much-needed oversight of the Trump administration, improve the health of our oceans and economy of our coastal communities, respond to the threat that climate change poses to sustainable water supplies, and advance smart solutions to natural resources challenges. This past year I held 21 meetings where we considered 44 bills on a range of topics: climate impacts, public lands, biodiversity loss, coastal resilience, endangered species, trophy hunting, pollution, and illegal fishing. We still have a long journey ahead, but my resolve to meet the challenge is stronger than ever in 2020. &nbsp;  &nbsp;    As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am working to solve climate problems, make sure our waterways are contributing to the economy, and boost smart transportation solutions. I just introduced  the GREEN Streets Act&nbsp;to reduce emissions from the U.S. transportation sector and cut down on long commutes. Additionally, we held hearings on disaster preparedness and the dangers of irresponsible projects like the Pebble Mine that will harm the California salmon fishing industry, and worked to secure resources for more resources to dredge the Petaluma River, expand the SMART Train, and make long term plan for Last Chance Grade.   Looking ahead into 2020, there is a lot of uncertainty in the economy, and there is a lot of work to be done to defend our democracy. I am grateful to represent such an engaged group of citizens, and I am looking forward to pushing forward legislation that will protect clean air and water, work for the people, and conduct tough oversight over the Trump administration and stand against President Trump's attempts to erode our democracy.  Thank you for a wonderful 2019. I hope this year to come brings joy, good health, and happiness to you and your loved ones.

Although it won&#8217;t totally solve the problem, it should help. Let me know if unsolicited calls have become a serious issue for you.&nbsp;  Vern   Trump signs robo-call bill into law Caroline Kelly  President Donald Trump signed a bill on Monday that increases fines on criminal robocall violations and cracks down on companies making the calls, as part of a federal push against telephone scammers.  \"This historic legislation will provide American consumers with even greater protection against annoying unsolicited robocalls,\" the White House Office of the Press Secretary said of the TRACED Act.&nbsp;  \"American families deserve control over their communications, and this legislation will update our laws and regulations to stiffen penalties, increase transparency, and enhance government collaboration to stop unwanted solicitation.\"  The move comes as part of crackdown against the targeting companies and individuals who have collectively placed more than 1 billion unwanted calls for financial schemes and other services.&nbsp;  Monday's bill, which passed in the Senate in May and the House earlier this month, came following the Federal Communications Commission's announcement of a nationwide crackdown on illegal robocalls in June.  The legislation imposes stiffer fines of as much as $10,000 per call on robocallers who knowingly flout the rules on calls and instructs the FCC to develop further regulations that could shield consumers from unwanted calls. It will also accelerate the rollout of so-called \"call authentication\" technologies the industry is currently developing, which could cut down on the number of calls coming from unverified numbers.  Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and cosponsor of the bill, pointed to its bipartisan support in a statement earlier this month anticipating the President's signature.  \"I have yet to meet someone who says they enjoy receiving those unwanted and illegal robocalls that plague our phones, whether we're at home, at work, or in the car, which is why the TRACED Act takes several important steps in the fight to curb this scourge,\" he said. He called the measure \"a significant win for consumers in every corner of the country, and it finally and officially puts illegal robocallers on notice.\"  Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey said that, by passing the legislation, the Senate \"sent Americans a holiday gift on everyone's list: stopping the plague of robocalls.\"  \"The annoying and harassing robocalls we receive every day are neither a Democrat nor Republican menace; they are a universal menace,\" he added.  The law isn't the only measure being taken to target the calls. The FCC voted in June to give wireless carriers like Verizon the green light to block unwanted robocalls automatically for all customers. In August, 12 of the nation's largest telecommunications companies and attorneys general from all 50 states plus Washington, DC, announced a voluntary agreement to prevent and punish illegal robocallers.           &nbsp;       Sarasota District Office&nbsp; 111 South Orange Avenue Floor 2R, Suite 202W Sarasota, FL 34236 Phone: (941) 951-6643 Fax: (941) 951-2972  Bradenton District Office&nbsp; 1051 Manatee Ave West Suite 305 Bradenton, FL 34205 Phone: (941) 747-9081 Fax: (941) 748-1564         Washington D.C.

As we move past the holiday season and get into the swing of everyday routines, I want to continue updating you on the latest events in West Texas and in our nation's capital. While it is a new year, the same partisan sham has continued with Speaker Pelosi refusing to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, wielding a power over our democratic process that far exceeds her constitutional duties. See below for a glimpse of last week and be sure to follow me on&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and like my page on&nbsp;Facebook to receive all the latest updates from Washington and across West Texas.   America's Military Readiness in the Face of Iranian Threat  Last week, President Trump ordered a game-changing U.S. military attack that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, among other military officials at Baghdad International Airport. After hundreds of American deaths, repeated raids on American soldiers, and recent as well as planned attacks on our embassy in Iraq, taking out the leader of the Iranian-backed terrorist group responsible for all of this was both necessary and appropriate. Our Commander-in-Chief was clear: we are not looking for war or regime change, but we will not tolerate terrorist threats to Americans anywhere in the world.&nbsp;Donald J. Trump&nbsp;has shown great restraint with Iran, but America&#8217;s patience must not be mistaken as weakness. To read more, click&nbsp;here&nbsp;or the image below.

My colleague on the other side of the aisle, Rep. Al Green, laid out the Democrats intentions well. He said, Im concerned that if we dont impeach this president, he will get re-elected. Democrats passed their articles of impeachment in the most partisan impeachment vote in our history, with zero Republicans voting aye. While those pushing for an illegitimate impeachment have been loud, Ive fought through the noise and distractions for you and the First District. In reality, America under President Trump is thriving. Unemployment is at a five-decade low. Two million jobs were created in 2019. There were 266,000 new jobs in November alone, blowing past the expected 180,000. The stock market is booming and President Trumps trade deal is finally moving through Congress. The United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA) that was approved by the House with my support is estimated to add $68.2 billion to the U.S. economy and spur 176,000 jobs. The USMCA is a win for American workers. After years of work to get this across the finish line, President Trump signed my measure to expand and protect Fort Frederica National Monument into law. It will preserve the history and legacy of this landmark for many generations to come. This year we secured the highest level of construction funding in the projects history for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project. While we scored a big win this year, I will continue fighting until this vital project is completed. One of my top priorities this year, and every year, is to provide the resources necessary to strengthen the First Districts military presence. I am proud that I was able to secure funding for new hangars at Hunter Army Airfield and the Air Dominance Center in Savannah. Ive seen the severe need for new hangars first hand. Our troops should be the most well-prepared and well-equipped force on the planet and I will do everything in my power to ensure they are. I am also very glad that we were able to provide military members with an extremely well deserved pay raise  the largest in a decade. In recent years, our agriculture community has faced hard hits. In Georgia, agriculture is our top industry and entire communities are hurt when there is a disaster. In 2017, Georgia was expected to produce around 90 million pounds of blueberries, but was drastically reduced to 30 million because of a freeze combined with warm winter weather. In 2018, growers faced another freeze and another year of significant losses. We were able to secure the assistance needed to recover from the devastating losses. On the Energy and Commerce Committee, we created and passed legislation to end robocalls. Robocalls are not only an annoyance, they can be a security threat and weve even seen them block hospital lines. Also on the Energy and Commerce Committee, weve been working with President Trump to create bipartisan solutions to lower costs. We introduced a bipartisan proposal that will lower prescription drug costs while encouraging the innovation of new cures for diseases like Alzheimers, ALS and cancer. Additionally, legislation I introduced to increase transparency in the drug supply chain was approved by the House this year. This year, we had the privilege of assisting nearly 3,000 constituents through casework  everything from missing veterans benefits to lost passports. In DC, we saw many friendly faces and gave over 200 tours of the U.S. Capitol. I always want to hear from you, and we responded to more than 22,000 constituent emails, letters and calls. Although extraordinary, 2019 was a great year and Im blessed to have been able to see so many of you across the district at events, community meetings, high school football games and more. As we enter a new year, Im committed to continuing this critical work with President Trump and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress to deliver results. Serving the First District, my home, has been one of the greatest honors of my life and I look forward to seeing you in the new year. THE DEATH OF AN IRANIAN TERRORIST LEADER This week, at the direction of President Trump, the United States military took action to eliminate Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian terrorist leader and a head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. There is no question about it, Soleimani was a terrorist with American blood on his hands. He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and innocent civilians in the region, and was planning to continue his attacks. While Iran chanted \"Death to America,\" previous administrations cowered. Instead, President Trump is using a decisive, tactical and justified strategy against escalating Iranian aggression. I am glad that President Trump is making it very clear that the United States of America will not stand for attacks against Americans and our troops, and we will fight back FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXLVII Monday, December 23, 2019: For many people, including myself, the Christmas holiday season is the most wonderful time of the year. Spending time with family and friends and celebrating the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ makes this time of year especially enjoyable.  Rep. Carter has lunch with troops at Hunter Army Airfield While I have enjoyed many special times this holiday season, perhaps none is as special as having lunch with about 25 of our troops at Hunter Army Airfield today. Although it is a very impromptu visit, I am honored to share time with these heroes who, although away from home and working during this special time, are still excited to celebrate the season. Home for these heroes is from all across our great country - Las Vegas, Raleigh, Albany, San Diego, etc. And while Im sure they all would like to be back home with their loved ones, their dedication to their work and their service to our country is clearly not deterred.  Rep. Carter at Union Mission's Grace House I also have the opportunity to visit Union Missions Grace House in downtown Savannah where holiday meals for over 300 people, many homeless, are being served today and where they are handing out hundreds of gifts including clothing and shoes. Today was indeed a very special day.  Tuesday, December 24, 2019: Im in Nahunta in Brantley County today at the Okefenokee Rural Electric Cooperative where I meet family and friends of Brantley County High School (BCHS) student Porter Mobley as we prepare to surprise him with the news that he has received an appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Porters dad works at the Cooperative and is an integral part of our scheme as he has coaxed Porter into coming to work with him today dressed in his ROTC uniform for a picture session. Also present are Brantley County School Superintendent Dr. Kim Morgan, BCHS Principal Dr. Ben Horner, AJROTC Commander Col. Rick Chapman as well as many family and friends and the local press. I have met Porter on a few occasions and, while he is surprised to see me, he still has no idea why Im there for a picture session and, I suspect, has no idea why his teachers, family and friends are there.  Rep. Carter announcing Porter Mobley's appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy As we all gather around and I announce to this fine young man the exciting news of his appointment, the pride and joy of all those gathered is obvious. While I believe Porter is the first student from Brantley County to ever receive an appointment to one of our countrys service academies, I am certain that he wont be the last. Afterwards, I head to the Darien United Methodist Church in McIntosh County for their Christmas Eve luncheon at Charlies Place.  Rep. Carter at the Christmas Eve Luncheon at Charlie's Place Although this is a special luncheon because it is Christmas Eve, a free lunch is served every Tuesday for the community here at Charlies Place.

Congressman Hagedorn has been hard at work for you the people of the First District, including advocating for USMCA's passage in the House and seeing his Small Business Committee priorities signed into law. Language from Rep. Hagedorn&#8217;s bipartisan bill, H.R. 5146, the &#8220;Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019,&#8221; was signed into law by President Trump on December 20 as an amendment included in the 2020 NDAA. For more updates from Rep. Hagedorn subscribe to his newsletter and follow him on Facebook and Twitter.  1.

Hagedorn wrote, &#8220;Even the highest-ranking member of this body publicly stated that this process has been two and a half years in the making.

Click here to read more in the Washington Examiner. Unlike Pelosi, House Republicans have a bipartisan cure for prescription drug costs As physicians and healthcare providers, and now policymakers, we believe that innovation will drive the cost of healthcare down more than any new law or policy. Whether here in Congress or in our office as a physician, we strive to keep patients out of the hospital and at home and healthy with their loved ones. Having the best tools and medicine in our toolkit helps us achieve that mission. Patients deserve access to cutting-edge medicine that is going to treat, and maybe even cure, Alzheimers or diabetes. We need to make sure the next miracle drug sitting in the approval pipeline that could cure childhood cancers, as well as metastatic breast, lung, skin, prostate, or pancreatic cancers, are more quickly available for your loved ones. Lives literally depend on it. While we were in medical, pharmacy and dental school, there were simply no cures or good treatment options for most cancers, leukemia, hepatitis, depression, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Within the last decade, weve seen groundbreaking medical miracles. One notable example is former President Jimmy Carter, who had widespread metastatic melanoma and was treated by a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Thanks to American research and ingenuity, we have medicine unlike the world has ever seen, such as CAR T-cell therapy. Two therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration within the last two years to defeat lymphoma and acute pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia. More recently, the FDA approved a miracle drug for cystic fibrosis, which affects 30,000 Americans. And, finally, its worth mentioning that just six years ago, Hepatitis C was a death sentence. Thanks to investments in innovation, 3.5 million people with Hepatitis C can now take a pill once a week for 12 weeks and be completely cured. None of these treatments would have been made available if it werent for the United States protecting innovation and encouraging innovators to be pioneers. Last year, national healthcare spending reached $3.6 trillion. About one-third of all healthcare spending is tied to hospital care, while prescription drugs make up 9%. About 28% of the federal budget is now being spent directly on healthcare. If we are ever going to balance the federal budget, we must get the cost of healthcare under control. Protecting and streamlining the next miracle drugs is an obvious way to help do that. We cannot even begin to guess what the savings to Medicare costs would be if we had the cure for Alzheimers and dementia and other illnesses where Medicare is the single largest payer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently introduced, and the House passed, H.R. 3, a government price-fixing bill that would absolutely decimate private research and development for potential future miracle drugs to come to market. As with any other industry, the federal government takeover of medicine will halt innovation and lower quality. While it may seem popular today to demonize Western medicine, America is still the gold standard and global leader in cutting-edge medicine. Of note, of the 270 drugs that have come to the world market since 2011, 100% are available to patients in America, compared to 8% in China, 41% in Australia, 52% in Canada, and 67% in Germany. With that said, as policymakers, we recognize the need to balance innovation while appropriately addressing shortcomings in our system. Were addressing these failures head-on. Our solution is H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. The provisions in this legislation are bipartisan and will lower out-of-pocket patient spending, protect access to new medicines and cures, strengthen transparency, and champion competition. We want to promote innovation, which requires government getting out of the way  not more government red tape. H.R. 19 will make the process for FDA drug approval far more streamlined and, among other things, promote generic competition. Finally, for the first time ever, this bill provides seniors and Medicare recipients a cap on out-of-pocket drug spending, which allows them to budget their out-of-pocket expenses annually. We want to reiterate that every single provision in this legislative alternative is bipartisan. H.R. 19 could actually become law. We truly can lower drug costs for consumers without destroying innovation, unlike with H.R. 3. Thanks to the Trump administrations leadership, people now have twice the number of generic drugs approved per year in comparison to the previous administration, and the actual costs of prescriptions have gone down slightly for the first time in modern medical history. This is just the beginning. Republicans are ready to do more to work together with Democrats to lower prescription drug prices without killing ingenuity with government control. As physicians and healthcare providers, we will continue to advocate for incentivizing good health and prevention. Lets get to work and deliver meaningful solutions to all. By GOP Reps.

So far, we have passed and sent to the Senate more than 400 bills, of which 275 are bipartisan. &nbsp;Here is a look back at just some of the incredible legislation that we passed in the House in 2019:   H.R. 1 &#8211; For The People Act, to restore confidence in our democracy; H.R. 3 &#8211; Lower Drug Costs Now Act, sweeping legislation to dramatically reduce drug prices by giving Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies; making lower drug prices negotiated by Medicare available to Americans with private insurance, not just Medicare beneficiaries; and stopping drug companies from ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the same drugs; H.R. 4 &#8211; Voting Rights Advancement Act, to finally restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act after the disastrous 2013 Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court decision; H.R. 5 &#8211; Equality Act, to finally and fully end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans; H.R. 6 &#8211; American Dream and Promise Act, to provide a pathway to lawful permanent residence (and eventual citizenship) to those who have lived most of their lives in this country, including Dreamers and TPS and DED holders; H.R. 7 &#8211; Paycheck Fairness Act, to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work; H.R. 8 &#8211; Bipartisan Background Checks Act, a commonsense measure to require background checks for all gun sales, closing the gun show and online loopholes; and also&nbsp;H.R. 1112 &#8211; Enhanced Background Checks Act,&nbsp;to close the Charleston loophole; H.R. 9 &#8211; Climate Action Now Act, to ensure that the U.S. honors our commitments on climate action detailed in the Paris Agreement; H.R. 582 &#8211; Raise the Wage Act, to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, raising the wages of&nbsp; up to 33 million hard-working Americans; H.R. 987 &#8211; Protecting People With Pre-Existing Conditions/Lowering Drug Costs, to strengthen protections for pre-existing conditions, end ACA sabotage, and bring down drug costs; H.R. 1585 &#8211; Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, a strong improvement and long-term reauthorization of VAWA; H.R. 1644 &#8211; Save the Internet Act, to protect the free and open internet for all; H.R. 2722 &#8211; Securing America&#8217;s Federal Elections (SAFE) Act, to ensure the security and safety of our elections by upgrading our outdated and vulnerable election infrastructure; H.R. 4617 &#8211; Stopping Harmful Interference In Elections For A Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, which focuses on preventing foreign interference in our elections, including requiring campaigns to notify the FBI if a foreign power seeks to provide campaign assistance. H.R. 5068 &#8211; Farm Workforce Modernization Act, to honor workers&#8217; dignity and support the farm economy; and H.R. 5430 &#8211; United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, which, thanks to Democrats&#8217; changes, now has the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any U.S. trade agreement, as well as critical victories for workers, lower prescription drug costs and environmental protections.  We continue to call on Senator McConnell, the Grim Reaper, to take up our legislation For The People, so that we can deliver results for families and seniors across America!  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Happy Holidays The holiday season offers a special opportunity to reflect on the miraculous blessings of family, community and Country.&nbsp; As we celebrate in the company of our loved ones, I want to express my continued and profound gratitude for the honor of representing you in the Congress. &nbsp;Please accept my best wishes for a happy holiday and Happy New Year to you and your family.&nbsp;  With so many reasons to celebrate this year, it is important to remember to be safe.

Maloney Dear Lindsey, What a year we've had! It's hard to believe that 2019 is coming to an end. With a new year--and decade--ahead, I wanted to take a look back at all that we accomplished together this year. We got a lot done working for the American people, including: - Securing permanent funding of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund; - Becoming the first woman ever to chair the Committee on Oversight and Reform; - Reauthorizing the Debbie Smith Act to provide funding to test backlogged DNA kits; and - Impeaching the President Read more on all of this and more below. *Turning Promise Into Law: Honoring Our 9/11 Heroes * [image = *Congresswoman Maloney speaks at a press conference on the passage of *the Never Forget the Heroes Act* In February, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund announced that due to a funding shortfall, injured and ill 9/11 responders and survivors would receive significant cuts to their pending and future claims. I could not allow that. Fully funding and permanently authorizing the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund was the least we could do to honor the sacrifices of these brave men and women. After months of bipartisan work, during which i wore a firefighter jacket every day to reming my colleagues about the importance of making the program permanent, my bill, the Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, was signed into law in July. This would not have been possible without the incredible community of first responders, survivors their families who advocated tirelessly for this life saving legislation. With this bill, and the World Trade Center Health Program, the 9/11 community and their families now have a greater sense of security knowing that these resources will always be there for them. *Becoming the First Female Chair of The Committee on Oversight and Reform* In November, my House Democratic colleagues elected me as the new Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. I will do my best to follow the honorable example that the late Chairman Cummings left for us all. When I first came to Congress, I wanted to join this committee because it fights corruption, ensures transparency, and protects the American people. Today, these responsibilities are more important than ever. It is a great honor to chair the Oversight Committee, and I am humbled by the additional honor of being the committee's first woman chair. *Ensuring Funding to Reduce the DNA Testing Backlog* Across the country, DNA evidence sits backlogged and untested because forensic labs lack the resources to process it. That's why, in 2004, I wrote and passed the Debbie Smith Act. The legislation provided much-needed resources to law enforcement agencies to process untested DNA evidence. The National Institute of Justice reports that since 2005, Debbie Smith funding is responsible for 192,000 - or about 42% - of DNA matches in the FBI database. As importantly, it also provides some measure of justice to survivors of violence. Although the program lapsed for a few months, I am proud to say that the bill passed the Senate in December and is on its way to the President's desk. *Impeaching the President* Impeachment is not something that I take lightly. I took no pleasure in learning what I feel is disturbing information that led me to conclude that the House of Representatives must impeach the President. I did not come to Congress to impeach a president, but I feel that he has left us no choice based on his actions. I am proud of the honest, detailed investigative work that the Committee on Oversight and Reform did towards writing the impeachment report and in supporting the work of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. I cannot thank the staff enough for their dedication to getting this right, for our Constitution and the American people. *Guaranteeing 12 Weeks Of Paid Parental Leave For 2.1 Million Federal Workers* This month, the House and Senate reached an agreement to include part of my Federal Employee Paid Leave Act in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Federal workers will now receive 12 weeks of paid parental leave for the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. This ensures no federal employee must ever decide between being home with their new child or receiving a paycheck. While this is a win for many families, there is still more to be done. We continue to figh for universal paid family and medical leave for both the public and private sector employees across the country. That's why I held my first hearing as chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform on this very issue. Fighting for paid family leave for all Americans has and always will be one of my top legislative priorities. *The First Hearing on The Equal Rights Amendment in Three Decades* [image = *Congresswoman Maloney speaks at the House Committee on the Judiciary hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment* In April, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) held the first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. The ERA was first introduced in 1923 and prohibits denying equal rights on the basis of sex. Congress passed the ERA 47 years ago, but in 1982, the ratification deadline expired without securing approval from the 38 states required to amend the Constitution. Since coming to Congress in 1992, I have introduced legislation to restart the ratification process 12 times, and I was honored to testify at this historic hearing to make the case about why women's rights should be written into the Constitution. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to finally ratify the ERA. *Bearing Witness to Inhumane Conditions at Border Detention Centers* In July, I joined 20 other members of Congress to witness firsthand the horrific conditions at a border detention center in McAllen, Texas. What we saw was unacceptable: extreme overcrowding, no access to showers or toothbrushes, and people forced to sleep on concrete floors. Based on what I have seen and reports I have heard, I believe that the Administration's policies toward immigrants and asylum seekers is traumatizing and dehumanizing. We must treat all human beings with the dignity they deserve and never forget that our nation's diversity is its greatest strength. I am proud to represent a diverse constituency with immigrant communities that make New York City, and America, stronger. *The Economic Cost of Gun Violence: $229B per year* As Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I released a report detailing the economic costs of gun violence and held a hearing with expert witnesses who outlined how to end this epidemic. The report shows that gun violence costs our country $229 billion per year, let alone the immeasurable emotional toll gun violence places on our children, families, and loved ones. Even though New York is the fourth most populous state, it is not in the top ten when it comes to total gun violence costs. I credit our strong gun safety laws, which include an assault weapons ban. In my opinion, the federal government should look to New York as a model for federal gun laws. *Winning at the Supreme Court: Blocking the 2020 Census Citizenship Question* As co-chair of the House Census Caucus, I fought back against the Administration's efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census which census experts agreed would make the Census less accurate. They reported that including the question would lead to an undercount and therefore would undercut federal funding for minority communities and would deprive millions of Americans fair representation in all levels of government. In June, the Supreme Court delivered a victory for fair census advocates by ruling that the citizenship question could not be added to the 2020 Census. I remain laster-focused on ensuring a fair and accurate 2020 Census. *Cracking Down On Anonymous Shell Companies* The House passed my Corporate Transparency Act, which requires companies to disclose their beneficial owners at the time the company is formed. This prevents bad actors from using anonymous shell companies from thwarting law enforcement and hiding illicit activities. We are the only advanced country in the world that doesn't require this disclosure. The illicit use of anonymous shell companies is a pressing national security threat and this legislation is a straightforward solution. Beyond the impacts for law enforcement, this bill will also help to crack down on New York's real estate being used to park illicit money, driving up housing costs and limiting availability. It seems that more than ever before, there are too many dark windows in apartments in NYC at night - but with this bill, it is my hope that this practice will be put to an end. Too many anonymous LLCs instead of families own NYC apartments. The Senate needs to act to pass this bill without delay. Removing NYC Department Of Sanitation Trucks from East 10th Street* [image = *Congresswoman Maloney speaks at an event calling for the removal of sanitation trucks from East 10th Street* In August, I joined a group of local officials in calling on the NYC Department of Sanitation and Mayor de Blasio to immediately remove sanitation trucks that have been a burden on resident and business owners. I am thankful that Mayor de Blasio committed to removing these trucks. I look forward to the City finding a permanent location for NYC Department of Sanitation trucks that does not disrupt New Yorkers lives. *City & State's *2019 Women Power 100* List.* I was so proud to be named to City & State's *2019 Women Power 100* list because of my influential and senior positions on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, the Joint Economic Committee, and the Financial Services Committee. I am honored to be included on this list of so many incredible New York women. I want to thank City and State for including me, and I vow to keep working on behalf of women and our great nation every day. *Ensuring Businesses Can Access Terrorism Risk Insurance* Working with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee, we reauthorized the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in the bipartisan spending package ahead of the bill's 2020 expiration. After September 11th, the market for terrorism insurance completely shut down. Without it, construction stopped and thousands of jobs were lost. TRIA provides a backstop for terrorism insurance to make it both available and affordable at no cost to taxpayers. TRIA can't prevent a terrorist attack, but it can greatly lessen the financial impact. This program works and reauthorizing it ahead of its expiration was the right thing to do. *Allocating $25 Million to Study Gun Violence* For the first time since 1996, Congress has approved federal funding for the study of gun violence. I have been introducing a bill with Senator Ed Markey to do this for years now because gun violence is a public health epidemic, and it should be studied just like any other health crisis. The $25 million included in the 2020 spending package is a critical first step in addressing an epidemic that takes 100 lives per day. *Fighting for Helicopter Safety for NYC* When a pilot's failed emergency landing crashed into the AXA Equitable Center in Midtown Manhattan, we were reminded of the safety threat posed by non-essential helicopters. After what we felt was insufficient action by the Federal Aviation Admiinistration FAA), I joined with Jerrold Nadler (NY-10) and Nydia Velazquez (NY-7) to introduce legislation to prohibit these helicopter flights over New York City. This law aims to improve safety and quality of life for all New Yorkers. *Putting Public Housing Tenants First * I recently introduced the Public Housing Residents Protection Act to ensure that if and when a public housing authority (like NYCHA) decides to lease or sell any of its assets (like land or buildings), that the sale financially benefits the residents of these communities and the agency overall. Public Housing Authorities across the country should be making decisions with the same top priority: putting the residents' best interests above all else, this bill will ensure that. Also this year, I joined with residents of Holmes and Stanley Isaacs Houses, tenant leaders, and community groups as they filed suit to get necessary repairs to their homes without privatization of public housing. I am also a proud cosponsor of The Public Houseing Emergency Response Act and The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act to fund needed repairs, including the elimination of health and safety hazards from public housing developments across the country. *Opening the New Kosciuszko Bridge* [image = *Congresswoman Maloney celebrating the completion of the Kosciuszko Bridge with some of the workers who helped to build it.* On August 28, I was thrilled to celebrate the completion of our new, state of the art, Kosciuszko Bridge and to have helped secure $670 million in federal funds, roughly 85% of its total cost (*picutred right*). I feel that the Kosciuszko Bridge is an example of the great things New York and our nation can accomplish when we fund bold, innovative infrastructure projects. A city has to invest in itself to stay strong, and when I look at the Kosciusko Bridge and all the rest of our projects, I know that New York's future is incredibly bright. *Fighting Antisemitism Through Education* This year, as I have for many years, I introduced legislation to fight antisemitism through education. As a former educator, I know that education is key in fighting all types of bigotry and hate. As we see the rates of violent acts of antisemitism rising in our city, I remain as committed as ever to getting this bill passed to give educators across the country the tools and resources they need to teach about the dangers of antisemitism and hate. This bill has broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate and I hope to get it passed in the new year. *On Our Way to Building a Smithsonian Women's Museum* Last month, the Committee on House Administration unanimously passed my bill, H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act, to create a museum dedicated to telling the comprehensive story of American women throughout our nation's history. Creating this museum isn't just about understanding our past; it's an investment in our future. In celebrating the achievements of women in history, we're educating and inspiring the next generation to make history themselves. I've worked my entire career to make sure women are represented in the halls of Congress and seats of power. I'm proud we're well on our way to the day when women are celebrated for the history they've made and more young women are inspired for the future. I believe it would be very fitting to pass this bill in 2020 as we celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment which guarantees women's right to vote. As always, your concerns still and always will remain my top priority. Please do not hesitate to email me through my website.

In recent weeks, the House of Representatives passed my bipartisan bill to&nbsp;ban insider trading; the Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3), which would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower prices of drugs purchased through Medicare Part D;&nbsp; the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4), which would remove barriers to voting; the TRACED Act (S. 151), which would address the explosion of robocalls; a bill that would improve coastal resiliency in Connecticut; and more.&nbsp; In between these votes, I&#8217;ve been in the Fourth District meeting with constituents, visiting businesses and hosting virtual town halls. As the largest provider of commercial property-assessed clean energy financing in the country, Greenworks Lending plays a major role in constructing energy-efficient buildings and helping companies reduce their environmental footprint. Greenworks works closely with Connecticut&#8217;s Green Bank, which provides financing to a variety of green energy projects, helping leverage billions in private dollars. Earlier this year, I introduced the National Green Bank Act (H.R. 3423), which would capitalize green banks set up by territories, states, counties and municipalities, including Connecticut&#8217;s Green Bank. These local green banks would finance &#8211; in the form of direct support or credit enhancement &#8211; energy efficiency, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, fuel cell, alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure projects, among others.       Rep. Himes visits Greenworks Lending in Darien and discusses clean energy priorities in Congress.    Next, I stopped by Brien McMahon High School to meet with local high school students. It is always energizing to hear from high school students who are passionate about protecting the environment and giving back to local communities. We chatted about my path into public service, the relationships I've built with friends and colleagues across the aisle and how I work in Congress every day to improve the lives of my constituents.&nbsp;        Rep. Himes discusses his role in Congress and recent legislation with Brien McMahon High School students.    On a snowy afternoon, I hosted an online town hall to update you about Congress&#8217; year-end legislative priorities and to answer your questions about my role with the House Intelligence Committee on the recent impeachment inquiry hearings. You can watch the full video on my&nbsp;Facebook page here.&nbsp;  When I am not in Washington, I&#8217;m eager to meet with my constituents, visit our community&#8217;s businesses and attend local events. I want to hear from you about the issues impacting you.

Morgan Griffith","address":"Griffith.News@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-12-14","subject":"No on Impeachment","body":"No on Impeachment After a brief and biased inquiry, House Democrats have put forward two articles of impeachment against President Trump, the first charging him with abuse of power and the second alleging obstruction of Congress. Neither article holds up under scrutiny. Article One The abuse of power President Trump supposedly committed was an attempt to coerce Ukraine into opening an investigation to benefit himself. Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, sat on the Ukrainian natural gas company Burismas board despite his lack of qualifications. You may recall that Joe Biden had previously bragged publicly about arranging for a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating Burisma to be fired. Even if Joe Bidens actions as Vice President had nothing to do with his sons involvement in Burisma, he should have recognized they created an appearance of impropriety and a clear conflict of interest. In a phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, President Trump said, Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it . . . It sounds horrible to me. Note that President Trump did not ask President Zelensky to find the Bidens guilty of anything, but to find the truth of the situation. If the Obama Administration can prevent an investigation by forcing out a prosecutor, the Trump Administration should be able to give the green light to reopen an investigation. I do not think the Presidents request constituted an impeachable offense. In any event, does the simple fact that Joe Biden is a presidential candidate give him or his family immunity from investigations? That would give anyone running for president or their families a get out of jail free card. Further, Democrats claim President Trump tied investigations to military aid to Ukraine, but this aid was not actually halted even though Ukraine has not opened an investigation. President Zelensky has also said he felt no pressure to open the investigation. Congress instructed the President to ensure Ukraine was solving its corruption problems before releasing the money. President Trump had the right to do so. Further, it should be remembered that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, even if not to the extent of the Russians. To verify, one only needs to read the op-ed in The Hill by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States in August 2016. That ambassador was not recalled from Ukraine until July 2019. Clearly, Ukraines corruption issues are still lingering well into 2019. People may not agree with how President Trump has interacted with Ukraine, but they should express their disagreement through the policy process in Congress or the ballot box. No evidence of abuse of power has been produced to justify the penalty of impeachment and removal from office, which no president has suffered in our history. Article Two Nor do the Democrats have grounds to impeach President Trump on obstruction of Congress. As a Member of Congress, I want to maintain our prerogatives. That is what the Framers counted on when they designed the Constitution. They knew that the people in each of the three branches of government would be jealous of their own powers and ready to check the others if they stepped out of their bounds. President Trump and the current Democratic House are engaged in the same contest as George Washington when he claimed executive privilege over documents the House wanted to see. That back and forth has continued. The difference this time is that Democrats in the House want to jump to impeachment over various less severe remedies. When President Obamas administration failed to produce documents we asked for, House Republicans held then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress and went to court to enforce subpoenas. We did not move to impeach President Obama. Democrats have short-circuited the process by racing to impeach. Subpoenas from other investigations are still being sorted out in the courts. In fact, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently temporarily blocked a subpoena of President Trumps financial records. In the impeachment investigation, the Democrats are not waiting to determine if their subpoenas are lawful. I believe their speed is due to political considerations, not constitutional questions. Lowering the threshold on what is impeachable may come back to haunt Democrats. I still believe the standard tug of war between branches should be resolved through the courts, legislation, and other commonplace tools, but if this Congress brings impeachment out of the toolshed for historically predictable disagreements, then a future Congress may be reluctant to return it.

The number of veteran suicides nationwide continues to rise, and approximately 14 of the 20 veterans who die by suicide each day are not receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration. County Veteran Service Officers (CVSOs) are often the first point of contact in the community for veterans and are on the frontlines in this battle against veteran suicides by helping enroll veterans into the VA Health Administration. Senator Baldwin&#8217;s bipartisan Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach (CVSO) Act will increase resources for CVSOs that will better connect more veterans to the services they need.   &#8220;In 2017 alone, more than 6,100 veterans died by suicide, an amount nearly equal to the number of servicemembers killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. The veteran suicide rate has stayed relatively constant for the past 10 years and we need to do something about it,&#8221; said Senator Baldwin. &#8220;County Veteran Service Officers are on the frontlines everyday working to combat this tragic crisis, and this bipartisan legislation will support their efforts to provide needed services and solutions for our veterans that will improve their health and well-being.&#8221; &nbsp;   Veterans are not always aware of the benefits available to them and CVSOs are often the first to inform them of their eligibility. CVSOs are local county employees who are nationally accredited by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help veterans process their VA claims. These employees are responsible for successfully processing more than $22 billion in claims annually for direct compensation and pension benefits for veterans. They also provide assistance to veterans on a range of benefits and services, including compensation benefits, VA home loans, education benefits and available job placement assistance. However, there is currently no federal funding support directly available for CVSOs. Senator Baldwin&#8217;s bipartisan CVSO Act authorizes $50 million annually for five years to expand and support CVSOs or similar local entities, who currently assist veterans in obtaining critical benefits and services. The VA will award competitive grants to CVSOs, through the states, to create, expand, or support programs that promote health and wellness, prevent suicide and reach veterans who need help navigating the often-burdensome VA process. By increasing the number of CVSOs, states will be able to better leverage their local and federal resources to serve our veterans.&nbsp; Supporters of Senator Baldwin&#8217;s legislation, including the National Association of Counties (NACo), the National Association of County Veteran Service Officers (NACVSO), the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, and many individual CVSOs, local officials and stakeholders in Wisconsin agree:   &#8220;Counties provide much-needed services to millions of veterans and their families,&#8221; said National Association of Counties Executive Director Matthew Chase. &#8220;The Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach Act will help us better connect veterans to key health, housing and career readiness resources. We applaud Senators Baldwin and Sullivan&#8217;s bipartisan efforts to support county veterans service officers, and we look forward to working with Congress to better serve veterans in our communities.&#8221; &#8220;NACVSO applauds introduction of the &#8216;Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach Act&#8217; by Senator Tammy Baldwin. This Act will provide Federal support to County, Tribal, and State Veterans Service Officers that have historically been the first point of contact for veterans seeking to utilize their VA benefits and it will ensure that veterans have continued and expanded access to community advocates,&#8221; said Herm Brueur, President of National Association of County Veterans Service Officers (NACVSO).  &#8220;We currently have lost more veterans by suicide than those we have lost in executing the current wars. It is imperative to have advocates in the counties and communities where veterans and their families live to connect them with their earned benefits. This legislation provides resources to market VA benefits, create new CVSO offices to reach those who are struggling, or provide training for current CVSO offices. This will enhance the services for our veterans and ensure they have access to well-trained professional advocates at the local level to connect them to their benefits and improve the quality of their lives. They deserve these services for their service to our great country,&#8221; said Joseph G. Aulik, Director of Veterans Services for the Brown County CVSO in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  &#8220;We support Senator Baldwin's initiative to strengthen our Sheboygan County Veteran Service Office outreach and services to veterans and their families. Sadly, veteran suicides continue to rise, and this funding will bolster our efforts to help people in need and save lives,&#8221; said Adam Payne, Sheboygan County Administrator.

As Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats continue their partisan impeachment sham, they have now introduced&nbsp;Articles of Impeachment. Even though they don't have the evidence and have orchestrated an unfair process, they have put the goals of their far-left wing base ahead of their responsibility to serving the country. On another note, after a year of dragging her feet, Pelosi has agreed to President Trump's United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The House has also considered the Conference Report for the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act in order to fund our national defense and give our men and women in uniform the resources they deserve.  &nbsp;   United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement After the Democrat majority held off a floor vote for months while playing politics, Speaker Pelosi has finally agreed to President Trump's trade deal and will bring the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to the House floor for a vote. As a member of the committee that handles trade &#8211; the House Ways and Means Committee &#8211; it has been an honor to work with Ranking Member Kevin Brady and other Committee members to support the efforts of President Trump and the administration to renegotiate NAFTA. This is clearly a better deal for American businesses and workers.  This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation. By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive. After years of sluggish recovery, our economy is booming again and growing 50 percent faster than projected. America is once again the most competitive place in the world to do business and thanks to the hard work of President Trump, the USMCA will help continue that growth. I was proud to be the conservative voice in the room at the White House to emphasize the trade priorities of my neighbors in the Third District, and again in Ottawa with Ways and Means Committee members to voice the importance of this trade agreement. As Chief Deputy Whip, I will have the honor of working alongside Republican Whip Steve Scalise to deliver a big vote in support of President Trump&#8217;s trade deal.  &nbsp;   Photo of the Week   Meeting with Whip Scalise and the USMCA Whip team to chat about the upcoming vote. &nbsp;   Congressional Spring Internship Interested in spending a semester in Washington, D.C. interning on Capitol Hill?

Senator Rick Scott released the following statement:&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I'm extremely concerned by the reports that this shooter was a foreign national training on a U.S. military base in Florida. Whether this individual was motivated by radical Islam or was simply mentally unstable, this was an act of terrorism. It's clear that we need to take steps to ensure that any and all foreign nationals&nbsp;are scrutinized and vetted extensively before being&nbsp;embedded with our American men and women in uniform.   &#8220;I&#8217;m calling for a full review of the U.S. military programs to train foreign nationals on American soil. There is no reason we should be providing state-of-the-art military training to people who wish us harm. And most importantly, there is no reason to risk the safety and security of our American men and women in uniform. If not for the bravery displayed by the military personnel on the ground and local law enforcement, this tragedy could have been much worse. We must be vigilant against those who wish our country and our people harm.\"&nbsp; &#151;  Also this week, Senator Scott cosponsored:   The Bring Our Heroes Home Act to support the loved ones of&nbsp;Missing Armed Forces Personnel; and&nbsp; The&nbsp;Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers (PAWS) Act&nbsp;to help&nbsp;provide service dogs to veterans with severe post-traumatic stress disorder  See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.              Sen. Rick Scott: The Green New Deal is Best Example of Washington&#8217;s Waste  This week, Senator Rick Scott released&nbsp;an episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money. See previous Washington Waste Wednesday features HERE.&nbsp;  This week's episode covers the Green New Deal, a socialist Democrat proposal that would cost as much as $93 trillion and destroy the nation&#8217;s economy. What socialist Democrats fail to understand is that you don&#8217;t have to choose between caring about the environment or growing the economy &#150; you can do BOTH. Throughout his time as Governor of Florida, Senator Scott made record investments in the environment, which he was able to do because of Florida&#8217;s booming economy.

Rick Scott: UN Cooperation with Communist China is Dangerous  Senator Rick Scott made the below statement following reports that the United Nations&#8217; standards for facial recognition, video monitoring, and city and vehicle surveillance are being shaped by Chinese tech groups.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;By putting Nicolas Maduro on its human rights council, the UN proved that it has no respect for human rights. Now, the UN is highlighting its complete disregard for privacy and national security by allowing Communist China to control facial recognition standards. Communist China, which is now partnering with Russia in its quest for global dominance, is stealing our personal information and intellectual property to use against us. The UN&#8217;s willingness to hand over control of setting privacy standards to Communist China is yet another example of why the United States needs to reconsider our financial support.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: International Olympics Committee&#8217;s Cowardly Failure to Stand up for Human Rights  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after receiving a response from the International Olympic Committee to a letter he sent in October. In the letter, Senator Scott called on the International Olympic Committee to stand for freedom and urge Communist China to stop violating human rights, or find a new home for the 2022 Olympic Games.&nbsp;  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;The response I received from the International Olympic Committee is shameful and embarrassing for an organization that prides itself on &#8216;uniting the world in peaceful competition.&#8217; Are they na&#239;ve enough to think Communist China wants to unite the world? Secretary of the Communist Party Xi is violating human rights and stealing intellectual property and technology from the United States in an effort to dominate the world &#150; the opposite of unity. The Committee claims to be politically neutral, but the fight for human rights transcends politics. It&#8217;s sad they cannot see this.   &#8220;On top of that, the Committee provided no information on how they will prevent Communist China from stealing personal information and data of athletes and leaders from around the world who come to the Olympics. This kind of cowardice is shameful and disappointing, and the world needs to speak out against every organization that refuses to defend freedom and human rights.&#8221; Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen.

I know the next 150 years will bring the area even more success. *Remembering the life of Bishop William Graves* This week, we celebrate the life of Memphis' own, Bishop William Graves [link 1]. I believe he was one of our nation's most consequential religious and civic leaders. With his quiet, strong leadership, he made our lives better and made us proud to claim him as a native son. Over the years, Bishop Graves became a treasured friend of my family. We will miss him and offer his family our great respect for his life of service. *Simplifying the FAFSA for 20 million families and permanently funding Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority serving institutions* This week, I released and the Senate passed a bipartisan solution [link 2] that will make permanent $255 million in annual funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions and simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 20 million American families. It's hard to think of a piece of legislation that will have more of a lasting impact on minority students and their families than this bill. First, it provides permanent funding for HBCUs and other minority serving institutions attended by over 2 million minority students. Second, it takes a big first step in simplifying the FAFSA by eliminating the bureaucratic nightmare created by requiring students to give the federal government the same information twice. Students give permission to the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education to share tax return data, which eliminates up to 22 questions on the FAFSA with one click. I look forward to working with the House of Representatives to put it on President Trump's desk to be signed into law. *President Trump approved Governor Lee's Disaster relief request for the state of Tennessee* I sent a letter this week with Senator Marsha Blackburn and Representative Mark Green to President Trump urging him to support Governor Bill Lee's request for a major disaster declaration. This request will provide public assistance for 10 Tennessee counties in order to respond to the overwhelming damage caused by severe storms and straight-line winds in October. I commend President Trump for quickly approving Governor Bill Lee's request [link 3]. This federal assistance will help Tennessee communities begin to rebuild and recover. Full text of the letter is available here [link 4]. *Dr. Stephen Hahn is well-prepared to lead the FDA at this critical time* [image = The Senate health committee I chair this week approved the nomination of Dr. Stephen Hahn [link 5] to serve as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by a bipartisan vote of 18-5. Dr. Hahn has extensive medical and research experience and is a proven leader in large health systems -- all around, he is exactly the type of nominee we want to lead an agency as important as the FDA. Now it's time for him to be confirmed because there is a lot the FDA needs to do -- approve new life-saving drugs and devices, regulate tobacco and e-cigarettes, address the opioid crisis and ensure pain patients can receive the medications they need, and protect our nation's food supply. Dr. Hahn is well prepared to lead the FDA at this critical time. His nomination will be voted on next week by the full Senate. [image = *I met with Gerald Parish, Director of Recreation Education Services for the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. He even brought his granddaughter to see Washington, D.C. for the first time.* *Senate confirms Dan Brouillette to serve as U.S. Secretary of Energy* This week, the U.S. Senate confirmed Dan Brouillette [link 6] to serve as U.S. Secretary of Energy by a vote of 70-15. I voted last month in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to advance Mr. Brouillette's nomination so it could be considered by the full Senate. I supported Mr. Brouillette's nomination to serve as deputy secretary in 2017, and I was happy to vote for him again to lead the energy department. Mr. Brouillette has visited Oak Ridge National Laboratory and understands the critical importance of the work being done in Oak Ridge. I'm confident he will continue to build on the progress former Secretary Rick Perry made by supporting energy research, our 17 national laboratories and supercomputing, which helps give America a competitive edge in creating jobs. *Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia set an example for U.S. senators* I spoke on the Senate floor this week in a farewell speech to Sen. Johnny Isakson [link 7] of Georgia, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of the year. I like to encourage my constituents in Tennessee to look at Washington, D.C., as if it were a split screen television. On the one side, you see what most people are watching -- you see impeachment, tweets and Supreme Court controversies. But on the other side, where very few probably watch, you see senators like Johnny Isakson working to pass an opioid bill or senators working to pay songwriters a fair amount for their work. That is where Johnny Isakson has spent most of his 15 years. Johnny learned a long time ago that if all you want to do is take a position or make a speech, then you don't need to go through all the trouble of joining the United States Senate -- you can get a radio program. He has reminded us of why we're here. He reminded us that, if you are a United States senator, it's hard to get here, it's hard to stay here, and while you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something good for the country. He set an example for why we senators are here. That is Johnny Isakson's legacy and that is something we should be grateful for. You can watch my floor remarks here [link 8]. *The best-kept secret in Washington is record funding for our national laboratories, supercomputing and biomedical research* On Friday, I met with members of the East Tennessee Economic Council (ETEC) and told them that the best-kept secret in Washington is record funding for our national laboratories, supercomputing and biomedical research. In fact, Congress sent $4.6 billion to Oak Ridge last year, and the Senate is on track to increase funding for national laboratories by 42 percent, supercomputers by 64 percent and biomedical research by 40 percent over the last 5 years. Americans invented the Internet. And the personal computer. We invented nuclear power. And the polio vaccine. Government sponsored research has helped make America the greatest country in the world. And much of that is happening right here in the Oak Ridge Corridor. The Knoxville airport now has a new sign that says: \"Welcome to Knoxville: Gateway to the Smokies and The Oak Ridge Corridor.\" And it's about time we celebrate it. I have come to think of the Oak Ridge Corridor not as something that requires renaming a highway, but as a concept -- a regional brand that can include Maryville and Morristown, Kingston and Sevierville, and any other East Tennessee community that wants to claim it.

Closer to home, Senator Romney also continued advocating for the need to tackle the youth vaping epidemic, introduced legislation to combat the circulation of opioids through the mail, and met with several groups of Utahns. Keep scrolling for a brief recap of the Senator's week:           Senator Romney and Senator Murphy (D-CT), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee covering the Middle East, convened a hearing on U.S. policy in Iraq and Lebanon. The hearing focused on the ongoing protests in the region and their implications for U.S. security interests, as well as the recent hold on U.S. military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces. Senator Romney's opening remarks can be viewed below:   The&nbsp;recent protests in Lebanon and Iraq - civilians decrying high unemployment, Iranian intervention, and corruption - have major implications for U.S. national security in the region. The U.S. needs an effective strategy on how to best partner with these nations to advance mutual interests.   Full story by Dennis Romboy here.   China has a comprehensive, rigorous strategy to achieve global domination. At a forum this week, Senator Romney warned of China&#8217;s growing economic aggression, human rights abuses, and military strength - and the need to forge international partnerships to counter these challenges. &#8220;[A]s the leader of the free world, we should lead the development with our allies of a comprehensive strategy designed to convince China that it is in its best interest to change its ambition from dominating the world to instead collaborating and competing in the world,&#8221; he said. The Senator's remarks can be found here.     Senator Romney voted to advance the nomination of Dr. Stephen Hahn to serve as FDA Commissioner out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for full consideration by the full Senate. He did so with reservations, saying:&nbsp;&#8220;Dr. Hahn committed under oath that if he was confirmed, he would use science and data to guide his decisions on the youth vaping crisis. I am counting on him to follow through on that commitment, and I will insist that if confirmed, he will keep this committee and the nation informed about how his decisions are being made. We have a massive public health emergency, with five million kids in high school who are vaping and becoming addicted to nicotine, and we must place the interest of public health above political interest.\"    The Senator also expressed alarm at new data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) revealing that more than 27 percent of high schoolers and 10.5 percent of middle schoolers reported having vaped within the last month:&nbsp;&#8220;The latest data released today by the CDC shows that the vaping crisis is worsening, with more than one quarter of high schoolers and 10.5 percent of middle schoolers reporting they have vaped in the past 30 days. To reverse this deadly trend, the Administration and Congress must act without any more delay to ban flavors that appeal to kids and prevent vaping cartridges from being adulterated with substances that kill. A continued failure to act in the face of this data would be unconscionable.&#8221;    As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Romney joined Sen. Peters (D-MI) on legislation to combat the circulation of opioids, including fentanyl, through the mail saying.&nbsp;The U.S. Postal Service Opioid &amp; Illicit Drug Strategy Act would require the U.S. Postal Service to develop and publish a comprehensive organizational strategy to combat the use of the mail in illicit drug distribution, allowing the agency to identify areas for improvement, enhance coordination across departments, and proactively meet emerging challenges.   Full story by Dennis Romboy and Pat Reavy here.   During a Senate Foreign Relations hearing focused on U.S. policy toward Russia, Senator Mitt Romney&nbsp;stressed&nbsp;the need for the U.S. to develop a comprehensive strategy, instead of just ad hoc sanctions, that diverts Russia from its current path.&nbsp;     In continuation of his&nbsp;efforts to find a solution that compensates student athletes while preserving the integrity of college sports, Senator Romney teamed up with Senators Murphy (D-CT), Rubio (R-FL), Perdue (R-GA), and Booker (D-NJ) to form a bipartisan working group that facilitates these ongoing discussions and evaluate potential solutions.   Full story by Matthew Brooks here.   If we don't act now to address the solvency of programs like Medicare and Social Security, our government's trust funds will be depleted in 13 years.

Full op-ed by Maya MacGuineas here.   This week, the Senate confirmed David B. Barlow of South Jordan to serve as&nbsp;United States District Judge for the District of Utah. Senators Romney and Lee (R-UT) released the following statement upon his confirmation:&nbsp;&#8220;We have full confidence David will serve Utah and the country with honor and integrity, faithfully applying the law and our Constitution to all matters and parties that come before him. We wish him well as he begins this next chapter of service to our nation as a U.S. District Judge for the District of Utah.&#8221;&nbsp;      Senator Romney met with several groups of Utahns this week, including:   Students from Springville, Green Canyon, Mountain Crest, Ridgeline, and Logan high schools who were in Washington as part of the Close Up program.   Clint Betts, Executive Director of Silicon Slopes, to discuss Utah's technology industry.   Troy Williams, Executive Director of Equality Utah, to discuss the organization's work at the state and federal level advocating on behalf of the LGBT community.       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Unsubscribe         ","title":"Senator, 1st Class","gender":"M","state":"UT","party":"Republican","score":3.3797019},{"name":"Ann McLane Kuster ","address":"NH02AMIMA@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-12-06","subject":"At work for you","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }     p { margin-bottom:1em; }     News from Representative Kuster                         &nbsp; ABOUT  SERVICES  LEGISLATION  &nbsp;             December 6, 2019    Connect with us                   Dear Lindsey,  Remembering Our Troops During the Holidays  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Laura Landerman-Garber  For 16 years, Laura Landerman-Garber of Hollis has been collecting holiday letters and cards from children all over the country and sending them to American troops serving abroad. It&#8217;s always wonderful to meet with Laura, sign cards, and talk about her commitment to making the holidays brighter for our service men and women. Laura, keep up the great work &#8211; you make New Hampshire proud! Combating Illegal Robocalls  All Americans know what it&#8217;s like to receive countless robocalls &#8211; often multiple times a day. I was glad to vote in favor of bipartisan legislation &#8211; the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act &#8211; this week to help put the American consumer back in control and reduce the frequency of these incessant, disruptive calls. I&#8217;m pleased the House and Senate came together in a bipartisan way to pass this commonsense and much-needed bill, and I urge the President to swiftly sign it into law. Standing Up for Critical Nutrition Assistance   The Trump Administration&#8217;s announcement that it will end nutrition assistance for approximately 700,000 Americans demonstrates a clear lack of care and concern for people who are struggling to put food on the table. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress rejected these cuts to the SNAP program last year. The Administration&#8217;s rule recklessly casts people from the program without considering what economic, geographic, health, and other factors may contribute to their needing food assistance. I hope that the President will re-think this unnecessary and cruel decision. Getting PFAS Chemicals Out of Cosmetics   It was great to join my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues on Wednesday to hear from administration officials, cosmetic industry professionals, and environmental experts to explore how we can empower the Food and Drug Administration to ensure all cosmetic and personal care products are safe.   Despite our progress in New Hampshire to get PFAS chemicals out of our backyards, PFAS is present in many cosmetic and personal care products. From makeup to shampoo, Americans deserve products free from these harmful chemicals. I look forward to the work ahead to protect communities in the Granite State and across the nation from PFAS.       Speaking out against PFAS chemicals in cosmetics. Watch here.    Ensuring New Hampshire Workers are Treated Fairly  While it&#8217;s encouraging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has heeded my request to return to the bargaining table and have a fair and open discussion with American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union representatives, the EPA should have come to this decision sooner. These union representatives are following in the footsteps of previous generations of union members who fought tirelessly for basic fairness and justice on the job, and they deserve a fair negotiation process.  I&#8217;ll be monitoring this situation in the hopes that an acceptable contract will be agreed upon in a timely manner. I will continue to stand up for the hard-working men and women in New Hampshire and I&#8217;ll keep working to ensure that workers nationwide are treated fairly and with respect. Building a Clean Economy   The Granite State is home to some of our nation&#8217;s most pristine, breathtaking lands, and we must act to protect them for future generations. I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing the 100% Clean Economy Act &#8211; a critical step to combat climate change, improve public health, and strengthen our economy with green jobs. The time to act on climate is now. I look forward to my continued work to protect all that makes New Hampshire such a special place to call home.  A Somber but Necessary Step   This week, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House will begin to draft articles of impeachment. I believe this is a somber but necessary moment for our democracy and to protect our national security. We are taking this one step at a time, and when the House Judiciary Committee advances articles of impeachment, I will evaluate each on its individual merits and content.  The House Intelligence Committee&#8217;s report on the impeachment inquiry uncovered substantial and uncontested evidence that President Trump abused the power of the presidency to solicit foreign interference in our election for his own political gain. Every American should have an opportunity to assess the facts and draw conclusions from the evidence. I encourage you to examine the evidence and reach out to my office with your thoughts.  Giving Back to the Community        At the Friendly Kitchen    It was wonderful to join my husband Brad, members of my staff and local volunteers to serve lunch at The Friendly Kitchen in Concord on Monday- thank you Chef Carl and Val for hosting us! Giving back to others is what the holiday season is all about.   Honoring Bill Luti &#8211; a Granite State Role Model   Like so many Granite Staters, I am looking back fondly on the life of Bill Luti, who passed away last week at the age of 98. Bill coached cross country and track for decades at Concord High School and inspired countless young people to challenge themselves and live up to their potential. He was also a role model for young women, having started Concord High&#8217;s girls&#8217; track and field program in the 1970s, when girls&#8217; participation in sports was not taken as seriously as it is today. My thoughts are with Bill&#8217;s family and friends at this time &#8211; his kind and generous spirit will be long remembered.   Here for You&nbsp;  I encourage you to continue reaching out to me with any questions, concerns or ideas you have &#8211; I love hearing from Granite Staters! You can contact my Concord office at 603-226-1002 or my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206. Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our great state &#8211; I hope you enjoy your weekend!

Military Family Month  During Military Family Month in November, I highlighted the families of two local military heroes at Dyess Air Force Base.&nbsp;At the change of command ceremony earlier this year, outgoing Base Commander Col. Brandon Parker had a surprise for his family. As a reward for always being strong and rolling with the punches that come with being a military family that moves every few years to new places, he announced that he's taking them to Disney World - a well deserved treat!    Filling his shoes, Dyess&#8217; new Base Commander Col. Ed Sumangil is excited to be back in Abilene, where he was married and two of his children were born.    Every month, we're grateful for the spouses, children, and loved ones who serve alongside our troops.  Passing USMCA, Delivering A Win For America  The new and much-improved North American trade deal, USMCA, is being held up by House Democrat leadership who are more concerned with playing political games than adding over 176,000 new jobs and $70 billion to our nation's economy. Despite the assurances they have been provided to address concerns about enforcing labor and environmental standards, Democrats are continuing to move the goal posts and put partisan politics over prosperity as they delay passage of USMCA to focus on their impeachment inquisition of President Trump.

That's why I introduced the Accountable Care In Rural America Act before the Thanksgiving holiday to change the incentives of our health care system to reward quality over quantity while reducing the cost to taxpayers over time. I am confident that this bill will empower rural health care providers, reduce costs to both patients and taxpayers, and strengthen the health and well-being of our families living in America's breadbasket and energy basis.

While we fight the impacts of the climate crisis, we should also be looking forward to find ways to protect our environment and lay the foundation for a sustainable future. This week I was hard at work doing just that. I, along with other Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, introduced a package of tax incentives for green energy technologies like wind, solar, energy storage, and electric vehicles and provide new incentives for additional activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I consistently fought for this package on the committee, advocating for it with Chairman Neal, and he finally delivered. This is just one step needed to tackle the climate emergency and put us on the path towards decarbonization. Another step I've been working towards is setting meaningful goals to that the United States must achieve as part of our climate action strategy. This week I several of my colleagues and I unveiled our legislation that to set a nationwide goal of achieving a 100 percent clean economy by 2050, centering on equity and bringing us to \"net-zero\" climate pollution across all sectors of the economy. Over 150 of my colleagues in Congress agree that this is a priority and the cost of climate inaction is already being seen across the country. Over the summer, I worked with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to declare the climate crisis an emergency. As a nation, we must mobilize federal resources to respond to this crisis with the urgency and action it demands. Millions across the country are already suffering the impacts of climate change and many are powerless to stop it. We have the ideas, tools, and vision  now we need action.

We will continue to thank our heroes and&nbsp;their families and remember those who gave their last full measure of devotion in defense of our freedom.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Attending the Leehan Memorial Bridge dedication in Moore on Veterans Day was one of the highlights of this season for Cindy and me. The bridge was dedicated in the memory of Lt. Damon Leehan, who gave his life fighting for our freedom while serving in Afghanistan in 2011.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I sat down with a great group of concerned citizens known as the Mustang Positive Posse thismonth to talk through some of the issues facing our nation.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Peppers Ranch of Guthrie recently received the Angels in Adoption award in Washington, DC. Congratulations to this haven for families who love and care for foster children in a beautiful environment.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I stopped by the Mustang Police Department to thank them for their work to protect all of us and to hear some of the issues facing law enforcement in our communities.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I continue to connect with Oklahoma classrooms, even when the Senate is in session, to answer questions and hear from students across our state. These students from Minco High School asked great questions and were very engaged.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Oklahoma Farm Bureau asked me to preach for their Sunday morning vespers to conclude their state meeting on November 10. It was a beautiful breakfast and a pleasure to see so manyfriends from around the state.    Dear Oklahoma friends and neighbors:  Happy Thanksgiving! Next week, most Oklahomans will get to enjoy at least a day of food and family traditions. As you sit down with your family and/or friends to enjoy this time of gratitude for the freedoms we have as Americans and for God&#8217;s many blessings, remember those serving our nation away from their families in law enforcement and the military. Please also consider giving to or volunteering to help others in need during this season.  Lately, several people have told me that they dread the inevitable Thanksgiving political argument around the table and in the kitchen. Just about every family has some political differences, but we should not allow our political differences to separate our families and friendships.&nbsp;  Let&#8217;s try something for Thanksgiving: turn off the news and turn on the gratitude.&nbsp;  There are so many good things to talk about in our state and nation. Find a family project to do, serve a neighbor in need, get outside, watch the parade, share old stories&#151;anything but bringing up more politics. Make the commitment to change the subject to something or someone you are grateful for every time someone brings up politics. Even though we have so many tough issues right now as a nation, maybe it would be helpful for all of us to take a break from the political noise and remember how much we have to be thankful for. A little more caring and a little less complaining sounds like a good recipe for Thanksgiving.  Government Funding through December  One of those ongoing, tough national conversations right now is the funding for our government. This week, Congress voted to once again delay the deadline until December 20 to fully fund the government through the passage of yet another continuing resolution (CR), a bill that extends funding at current levels. I supported the measure because, with the House&#8217;s preoccupation with the impeachment inquiry, Congress needs more time to consider and pass appropriations bills and consider government shutdown prevention legislation.  However, every CR has consequences. When our government has temporary funding, federal workers worry about a government shutdown, contracts cannot be completed, agency leaders spend all their time on short-term budgets, and costs go up for everyone. The government is open, but it is not working well. That is why I have worked for months to end government shutdowns and make sure short-term funding is really short term.  My bipartisan Prevent Government Shutdowns Act has already passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), and we are currently working to bring the bill to the finish line during the current federal spending conversation. Oklahoma is home to 45,868 federal employees. It&#8217;s time Congress, not the American people, were held responsible for our lack of action. We can continue to solve our debt and deficit issues and take government shutdowns off the table by forcing Members of Congress to stay in Washington until the work is done on federal spending.  CLICK HERE to watch my floor speech this week on our bill and on the current funding conversation in Washington.  UPDATE: Impeachment  Article 1, Section 2 of the US Constitution states, &#8220;The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.&#8221; Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution states, &#8220;The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.&#8221;  Just like the rest of the country, I am tracking the House impeachment hearings and testimony. But the Senate is not involved in the process unless the House chooses to impeach the President. If the House chooses to impeach the President, it will force a trial in the Senate. Until that time, I have plenty of work that needs to get finished. I sat down with one of the former Senate parliamentarians to talk about the Senate rules for impeachment on my latest podcast, the Breakdown with James Lankford. This is a deep dive into the quirky Senate impeachment rules and what you could expect if the House chooses to impeach President Trump.  CLICK HERE to listen to my fascinating conversation with former Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin about the impeachment and trial processes.  UPDATE: Border Security  Last week, I questioned officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Justice Department at a HSGAC hearing to obtain updates on immigration, learn more about the issues with state E-Verify participation, assess government immigration attorney shortages, and hear about ongoing border security issues including detention facility bed shortages.  Last July, I visited border security and immigration facilities along our southern border to see first-hand the overcrowding issues and apprehension processes for illegal crossings along our southern border. In addition to having an opportunity to thank our border law enforcement agencies and personnel directly, my Q&amp;A focused on how we must be ready for a potential surge at our borders this coming spring and summer.  CLICK HERE to watch my Q&amp;A.  Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s Visit to the White House  Last week, I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the visit of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to the White House. Numerous times over the last couple of years, I have publicly expressed my disappointment in the Turkish regime&#8217;s increasing relationship with Russia, particularly its acquisition of the S-400 missile system from Russia, which is designed to take down the American F-35 aircraft. In October, I was outspoken in my support of President Trump&#8217;s announcement to issue sanctions on Turkey amid the aggression in the region, and I was pleased our government prevented Turkey from acquiring America&#8217;s modern F-35 jet.  CLICK HERE to watch my speech on our relationship with Turkey.  UPDATE: Election Security  Earlier this month, I questioned Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher&nbsp;Wray, Under Secretary for DHS Office of Intelligence&nbsp;and Analysis David J. Glawe, and Acting Director of National Counter Terrorism Center&nbsp;(NCTC) Russell Travers, during a HSGAC hearing on&nbsp;&#8220;Threats to the Homeland.&#8221; This annual hearing addresses some of the most pressing&nbsp;issues facing the nation&#8217;s national security and how FBI, NCTC, and DHS work together&nbsp;to thwart potential threats. I focused my Q&amp;A on DHS&#8217; responsibility to address election&nbsp;security.  CLICK HERE to watch my Q&amp;A on election security.  As I have said many times before, we need federal legislation to ensure each state can confidently and securely run their elections. Our states have already put in place most of the recommendations from my Secure Elections Act, so we are definitely in a better position for election security now than we were in 2016. But there is still more work to be done.  In addition to overall election security efforts, I recently worked with Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Gary Peters of Michigan, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin to introduce a bipartisan bill to strengthen local government cyber security defenses by switching to the .gov domain for websites and email addresses. The DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2019 directs DHS to provide resources and assistance to local governments wanting to adopt .gov web addresses.  The internet has become a main source of information, but you certainly can&#8217;t always trust what you read or see. Our bill expands the federal government&#8217;s ability to offer a city, state, county, or Tribal government the .gov domain, which will provide more communities access to safe, secure, online resources. Federal and state government agencies commonly use the .gov domain, but it is not widely used on a local level. This trusted domain increases resilience to cyber crimes that frequently target local government systems.  CLICK HERE to learn more about my bipartisan election cyber security bill.  Federal Fumbles is Coming!  In just over a week, our team will release our annual Federal Fumbles,&nbsp;our guide and solutions to federal inefficiency and government waste. We want to do more than complain about the waste; we want to put a spotlight on it and then fix it.            Keeping You in the Loop   On November 6, I met with Assistant Secretary for Army-Civil Works R.D. James to discuss civic projects and work at the US Army Corps of Engineers, with particular attention to the recent flooding in Green Country. In our meeting I had the opportunity to talk through flood control options and stress the importance of finding a solution to the chronic flooding issues in northeast Oklahoma. We also discussed land-lease issues in eastern Oklahoma and ways to improve all of the Corps processes for local communities and individuals. On November 4, Oklahoma City commemorated 168 days until the 25th anniversary of the tragic loss of 168 lives in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. As we move closer to the 25th anniversary, we should remember well what hatred can do to a community and continue to remember those we lost, those who survived, and those whose lives were changed forever. Let&#8217;s embody the Oklahoma Standard in our everyday lives. Please visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial website to get involved and to learn about our beautiful memorial and museum in OKC. If it has been a few years or if you have never been to the Memorial Museum, I would encourage you and your family to spend a day there to learn about that horrible day so that we #neverforget. On November 4, I led Members of Congress in an amicus brief to urge the US Supreme Court not to enforce a rule issued by Health and Human Services (HHS) during the Obama Administration that forces organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor to violate their religious beliefs.&nbsp;The Supreme Court has sided with the Little Sisters of the Poor twice. It&#8217;s time for the government to stop bullying the people who are actually doing good work for our nation and allow the Sisters to return to their vocation. CLICK HERE to read more about the case and my amicus brief. During the week of Veterans Day, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce the Protect Veterans&#8217; Education and Training Spending (Protect VETS) Act of 2019, which would protect military and veteran students by closing the 90/10 loophole and require for-profit schools to secure at least 10 percent of their revenues from sources other than taxpayers. More than two decades ago, President George H.W. Bush signed a bipartisan bill into law that limited how much federal funding for-profit schools may receive from taxpayers. Now called the 90/10 rule, this limit requires for-profit schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenues from non-federal sources. However, a loophole in the law excludes veteran and active duty education funds like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Tuition Assistance (TA) from being considered as federal funds. Some for-profit schools have exploited this loophole by using aggressive recruitment practices and deceptive marketing to enroll service members, veterans, and other GI Bill beneficiaries. The Protect VETS Act would close the 90/10 loophole by counting VA and DOD funds as federal dollars. This helps protect Vets from some for-profit schools that are taking advantage of them and it protects the taxpayer by forcing for-profit schools to find other sources of funds besides hard working tax payers. CLICK HERE for more information on this commonsense measure to fix the loophole. Last month, Senator Jacky Rosen from Nevada and I launched the Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism. The mission of the Task Force will be to collaborate with law enforcement, federal agencies, state and local government, educators, advocates, clergy, and other stakeholders to combat anti-Semitism by educating and empowering our communities. Watch for more information on our work to combat Anti- Semitism together. CLICK HERE to read our op-ed about the Anti-Semitism Task Force. On November 13, Attorney General William Barr announced a new plan to combat gun violence in our nation known as Project Guardian. The plan enforces existing laws by setting federal law enforcement protocols for information sharing with state law enforcement to ensure individuals who legally are prohibited from owning, possessing, or purchasing a firearm are barred from doing so. I have cosponsored a bill called the NICS Denial Notification Act, which would require federal law enforcement to notify state law enforcement when an individual fails a NICS background check. Project Guardian would enforce similar guidelines as well as greater enforcement of gun revocations from convicted domestic violence offenders and better information sharing among state and federal law enforcement regarding mental health-related denials of firearms. I have also cosponsored the RESPONSE Act, which provides increased resources for law enforcement and mental health training, as well as school safety to address active shooter training. I remain a staunch Second Amendment advocate and believe enforcement of existing law, like Project Guardian, or clarifying legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and improve training for law enforcement are helpful as we confront gun violence in our nation. CLICK HERE to read the AG&#8217;s full memorandum on Project Guardian. Between the State of Oklahoma and our partners in federal agencies, we continue to work toward an overall reduction of opioid-related deaths by treating drug addiction and dependence and focus on the mental health aspects of both. After the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy visited eastern and central Oklahoma earlier this year, the Director shared data that shows Oklahoma has already seen a 1.4 percent overall decrease in overdose deaths - down but not by very much. All of us should help people we know who struggle with addiction of any type. I have met multiple times with the National Institutes of Health to encourage them to keep up their work to discover non-addictive pain treatment alternatives. CLICK HERE to watch the video. The Senate continues to work through Judicial and Executive Branch nominations, including several for courts and legal positions affecting Oklahoma. This week, the nomination of Judge Bernard M. Jones to serve as judge on the US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and now heads to the Senate floor. The Judiciary Committee also approved the nomination of Mrs. Jodi Dishman, a nominee to serve as a district court judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. Senator Inhofe and I were also both pleased to see President Trump&#8217;s nomination of John Heil to serve as judge on the US District Court for the Eastern, Northern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma. We will continue to work through these and other nominations through the advice and consent process in the Senate. CLICK HERE to read more about Bernard Jones. CLICK HERE to read more about Jodi Dishman I was recently joined by a bipartisan group of senators, including Senator Inhofe, to introduce the Harmless Error Lesser Penalty (HELP) for Small Businesses Act (S. 2757). This simple good government bill would waive fines for first-time paperwork violations by small businesses, excluding fines for violations that endanger the public health or safety, criminal activity, IRS enforcement, and issues that could cause harm to the public interest. Small businesses have difficulty wading through the vast quagmire of federal paperwork, so let&#8217;s give a little grace, instead of giving a fine for one small harmless paperwork error. CLICK HERE to learn more about the bill. Households will soon be able to respond to the 2020 Census online, over the phone, or through a paper questionnaire. Additionally, if you are interested in being a census-taker, the Census Bureau is working hard to recruit and hire local census takers from local communities. You can find more information on how to participate in the 2020 Census HERE. It is important for every Oklahoman to complete their Census form. I recently stopped by several Oklahoma City-based TV stations to talk through the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the impeachment inquiry in the House, our work on the Finance Committee to combat rising prescription drug prices, and other issues.

The Soviet Union crumbled. Greece&#8217;s economy collapsed. Cuba and Venezuela today are failed states, and people are suffering. Why would America want to emulate any of these failed socialist regimes? &nbsp;  ***  &nbsp;  The American dream exists because of the free-market system. The socialist agenda would kill the American dream. &nbsp;  Why? Because state control shuts down creative thought and individual choice.  &nbsp;  The free-market system in America relies on innovation, capital formation, and the rule of law. Socialism thwarts innovation and hijacks the flow of capital. &nbsp;  Free markets breed entrepreneurship and foster risk-taking. Socialist regimes crush job creators and eliminate economic growth.  &nbsp; Capitalism creates individual opportunity. Socialism undercuts individual liberties and allows the state to dictate what is best for the individual. This type of government control is precisely what our Founding Mothers and Founding Fathers fled.  &nbsp;  Individual freedom, by definition, must be sacrificed to implement the Democrats&#8217; socialist agenda.  &nbsp;  ***  &nbsp;  Today, we are in an ideological war for the future of our republic. If Democrats win the White House, take the Senate majority, and keep the House, they will create a socialist regime to change the very fabric of America.  &nbsp;  The choice in 2020 is not about personality. It is about what kind of nation we will leave for our children and our children&#8217;s children.  &nbsp;  It is about America&#8217;s national interest versus political self-interest. It is about self-determination versus total state control. It is about preserving America&#8217;s founding principles.  &nbsp;  Always remember: The price of socialism is freedom.  &nbsp;  READ THE FULL OP-ED HERE.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                        &nbsp;  ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"M","state":"GA","party":"Republican","score":4.5477085},{"name":"Congressman Drew Ferguson","address":"GA03.Outreach@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-11-20","subject":"This Week in Congress","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }     p { margin-bottom:1em; }       News from Representative Ferguson  Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window &nbsp; &nbsp; Click here to open a plain text version of this email                             &nbsp;   CONTACT  MEDIA  &nbsp;              Dear Friend,&nbsp;  This week, the House passed H.R. 5084 a Continuing Resolution (CR) that extends current levels of government funding through December 20, 2019.&nbsp;While the Continuing Resolution avoids a government shutdown temporarily, it continues to provide a cloud of uncertainty for our military.&nbsp;Having to utilize a CR to keep the government open is a result of the failure of House Democrats to focus on the real issues. Instead of working to pass appropriations bills on time, they continue to be singularly focused on undoing the results of the 2016 election.  Further, Speaker Pelosi is still slow-walking the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) and refusing to bring the deal to the floor for a vote despite having overwhelming bipartisan support. Prescription drug pricing legislation has stalled and little is being done in Washington - other than a partisan impeachment inquiry. It is long past time for the Democrats to get back to the business of the American people.  &nbsp;   Telephone Town-hall Poll Results Thank you to everyone who participated in my recent telephone town-hall.

If you didn't get a chance to ask a question, please click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to leave a comment on my website.&nbsp;  During our call, I asked participants: \"After millions of dollars, years of investigations, the Mueller Report, and now the Pelosi/ Schiff impeachment inquiry - and while legislative business like funding the government, prescription drug prices, trade agreements with Canada &amp; Mexico, Japan &amp; China, and much more remains unfinished - do you support the Democrats use of time in Washington?\" In response to this survey, 86% said they do not support the Democrats use of time, while 14%&nbsp;of Third District respondents answered that they did. I also asked: \"Do you support the United States Mexico Canada Agreement?\" In response to this survey, 91% of Third District respondents answered they do support the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, while 9% answered that they did not.

I&nbsp; had the great honor of presenting a late veteran's family with a Purple Heart for his sacrifice to our country. Our brave and dedicated service members and their families make significant sacrifices to protect our freedoms, and I am forever grateful to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Participating in Impeachment Questioning     As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I participated in the impeachment hearings that took place this week. On Wednesday, I questioned Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. On Friday, I questioned Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are clear, confirmed by our witness, Ambassador Yovanovitch: defensive lethal aid was provided to Ukraine not by the Obama Administration, but by the Trump Administration.&nbsp;Obama&#8217;s own State Dept. was so concerned about conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden&#8217;s role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping the Ambassador for her confirmation. Yet our Democratic colleagues and Adam Schiff cry foul when we dare ask that same question.&nbsp;I was very disappointed that Chairman Adam Schiff continued limiting questions from Republican Members of the Intelligence Committee, and I will continue to speak out to ensure full transparency for the American people.  Watch my full questioning from day one here, and day two here. Writing an Op-Ed on Serving North Country Veterans  In case you missed it, this week I wrote an op-ed to the Sun on ensuring North Country seniors have access to quality and affordable care. Here is an excerpt below: Veterans Day is a time to recognize and thank those who dedicate their lives to serving our great nation and protecting our unique freedoms. The North Country is home to more veterans than any other district in New York state; one of my main priorities in Congress is to work tirelessly to improve their lives and ensure they receive the best possible care, benefits, and recognition for their service. Fort Drum, home of the 10th Mountain Division, is an important part of our district as it remains critical to preserving a strong national security and contributes to the economic well-being of the community. I have been a proud and outspoken advocate for all of our veterans. It is essential that veterans have access to affordable, quality healthcare and benefits. So far this Congress, I had the opportunity to work to advance several important bills that honor and protect veterans. I helped lead the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, which restored benefits to veterans who served in the territorial seas of Vietnam and were exposed to Agent Orange, and was signed into law in June of this year. Read the full Op-Ed here.&nbsp;  Appearing on Fox News with Martha MacCallum    I was glad to appear on Fox News with Martha MacCallum to discuss this week's impeachment hearings and Adam Schiff's broken, partisan impeachment process. I will continue to be a leading voice by asking relevant questions and demanding transparency throughout the process. You can watch my full interview here and above.&nbsp;  Announcing USDA Rural Community Facilities Funding for Clayton  This week, I announced a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan totaling $2,734,000 to be awarded to Cerow Arena, an existing community center in the town of Clayton. The funding will be used to fund a 12,500 square foot addition and improve building accessibility, office space, and provide upgrades for the facility to maintain its Red Cross Shelter Certification. I am excited that the town of Clayton will be receiving this critical funding to revitalize their important community center. This loan will allow the center to remain an important part of the Clayton community for many years to come. I am a strong advocate for the rural development of our North Country communities through projects like these, and look forward to continuing my work to ensure our region has access to resources to further enhance our communities.

A proposed piece of federal legislation would assist undocumented immigrants in obtaining H-2A work visas and green cards. This would ensure more parity for dairy farmers as this program is usually reserved for seasonal employees. Dairy farmers, of course, need workers year-round. &#8220;The Farm Workforce Modernization Act, co-sponsored by 44 representatives including Rep. Elise Stefanik, D-Schuylerville, would provide undocumented farmworkers a pathway to permanent legal status, or green cards, and farmworkers in the year-round dairy industry access to the H-2A work visa program, which is typically reserved for seasonal and temporary agriculture industry. Proponents of the bill have said it&#8217;s a critical move to support the agriculture industry in its time of crisis due to a struggling economy, attacks on seasonal worker visa programs and an increasing number of employee audits by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials,&#8221; according to a story published Nov. 1 by the Watertown Daily Times. &#8220;The legislation stipulates that immigrant farmworkers who have worked in agriculture for at least two years prior to the introduction of the bill would be eligible for &#8216;certified agriculture worker status.&#8217; The status can be adjusted to lawful permanent residency &#151; or a green card &#151; if the immigrant has worked a specified number of years before and after the bill enacted.  &#8220;The bill would also streamline the application process for seasonal worker visas, raise wages and allow agriculture workers access to more green cards,&#8221; the story reported. &#8220;The access to the H-2A work visa would be groundbreaking for the large dairy industry in upstate New York, which was comprised of nearly 4,300 farms in 2017, according to the state Department of Agriculture. With low-skill work visas currently reserved for temporary, seasonal industry, the dairy farm industry tends to have largely undocumented workers.&#8221; Ms. Stefanik&#8217;s support of this bill reflects her understanding of the obstacles that dairy farmers in Northern New York confront. It should have enough backers to make it through the U.S. House of Representatives.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  _______________  Constituent Services  Please contact my Glens Falls office at (518) 743-0964 if you would like help with:   Federal agencies.

This week's episode covers the&nbsp;rising costs of healthcare &#150; which became more expensive thanks to Obamacare. Premiums are up. Copays are up. Deductibles are WAY up. Now, the Socialist Democrats are proposing Medicare-for-All, which would ruin the Medicare system and throw 150 MILLION people off the private insurance they like. The solution to the crisis of healthcare costs is not more government participation, it&#8217;s less. That&#8217;s why Senator Scott is working on common sense solutions to provide quality healthcare at a price American families can afford.&nbsp;See more in the video below or HERE.    Senator Rick Scott also cosponsored the&nbsp;SFC Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act of 2019&nbsp;to make sure our men and women in uniform are taken care of every step of the way.

Rick Scott Applauds Committee Passage of Legislation to Protect Florida&#8217;s Environment  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation advanced two of Senator Rick Scott and Marco Rubio&#8217;s bills to protect Florida&#8217;s environment. The Committee voted to pass the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act to expand research and understanding of blue-green algae and red tide, and the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act of 2019&nbsp;to reauthorize and modernize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 to help restore and protect our nation&#8217;s coral reef ecosystems.  Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;People from across the world come to Florida because of the state&#8217;s natural beauty. During my eight years as Governor, Florida&#8217;s annual investments to preserve the environment increased by $1 billion. I&#8217;m proud to join Senator Rubio and my colleagues on the Committee to pass the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act and the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act to build on our efforts to protect and preserve Florida&#8217;s environment for generations to come.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott Statement Ahead of President Erdogan&#8217;s Visit to White House  In advance of Turkish President Erdogan&#8217;s visit to the White House, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement.&nbsp;Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;President Trump should implement aggressive sanctions against Turkey for purchasing the S-400 missile system from Russia.&nbsp;Existing law under CAATSA requires the President to enforce sanctions, and today I&#8217;m urging the President to do this immediately unless Erdogan changes course. If he doesn&#8217;t, Congress should consider immediate action.&nbsp;We should also re-evaluate Turkey&#8217;s membership in NATO, a treaty organization created to act as a bulwark against Russian aggression. If Turkey continues to cozy up to Moscow, there is no reason they should enjoy the protections of the NATO alliance. I introduced a resolution in July that lays out these goals. I urge my colleagues to join me and present a united front.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more HERE.  &#151;  Sen. Rick Scott: Decision to Invest Retirement Savings in Communist China Threatens National Security  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) decided to shift billions of dollars from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement fund to an index fund that includes Chinese companies. Senator Scott is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan, bicameral Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, which would prevent the FRTIB from steering federal retirement savings to Communist China. Senator Rick Scott said, &#8220;I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in the FRTIB for ignoring requests from Congress to reverse this decision. Choosing to invest in Communist China threatens our national security and jeopardizes the retirement savings of hardworking Americans. There is no reason U.S. taxpayer dollars should be used to prop up companies under the control of Communist China, which continues to steal our technology, abuse human rights and build up its military to compete with us. I will continue to work to pass the Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, to protect the American people and prevent the FRTIB from supporting Communist China.&#8221;&nbsp;Read more HERE.

This year, I spent the morning talking about recycling with a group of students at Dover High School &#150; the home of the Senators! These students are taking the lead on recycling through &#8220;Teen Vision,&#8221; a community service group at Dover High that does great work like food bank drives and raising funds for breast cancer research. Every Wednesday, as many as two dozen students spend half an hour recycling bottles, cans, paper and other items at the school. I can tell you this, if Senators in D.C. have the same passion for recycling as the Senators at Dover High, we&#8217;ll be in great shape. Fortunately, a number of U.S. Senators do! I&#8217;ve been a strong advocate for recycling for 50 years, which is what eventually inspired me to start the Senate Recycling Caucus. As co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Recycling Caucus, I&#8217;m partnering with my Republican colleague, Senator John Boozman of Arkansas, to lead the caucus in exploring ways in which the federal government can encourage more recycling. This year, our bipartisan caucus has held four briefings with environmental, business and local community leaders to learn more about the state of recycling in America today.  Earlier this week, Senator Boozman and I introduced and successfully passed a resolution in the U.S. Senate to commemorate today, November 15th, as America Recycles Day. I&nbsp;believe we have a moral obligation to be devoted stewards of the environment and to leave our planet in better shape than we found it. Lately, I have been thinking about a quote from Martin Luther King:&nbsp; &#8220;Everybody can be great, because anybody can serve.&#8221; This call to service reminds me of recycling because almost anyone can help protect our environment by reducing the waste they produce, and by recycling. Over the years, I have recycled almost everything you can imagine&#151;from a green Ford Explorer to paint cans to electronics. Just last weekend, I recycled a dehumidifier, a bundle of outdoor tree lights and a ton of other stuff, too. For a small state like Delaware &#150; which is 100 miles long and 50 miles wide &#150; recycling is particularly important because we just don&#8217;t have a lot of space for landfills. Unfortunately, today, the recycling industry is facing unprecedented challenges, especially when it comes to plastics. According to the EPA, the United States recycles less than 22 percent of our discarded materials.&nbsp; If we continue down this path, the World Economic Forum predicts that we are on track to have plastic pollution outweigh fish in our world&#8217;s oceans by 2050. We need solutions that are win-wins for our economy and for our environment. I believe recycling is one of these win-win solutions. On top of cleaning up our waterways, reducing emissions and cutting the need to extract new resources, recycling and remanufacturing industries are beneficial for our economy - accounting for more than 750,000 jobs and approximately $6.7 billion in tax revenue. It&#8217;s also estimated that diverting 75% of U.S. waste from landfills and incineration to recycling by 2030 would create 2.3 million jobs! As I love to say, it&#8217;s possible to do good and do well at the same time. Recycling is something that just about every American can do each day to make a difference.

Click here! &nbsp; &nbsp;                                            Dear Cormack,&nbsp;Following a busy week meeting with folks across eastern Connecticut, here to provide you with some updates on my work as we head into Veterans Day Weekend:&nbsp;   An Important Update for our Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans  As&nbsp;we head in to this&nbsp;Veterans&nbsp;Day weekend, I&#8217;m looking forward to honoring all of our veterans at events across eastern Connecticut. Eastern Connecticut is home to so many of our nation&#8217;s veterans and active-duty service members, and it&#8217;s an honor to represent them in Congress. Today, ahead of Veterans Day, I announced the creation of a new resource page on my website to provide Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans and their families with important information on how to apply for new resources being made available to Blue Water vets through the VA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new resources are being made available following Congress&#8217;s passage and the signing-into-law of the&nbsp;Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act&nbsp;(H.R. 299), a bill that I&#8217;ve fought for years to get across the finish line. The new law will take effect on January 1, and my resource page will help provide veterans and their families with more information on the bill, and on how to file or re-file a claim with the VA so that they can receive the benefits they deserve.&nbsp; The debt we owe to&nbsp;our Blue Water Navy veterans&nbsp;for their service, and for the subsequent obstruction to their care, can never be repaid. However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act will soon be the law of the land, and it will help ensure that we do right by them moving forward.&nbsp;I encourage all Blue Water veterans, their families, and anyone else interested in taking advantage of these powerful new benefits to visit the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act resource page on my website, and to contact a Veterans Caseworker in my office so that we can make sure folks have the information they need to get the care they deserve.&nbsp;        Click here to visit my Blue Water Resource Page     Last Green Valley 25th&nbsp;Birthday&nbsp; &nbsp;Last week, it as great to join friends, community members, local leaders, and the staff of Last Green Valley (LGV) at Allen Hill Farm in Brooklyn to celebrate 25 outstanding years of the LGV. There was no better way to celebrate LGV&#8217;s big milestone than with a walking tour of the beautiful valley we&#8217;ve all worked so hard to protect, and I&#8217;m grateful to Lois&nbsp;Bruinooge, Executive Director of LGV, and her team for inviting us all out to commemorate the occasion. Following last week&#8217;s announcement of over half a million dollars in federal funding for our region&#8217;s state parks and wildlife conservation areas &#150; which included $94,250 to expand the Quinebaug River Wildlife Management Area within the Last Green Valley &#150; there was plenty to celebrate. Click here to learn more about the recently announced federal grant awards that will help bolster the Last Green Valley, and other state parks and conservation areas in our region.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you to the folks at Last Green Valley and Allen Hill Farm&nbsp;for hosting Saturday&#8217;s great event, and to everyone who joined us.&nbsp;I&#8217;m looking forward to another 25 great years!&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney at Allen Hill Farm last weekend celebrating 25 years of Last Green Valley     New Gap Financing Program for Homeowners with Crumbling Foundations  Last week, I joined Governor Lamont in announcing the launch of the Supplemental Collapsing Foundation Loan Program &#150; a new statewide program for homeowners with crumbling foundations that will allow for folks who have received assistance from the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company (CFSIC) to receive a loan from participating banks in Connecticut to cover other repairs.&nbsp;The new program will help to cover the cost of repairs that CFSIC isn&#8217;t able to cover.&nbsp;For example, if a deck, patio, or plumbing system needed to be destroyed or altered in order to repair a home&#8217;s foundation, CFSIC could help cover the cost of the foundation repair, and this new program could help cover the cost of repairing the deck, patio, plumbing system, etc.&nbsp;Homeowners can repay a loan from this program through the federal property casualty loss deduction &#150;&nbsp;for more&nbsp;information,&nbsp;visit&nbsp;my resource page&nbsp;online.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m working to find resources to&nbsp;respond to the crumbling foundations crisis at the local, state, and federal levels,&nbsp;and the new supplemental loan program is an important piece of the puzzle. However, one&nbsp;persisting gap in addressing the problem&nbsp;at every level&nbsp;has been a lack of reliable standards for evaluating what quantity of pyrrhotite must be present in concrete in order to pose a danger to a foundation&#8217;s structural integrity. The University of Connecticut and others have efforts underway to explore this missing element, but it&#8217;s clear that more research is needed to help affected homeowners and communities.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the House passed a spending package for FY2020 that included my amendment to provide NIST &#150; the leading federal expert in cement and concrete standards &#150; with $4 million to conduct research on the crumbling foundations crisis, to develop a standard testing method for at-risk homes and other structures for the presence of pyrrhotite, and to create a risk-rating scale so that homeowners, small businesses, and local governments have a better understanding of what quantity of pyrrhotite poses a danger to their foundation&#8217;s structural integrity. The Senate&#8217;s spending bill included $1.5 million for NIST to conduct this research, and now &#150; as the House and Senate are preparing to conference a final spending package &#150; we&#8217;re pushing for the research to be funded at the full $4 million agreed to here in the House.&nbsp;&nbsp;        Click here to read the full letter to the House appropriators      Community Discussion on the Lower Prescription Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp; On Wednesday, I hosted a panel discussion and community conversation at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Groton Senior Center to address the skyrocketing cost of prescription medication, and to highlight the work being done in Congress to give Americans a better deal on prescription drugs&nbsp;through bills like&nbsp;the Lower&nbsp;Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3).&nbsp; I&nbsp;was joined by an impressive&nbsp;group of regional healthcare experts to discuss how&nbsp;out-of-control&nbsp;drug prices&nbsp;are&nbsp;impacting&nbsp;people and families&nbsp;of all ages and from&nbsp;all&nbsp;from all walks of life, and to talk about&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;ways in which H.R. 3 would&nbsp;give Americans a better deal on prescription medication.&nbsp;The Lower Drug Costs Now Act&nbsp;would change the law by finally allowing for Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for fairer, lower drug prices&nbsp;-- the kind of prices they offer to other countries, but not to us. It would&nbsp;also&nbsp;charge drug manufacturers for a rebate if they increase the price of their drugs faster than inflation; it would create a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries; and&nbsp;it&nbsp;would reinvest savings into research at the National Institutes of Health, and into improving Medicare.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lower Drug Costs Now Act has a chance to be the most significant legislation on health care that the 116th Congress will accomplish. Prescription drug prices are out of control, and I&#8217;m proud that the House majority has made this issue one of our top priorities this year. In just the past few weeks, H.R. 3 was introduced, hearings were held, and my committee moved to approve the bill so that it can come before the full House of Representatives for a final vote. I&#8217;m grateful to Nora Duncan, Laura Hoch, and Judy Stein for joining me in Groton to talk more about the importance of passing this bill, and I&#8217;m looking forward to pressing ahead so that we can get H.R. 3 across the finish line once and for all.&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney speaking at Groton Senior Center this week on the Lower Drug Costs Now Act     Touring the Newly Upgraded New England Central Rail&nbsp; On Thursday morning, I was joined by officials from Genesee&nbsp;&amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W) and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) to tour the final upgrades of the New England Central Rail (NECR).&nbsp;These recently completed upgrades are an impressive sight, and&nbsp;they&#8217;ll provide firms and small businesses throughout our region with a real opportunity for economic success and growth.&nbsp; Over the past decade,&nbsp;our&nbsp;region has come together to secure federal funding&nbsp;to&nbsp;make much-needed upgrades to the NECR &#150; a rail line that&#8217;s about 100 years old, that until now hasn&#8217;t been able to move at high speeds or to tolerate heavier weights.&nbsp;In September 2014, my office helped secure an $8.3 million federal grant through the U.S. Department of Transportation to upgrade the NECR, which was the&nbsp;culmination of an effort that started five years earlier in 2009.&nbsp;In her article on the new upgrades and what they mean for our region&#8217;s economy, The Day&#8217;s Julia Bergman noted that the&nbsp;$8.3 million&nbsp;federal&nbsp;grant&nbsp;made up about 66% of the total project, while G&amp;W covered the remainder.  The completed project is a&nbsp;great achievement, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;means&nbsp;great things for our region. These upgrades will improve our freight rail service, will help&nbsp;relieve congested highways by&nbsp;getting&nbsp;big trucks off the road&nbsp;and&nbsp;placing more of that cargo onto rail lines, and will open up new&nbsp;economic&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;and frontiers&nbsp;for the many firms and small businesses here in eastern Connecticut who rely on the NECR to do business. We took a ride up the new rail line&nbsp;on Thursday, and it&#8217;s now smooth as silk &#150; no joints, no delays, no &#8216;clackety-clack&#8217; &#150; just a smooth ride. The new and improved NECR will make a big difference for the economy of our region, and I was proud to help secure the federal TIGER grant that made it happen&nbsp;        Congressman Courtney touring the final upgrades of the New England Center Rail     Thank you, as always, for taking the time to read this update. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance. Wishing everyone a happy, safe, and meaningful Veterans Day Weekend,  Have a great weekend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;Joe CourtneyMember of Congress     &nbsp;&nbsp;            OFFICE LOCATIONS        Washington, DC Office 2332 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-2076Fax: (202) 225-4977 Norwich Office 55 Main Street, Suite 250Norwich, CT 06360Phone: (860) 886-0139Fax: (860) 886-2974 Enfield Office 77 Hazard Ave, Unit JEnfield, CT 06082Phone: (860) 741-6011Fax: (860) 741-6036           |            p { margin-bottom:1em; } /***** SMARTPHONE STYLING RULES *****/ @media only screen and (max-width: 497px) { body, td, div, span, p {font-size:40px !important;} a { text-decoration:none; } *[class*=\"container\"] { width:100% !important; table-layout:auto !important;} *[class*=\"footer\"] td { font-size: 12px !important;} *[class*=\"mobileimg\"] { width: 300px !important;} *[class*=\"mobile-hidden\"] { display:none !important; } *[class*=\"mobileshare\"] img { width: 288 !important; height: 50 !important;} }  ","district":"2","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"CT","party":"Democrat","score":5.570914},{"name":"Representative Anthony Brindisi","address":"NY22AB.Outreach@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-11-06","subject":"BRINDISI BULLETIN: Supporting farmers with our new bill, bringing\r\n down health care costs & more","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }         News from Representative Brindisi                                        Hi everyone &#150; checking in with an update on our work for Upstate New York:&nbsp;    FARMERS MENTAL HEALTH: A career in agriculture is a difficult but rewarding life. Our Upstate farmers help feed the world but unfortunately many of them bear incredible burdens. Whether it&#8217;s low-prices, a trade war, or Mother Nature, much of a farmer&#8217;s bottom line is out of their control and that can add to daily stresses. That&#8217;s why I joined&nbsp;New York Republican Congressman John Katko&nbsp;and&nbsp;Congresswoman Angie Craig&nbsp;to introduce the Seeding Rural Resilience Act to help address the growing rate of suicide in rural parts of our country. This legislation will help eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health and ensure all farmers have better access to mental health care. Check out what the New York Farm Bureau and Upstate farmers are saying about our bill HERE.&nbsp;    #STOPTHEHIT: All over&nbsp;#NY22, I meet with families who rely on their health insurance to cover their medical needs, only to be hit with high deductibles, surprise emergency room bills, and unaffordable prescription drug costs. This is especially true for our nation&#8217;s seniors. This fall, Congress has an opportunity to help address rising health insurance premiums with a simple, bipartisan solution: eliminating the Health Insurance Tax (HIT). Permanently ending the HIT would protect some of the most vulnerable in our communities, especially seniors, and help address rising health care costs for many Americans. Nearly 40% of New Yorkers and 34% of Americans on Medicare are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Without a repeal of the HIT, some will be left paying more for their care. Read more about the work I&#8217;m doing to eliminate the Health Insurance Tax HERE.&nbsp;    MAKING THE VA ACCESSIBLE: The House Veterans&#8217; Affairs Committee recently met to discuss and debate legislation to help Veterans in&nbsp;NY-22&nbsp;and across the country. We advanced my bill to make the VA more accessible to women Veterans and ensure the VA Women Veterans Call Center is accessible via text message. I&#8217;m proud to work with Democrats and Republicans to improve the lives of our Veterans.    ENOUGH IS ENOUGH: Continued inaction from the&nbsp;International Joint Commission (IJC) means millions of dollars in damage for Lake Ontario homeowners and business owners. The IJC is responsible for governing Lake Ontario water levels, and they must take concrete steps to prevent flooding in 2020. I will write to the IJC every week until they take action to lower the water levels of Lake Ontario and share the stories of impacted residents and businessowners. The IJC needs to be held accountable, and if they aren&#8217;t being responsive to the communities&#8217; needs, the IJC needs to hear these concerns each and every week.&nbsp; If you have been affected by Lake Ontario flooding and the IJC&#8217;s inaction, you can submit your story HERE to help us&nbsp;#FloodTheIJC.    PROTECTING FOUR-LEGGED FRIENDS: As a parent of a rescue dog, I know how important animals are to families, and we need to give law enforcement the tools to hold abusers accountable. I was proud to co-sponsor the PACT Act and work with Democrats and Republicans to get it passed in the House.    WORTH THE READ: Every student deserves a quality education that can lead to a good-paying job. Whether it&#8217;s community college, an apprenticeship, certification program, or a four-year degree, we must to do more to ensure every student has a path to success. When I served in the New York State Assembly, I pushed the state to allow high school students to pursue CTE Diplomas and receive training to begin careers in advanced manufacturing and the trades. I will continue working to ensure all Upstate students have opportunities that work best for them.    &nbsp;    A VOTE FOR TRANSPARENCY: The constituents I represent want to judge the facts of the impeachment investigation themselves, and I support them.

Showcasing America on the World StageThe World Expo is an incredible international event that brings together cultures from around the globe. Ensuring the United States has a presence there to showcase America &#151; in particular Houston &#151; is incredibly important. That is why I&nbsp;worked with Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN)&nbsp;H.R. 4842, the Expositions Provide Opportunities Act of 2019. This bill ensures America has a place at the 2020 World Expo that will take place in Dubai. Participating in this global endeavor sets the stage for Houston to compete to be a future host of the event. It also allows us to show people across the globe why our great Texas city has emerged as a top destination for worldwide events. You can read&nbsp;my full&nbsp;statement here.  Combatting Domestic ViolenceOctober marked National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, where we shine a light on this darkness that affects people of all walks of life. As co-chair of the Victims' Rights Caucus, I&#8217;m proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress to denounce and put a stop to this heinous act. No one should ever be the victim of violence by their spouse or significant other. If you or a loved one are a victim of domestic violence, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. Working together we can end domestic violence once and for all.         Olson with the Victims' Rights Caucus standing in solidarity with domestic violence survivors    Taking Action Against TurkeyTurkish forces have engaged in a ruthless&nbsp;attack&nbsp;against our Kurdish allies, with many of them being civilians. While I did not agree&nbsp;with the decision to draw down our military presence, I do believe sanctions against Turkey for&nbsp;their&nbsp;abhorrent actions are needed.&nbsp;Last week, I voted for the bipartisan bill H.R. 4695, the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act,&nbsp;which holds Turkey accountable for their invasion of&nbsp;northeast Syria against the Kurds. I&#8217;m proud to support these sanctions that apply needed pressure on Turkey to end its offensive, while also requiring the Trump Administration to develop a plan to ensure the ISIS detainees held at Syrian facilities remain imprisoned. Our allies, our national security and our reputation on the world stage require nothing less. You can read&nbsp;my full statement here.  Giving Medicare Recipients Real-Time Price ToolsSeniors deserve transparency when it comes to the costs of their prescription drugs. Sadly, more Americans are leaving the pharmacy without needed medicine thanks to skyrocketing and often-times unexpected drug costs.   I'm&nbsp;pleased to announce that in&nbsp;the House, we&nbsp;passed&nbsp;a package of healthcare bills&nbsp;that included&nbsp; a bill I worked on called the Shop Rx Act of 2019. This bill will give physicians real-time information on prescription drug prices so that&nbsp;they and their patients can make informed decisions on treatment options.

He has a few favorites we read over and over again, but last week, I told him a new story - one that isn't in the history books yet. *It was about one of the world's most evil monsters being defeated by the strongest and greatest super hero known to man - a U.S. soldier.* Of course, I spared him the real-life details of the daring raid targeting ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But I made sure he knows America's heroes don't wear capes - they wear dog tags. And they serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. *First and foremost, I want to congratulate and thank our U.S. Special Operations Forces for successfully taking down al-Baghdadi.* As Fort Bragg's Congressman, I'm thankful we didn't suffer any casualties during the raid. I also want to thank their Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, who made the decision to send our troops in. [image = President Trump watching from the Situation Room as ISIS leader al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid. Make no mistake, last week was an important milestone in the Trump Administration's defeat of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. *The death of al-Baghdadi - long considered the most wanted man in the world - is a tremendous victory. *Our Special Operations Forces sent a loud and clear message: terrorists will not win. They won't outlast or outmatch the commitment and the skill of America's heroes, and we will not stop rooting out terrorists wherever they hide. By the same token, I was privileged last week to pay tribute to and honor another American super hero of our ongoing fight against terror.* I was incredibly humbled to join President Trump to present Master Sergeant Matthew Williams our nation's highest military award for combat valor. *Master Sgt. Williams, a member of 3rd Special Forces Group and an 8th District constituent, was awarded the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry while serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On April 6, 2008, then-Sgt. Williams served as a Special Forces weapons sergeant in Afghanistan. His team was on a mission in Shok Valley, Nuristan Province, Afghanistan to capture or kill an Afghan militia leader and warlord whose forces attacked U.S. troops and the Afghan government for years. During their mission that day, they were engaged by intense enemy machine gun fire, rocket-propelled grenades, and snipers. *Master Sgt. Williams led a counter attack and faced unimaginable obstacles - a fast-moving, ice-cold and waist-deep river; a terraced and frozen mountain; and an estimated 200 enemy fighters.* Through it all, he braved enemy fire and completely disregarded his own safety to ensure the safety of his teammates. Master Sgt. Williams's actions ensured not a single American soldier died at Shok Valley that day, and he prevented the lead element of the assault force from being overrun by the enemy. [image = It was an honor to meet Master Sgt. Williams and personally thank him for his incredible service. When speaking about Master Sgt. William's mission, Lt. Gen. John F. Mulholland, former commander of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command said, *\"If you saw what you heard today in a movie, you would shake your head and say, 'that didn't happen.' But it does, every day.\"* This is representative of all the folks at Fort Bragg and 3rd Special Forces Group. *We have people doing incredible things and families making incredible sacrifices every day. The history books will remember these heroes and we will always be grateful for their actions and their courage, and I'm proud to call them our friends, family and neighbors here in the 8th District.* *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* [image = [link 1] [image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] [image = [link 6] [image = [link 7] [image = [link 8] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":3.8865461},{"name":"Congresswoman Virginia Foxx","address":"virginia.foxx.enews@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-11-01","subject":"two new bills for NC05","body":"Foxx Report for the Week of July 14, 2017 Over the past few years, we have only begun to comprehend the horrors of human trafficking and how it has established a foothold in the United States. Thanks to the vigilance of faith-based groups, humanitarians across the globe and the courage of survivors, we are learning more about the tactics and loopholes human traffickers exploit to prey on the most vulnerable among us. On Wednesday the House passed H.R. 2664, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act, which ensures Department of Labor employees have the tools and resources they need to detect cases of labor or sexual exploitation while investigating workforce law violations. Human trafficking is an issue that demands our ongoing attention, and more solutions are needed. This legislation builds on the bipartisan work weve already accomplished. Joint Employer Scheme Threatens Job Creation and Entrepreneurship This week the House Committee on Education and the Workforce examined the growing threat to job creation, entrepreneurship and small businesses posed by the expanded definition of joint employer under federal labor laws. Opportunities through franchising, as well as contracting, have empowered countless Americans to climb the economic ladder and obtain a better quality of life for their families. Sadly, unelected bureaucrats who have never owned a business or made a payroll launched an unprecedented attack on these successful business models that so many rely on. It began when the National Labor Relations Board issued an extreme joint employer decision, which distorted the definition of what it means to be an employer. Then, the Obama administration took this radical new policy a step further, spreading it to other areas of federal labor law. Its time to put an end to this extreme and partisan policy that does nothing to help American workers and makes it harder for entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams. It is my hope that hearing firsthand accounts of the job-crushing impact of the expanded joint employer standard will build new momentum here in Congress to find the solution Americans need. Providing for the Common Defense of the United States Providing for the common defense of the United States of America is the federal governments primary responsibility. This week the House passed H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which maintains the nations defense readiness and ensures the continued success of our military personnel by providing them with the best equipment, skills development and compensation. Carolinians in the Capitol This week I met with a variety of individuals and organizations from North Carolina, including Dr. Gary Green of Forsyth Technical Community College, students Logan Short and Jonathan Piland, Sharon Jeffries-Jones of BB&T, Harold Stone from Mount Airys Renfro Corporation and a group from Forsyth County attending the National Association of Drug Court Professionals annual conference. Whats Coming Up? Next week the House will take up legislation to improve our nations energy infrastructure. We will consider the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act to modernize the import and export of oil, natural gas and electricity transmission. We also will debate the Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, a bill to increase cooperation between federal and state agencies when approving natural gas infrastructure. Our economy is in dire need of a new infrastructure framework to take advantage of robust supplies of domestic energy, and I look forward to supporting these measures to help accomplish this undertaking.

As we kick off the month of November, I wanted to update you on an exciting project I worked on in Washington, D.C. in October. Last week, I introduced a bipartisan resolution that would formally recognize October as National Dyslexia Awareness Month. Dyslexia is the most common learning disability, affecting one in five people and hindering their ability to read. Many students with dyslexia don't perform well because their dyslexia isn't identified, leaving them without the tools they need to navigate the challenges dyslexia presents. That is exactly why this resolution is so important. When students are screened for dyslexia early on, teachers can teach those with dyslexia how to become fluent readers, despite their disability. This is accomplished through focused, evidence-based intervention, promoting self-awareness and self-empowerment, and the provision of necessary accommodations that ensure success in school. Dyslexia has significant educational implications that must be addressed, and it is our responsibility to spread awareness so that our students are given the tools they need to excel in reading. I hope you are able to enjoy the fall weather this weekend and stay warm. Until next week, Bruce Westerman Arkansas' Fourth District Email Updates* *By subscribing to my email updates, you are authorizing me to send regular email updates from my office to your email account. *Earlier in October, I read a chapter of \"Because of Winn Dixie\" as part of the annual Garland County Reads event in Hot Springs.* Like I mentioned, I introduced a bipartisan resolution that would designate October as National Dyslexia Awareness Month. I was so glad to work on this legislation with Congresswoman Julia Brownley, a fellow co-chair of the Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. You can watch a video update from us here [link 2]. I'm honored I had the chance to stop by USO's event and help assemble some care packages on Wednesday! USO provides so many resources to our men and women in uniform, and these care packages are a great way to show service members that they're in our thoughts and prayers during deployment. I ended last week with some time in Magnolia. I kicked off the day with breakfast at the Mule Kick, where I learned about their green initiative. After that, I hosted a Coffee with Your Congressman at the Perfect Cup. It was great to give an update on what's happening in Washington and answer questions. Thank you to everyone who came out! After that, I toured Texas CLT, a new timber manufacturing company that brought dozens of jobs to Columbia County.

And we all know you cant go trick-or-treating without a costume and a bag to collect goodies. No problem, the federal governments got you covered. Federal agencies have paid more than $250,000 to construct their own custom-made costumes. This includes $5,000 spent by the Department of Energy to create a costumed character modeled after the Grim Reaper called the Green Reaper. And the list  goes on, and on, and on. Government agencies are also spending millions of taxpayer dollars on tote bags AND swag to fill them up, including: * $605,000 for coloring books, * $60,000 on key chains, * $33,000 for snuggies, * $17,000 for koozies, and * $16,000 for fidget spinners. All of these are part of the governments pricey public relations (PR) and advertising campaigns, which collectively cost taxpayers more than $1.4 billion  every single year. While these marketing efforts do include legitimate activities, like recruiting for the armed forces and alerting the public to potential health or safety threats, much of it is purely propaganda with little or no value for taxpayers, such as: * U.S. Embassy in the U.K. paid to send British social media influencers  on an all-expenses paidby the taxpayers of coursetwo week junket to film sets and the location of U.S. TV shows to promote American values. * The State Department spent $630,000 of taxpayer money  buying ghost followers on Facebook. * The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spent nearly $10,000 producing a Zombie apocalypse survival guide  . These expenditures will haunt taxpayers for years to come. They also come at the expense of real national priorities. The $1.4 billion spent on government PR and advertising every year, for example, is twice the amount dedicated to breast cancer research  . Thats unacceptable, folks. _____ October Squeal Award: Federal agencies for taxpayer-funded swag  For these reasons, I am awarding my October Squeal Award to the federal agencies that have put a premium on promoting their own public image. It is also why I have introduced  the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government Act, or SWAG Act, which would bag the swag and end unnecessary taxpayer-funded propaganda and require these kinds of expenditures to be made transparent and available for public scrutiny. _____ Do you have an example of government waste or inefficiencies that I should take a look at?

Others enlist for duty and honor. Many join to be a part of something bigger than oneself. And everyone serves to defend and protect our great country. As Vice President Mike Pence recently told service members stationed abroad, \"You come from the rest of us, but you are the best of us - heroes all.\" While I didn't have the honor to serve in our Armed Forces, many of my family members have and I consider serving as your United States Representative my chance to fight for our active duty service members, veterans and your families in Congress.* I wanted to share a few updates on legislation I've been working on that will go a long way to support veterans.* Right now, my staff and I spend a lot of time cutting through needless bureaucracy and red tape for veterans who need access to their service and medical records - a process that can drag on for months. *Veterans regularly come to my office with stacks and stacks of papers, service records and medical files.* Sometimes it's enough papers and files to fill several boxes because the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) still hasn't transitioned to electronic health records. It's almost 2020 - it's past time for our veterans to have the best technology available when it comes to their care. *I'm proud to tell you the Trump Administration has made fixing this problem a top priority. *Under President Donald Trump's leadership, the VA is working to deliver a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA. This will grant doctors and veterans alike access to the complete picture of a veteran's health information - improving the VA's ability to care for veterans.* This is a massive, 10-year modernization effort and I want to make sure we do it right. I recently introduced the *Department of Veterans Affairs Electronic Health Record Advisory Committee Act* (H.R. 4693), a bipartisan bill to ensure we have transparency and accountability to make this transition as seamless as possible for veterans. *The new electronic health record system is too important to veterans' health care for the VA to get wrong, and my bill will provide strong oversight.* * [image = In this same vein, it's important to ensure professionals who care for our veterans are the very best available.* I was extremely concerned when I found out the VA was hiring some providers with revoked licenses. *That's why I introduced a bill to ensure there are clinical reviews for all care recommended by these providers.

Senator Ernst noted that while the House has found time to do a lot of things&#151;like continue their partisan expedition toward impeaching the president, passing legislation without a pay raise for our troops, and spending a lot of &#8220;energy&#8221; discussing the job killing Green New Deal&#151;they have yet to pass the USMCA trade agreement that will benefit Iowa&#8217;s farmers, manufacturers, and small businesses.    Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst's remarks  Senator Ernst also applauded the recent announcement of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement, citing the nearly $1 billion worth of Iowa exports sent to Japan in 2018, as well as China&#8217;s pledge to purchase additional agriculture products from American farmers.    Click here or the image above to watch Senator Ernst's remarks.  Working to Expand Broadband for Iowa&#8217;s Rural Communities&nbsp;  Continuing her efforts to expand access to broadband in Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst is supporting bipartisan legislation aimed at improving the accuracy of broadband maps, which have proven to be drastically inaccurate in some instances in Iowa, so resources are targeted to areas where they are needed most. The bipartisan bill builds on Senator Ernst&#8217;s request to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to improve broadband mapping. The Broadband DATA Act, or the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act, would enhance the FCC&#8217;s data collection process and improve accuracy in its mapping. The bill aims to enable federal agencies to better target the areas most in need of funding, close the remaining broadband coverage gaps, and ensure improved accountability and transparency.  Securing Resources for Mental Health Support for Iowa&#8217;s Farmers  Iowa farmers work tirelessly from sunrise to sundown, in the rain and the shine, to feed and fuel the world. Their work isn&#8217;t easy, and mental health issues, including suicide, are becoming all too common in the agriculture community. That&#8217;s why Senator Ernst worked hard to make sure her bipartisan bill to provide resources for mental health services to farmers was included in the Farm Bill. Senator Ernst&#8217;s Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act, which was included in the 2018 Farm Bill, is being implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This week it was announced that two Iowa projects will be receiving resources to help provide mental health support to Iowa&#8217;s agriculture community. Iowa Awards:&nbsp;  AgriSafe Network, a national non-profit located in Peosta, Iowa, was awarded $480,000 in grant funds from NIFA for their grant application, which coalesces a group of partners in the southern region of the United States to form the Southern Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (S-FRSAN). The goal of the partnership is to deliver customized stress assistance services to the various agriculture populations across the region. Services are modeled off of a holistic approach to caring for the agricultural community by focusing on occupational hazards as well as individual, social and mental health components that may affect a farmer&#8217;s well-being. Iowa State University&#8217;s project titled, Farm and Ranch Wellness, was also awarded $480,000 by NIFA, which seeks to develop an online resource database that connects farmers and ranchers to stress assistance programs, including stress hotlines and prescription drug abuse education to farmers, ranchers and their advocates located in the North Central Region. Pressing Army Corps for Update on Flood Recovery Efforts&nbsp;  At a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing this week, Senator Joni Ernst, a native of Southwest Iowa, continued to press the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) on their efforts to rebuild levees damaged during last year&#8217;s flooding, and their work to improve flood protection infrastructure to combat future flooding.

At their own great risk, the Montagnards provided critical intelligence and fought alongside our Armed Forces during the Vietnam War. After the war, the U.S. resettled thousands of Montagnards as refugees to escape persecution from the Vietnamese government, violations that are still occurring today. Given the choice between other U.S. states and North Carolina, most Montagnards decided to resettle in North Carolina because of their close ties to the Green Berets. This week, I was honored to introduce a resolution with Senator Tillis to recognize the heroic contributions of the Montagnards and to continue to call on the government of Vietnam to respect their human rights.

I was honored to join President Trump as he visited the hardworking men and women who are driving innovation in the American shale energy industry. The president has been a tireless supporter of Pennsylvania energy, and thanks to his leadership, we are seeing tremendous job creation and unprecedented wage growth. Natural gas production, and the jobs that go with it, continue to thrive under the pro-growth policies of the Trump Administration. Oil and natural gas production in Pennsylvania isn't just about energy, it's also about the jobs in industries like plastic manufacturing that go with it. The Trump Administration and I continue to stand up against Democratic calls to 'ban fracking' and implement policies like the 'Green New Deal,' both of which would devastate our local economy and force employers to shut their doors. I am grateful to President Trump for his visit, and for all he has done to make southwestern Pennsylvania a great place to live and work. I look forward to working with the administration to continue the Pennsylvania energy and manufacturing boom. Listen to me discuss the visit and the Marcellus shale boom with Marty Griffin on KDKA Radio here [link 1]. [image = *Condemning and Censuring Adam Schiff* On Monday, House Democrats once again proved their impeachment inquiry into President Trump is nothing more than a partisan witch hunt when they blocked consideration of a resolution to censure House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff. For months, Chairman Schiff has deliberately misled the American people. He fabricated evidence of Russian collusion, falsely recited a phone conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian President, and lied about his dealings with the whistleblower. House Republicans attempted to bring this misconduct to light by requesting a vote on H.Res. 630, a resolution I cosponsored that condemns and censures Chairman Schiff. Unfortunately, House Democrats used a procedural maneuver to prevent such a vote, choosing instead to hide this important information from the public. If my colleagues across the aisle insist on undoing the results of the 2016 election, they should at least be honest and transparent with the American people. *Passing Legislation to Combat Animal Cruelty* [image = [link 2] I was proud to speak on the floor in support of the bipartisan Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, which passed the House on Tuesday. As a cosponsor of the bill, I strongly support this effort to combat animal cruelty so we can better protect our nation's animals from abuse and torture. In 2010, Congress passed the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act to address the trade in obscene videos of live animals being crushed, burned, or subjected to other forms of heinous cruelty. While this was an important first step, the law only bans the trade in video depictions of cruelty, not the underlying act of the cruelty itself. The PACT Act addresses this gap by prohibiting the underlying acts of animal cruelty that occur on federal property or affect interstate commerce, regardless of whether a video is produced. As a former district judge, I served on the frontlines of our judicial system. I witnessed firsthand the connection between animal cruelty and violence toward people. In 2017, when I was a member of the Pennsylvania Senate, we passed Libre's Law, which increased penalties for animal abuse. I was proud to continue my work on animal welfare by supporting the PACT Act to make animal abuse a federal offense.

The letter in full can be found here [link 4]. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats' decision to withhold impeachment inquiry information from Republican Members of Congress should trouble all Americans. My colleagues across the aisle have thrown transparency and fairness out the window as they conduct their sham impeachment in secret behind closed doors. Conducting an inquiry in secret and leaking select, cherry-picked materials proves this is a politically motivated inquiry. The American people elected their Congressional representatives--both Republicans and Democrats--to be their voices in Washington. They are ignoring the will of the Americans who don't share their political views by denying Republican members the opportunity to view impeachment documents. *Pennsylvanian **Arnold Palmer Celebrated with Postage Stamp* Arnold \"The King\" Palmer joins Fred Rogers as the second constituent of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District to receive a forever stamp. Arnold Palmer touched millions of lives through his storied golf career and philanthropic efforts, so it is only right that we honor this great man. Earlier this year, I led [link 5] the effort to ask the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to honor Mr. Palmer with a USCG vessel bearing his name and legacy. As a former Navy JAG, I am hopeful this bipartisan effort will help to preserve Mr. Palmer's legacy of service to country and community for future generations. Those throughout southwestern Pennsylvania are grateful for his honorable service in the Coast Guard, his philanthropy, and his dedication to our community. *Recognizing National Prescription Drug Take Back Day* [image = Tomorrow, Saturday, October 26th is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.

Here are some highlights:    PROTECTING OUR ALLIES: I joined Democrats and Republicans to condemn the Administration&#8217;s reckless and destabilizing behavior in Syria. This Administration&#8217;s lack of a plan in Syria is hurting America&#8217;s reputation with allies, helping ISIS potentially regain territory our troops and partners held, and harming our ability to win the war on terror. We cannot afford to lose the progress we&#8217;ve made against ISIS and their partners. Congress needs to reassert their role in our national security and demand the Administration present a cohesive plan to responsibly withdraw from Syria.   ADVANCING AG RESEARCH: In our House Agriculture Committee hearing, I fought for important research dollars for&nbsp;Cornell University. This world-class research helps&nbsp;NY-22&nbsp;dairy farmers compete worldwide. Watch more HERE.    BRINGING COSTS DOWN: Democrats and Republicans agree: that hardworking Americans are paying way too much for prescription drugs. I&#8217;m working with the&nbsp;Blue Dog Coalition&nbsp;and members on both sides of the aisle to find real solutions to lower drug costs and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable. No one should have to choose between feeding their family and paying for the medicine they need.    GETTING RESULTS FOR VETERANS: I am focused on getting results for Upstate Veterans, and I was proud to work with Democrats and Republicans to help pass the Homeless Veteran Families Act. This legislation will increase funding to help shelter and care for homeless Veterans with dependent children and help end Veteran homelessness.    CLEAN WATER FOR MEXICO: Access to safe and drinkable water is important for all communities. We recently announced the town of Mexico will receive $280,000 to help construct a new water system for residents currently on private wells that might have been contaminated. From our outdated water systems to our crumbling roads and bridges, I will continue fighting to make needed investments in our Upstate infrastructure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FRIENDS OLD AND NEW: Great to see my friend and NYS Senator Joe Griffo from Rome, New York, when he stopped by my office! In the New York State Assembly and in Congress, Senator Griffo and I will continue to work together to fight for Upstate priorities and get real results for our community. I also had the honor of meeting the President of the Republic of Italy, Sergio Mattarella. As a proud Italian-American and representative of many Italian-Americans in&nbsp;NY-22, this meeting is one I will remember for a long time.   FRIDAY NIGHT FUN: Got to catch a Utica Comets game with Erica and the kids to wrap up a busy week. We are so fortunate to be home to two great professional American Hockey League (AHL) teams in NY-22: The Utica Comets in Oneida County and the Binghamton Devils in Broome County.

This legislation would make certain improvements to CRCL. Congressman Green released the following statement: &#8220;H.R. 4713 &#150; the Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Authorization Act &#150; will improve the accountability, transparency, and responsibility of the office that is intended to oversee civil rights and liberties. The legislation calls for investigative reports and reviews of Department programs to be publicized on the Department&#8217;s website and establishes CRCL officers to guarantee improved oversight. A significant requirement of H.R. 4713 is that CRCL officers must submit an annual report of their findings to the President and Congress. &#8220;As Members of Congress, it is imperative that we provide safeguards against bad DHS policies and programs that effectively threaten constitutional rights.&nbsp; I thank Chairman Bennie Thompson for his leadership as well as my colleagues on the House Committee on Homeland Security for approving this important measure.

Al Green (TX-09), Judy Chu (CA-27), Sylvia Garcia (TX-29),\r\n and William Lacy Clay (MO-01) Introduce Limited English Proficiency Data\r\n Acquisition in Mortgage Lending Act of 2019","body":"    Reps. Al Green (TX-09), Judy Chu (CA-27), Sylvia Garcia (TX-29), and William Lacy Clay (MO-01) Introduce Limited English Proficiency Data Acquisition in Mortgage Lending Act of 2019  (Washington, D.C.) &#150; On Tuesday, October 22, 2019, Congressman Al Green, Congresswoman Judy Chu, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, and Congressman William Lacy Clay introduced H.R. 4783 and released the following statement: Congressman Al Green said, &#8220;Access to credit and homeownership is a common struggle for far too many new Americans and immigrant communities, in part because of strong language barriers. Offering information essential to the homebuying process in the preferred language of the borrower is critical to ensuring this access for persons with limited English proficiency (LEP). The language preference question &#150; previously included on the Universal Residential Loan Application (URLA) form which is used for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &#150; serves to help regulators gather pertinent information on borrowers&#8217; language preferences so that we can decrease the likelihood of language barriers presenting a deterrent or challenge for prospective LEP homebuyers. In August 2019, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) removed this critical question, and their arbitrary decision perpetuates the risk of predatory lending practices that many LEP homebuyers fall prey to because of language barriers. The LEP Data Acquisition in Mortgage Lending Act of 2019, introduced by my colleagues Congresswoman Chu, Congresswoman Garcia, Congressman Clay, and I today, will require the language preference question to be reinstated on the URLA. We must continue collecting language preference information to ensure a fair and equitable approach to homebuying for all persons, regardless of their primary language.&#8221; According to CAPAC Chair Congresswoman Judy Chu, &#8220;Buying a home is already a difficult enough process without language barriers that leave non-English speaking homebuyers susceptible to abuse. When homebuyers are unable to understand their loans it isn&#8217;t just unjust to them, it&#8217;s harmful to our economy. That&#8217;s why, as Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I&#8217;m proud to co-lead this important piece of legislation to ensure that a language preference question is included in the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA). Over one third of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are limited English proficient (LEP) and struggle with language barriers that make it difficult to navigate the complex financial process of buying a home. In fact, during the 2008 financial crisis, many LEP borrowers lost their homes due to language barriers that made it difficult to comprehend the terms of their loans. This is why Congressman Green and I urged FHFA Director Calabria to reverse his reckless decision to remove a preferred language question from the URLA when we met with him last month. But he said he would only do so if it was written in statute, so that&#8217;s exactly what this bill does. We must ensure that all Americans, regardless of their English proficiency, have the opportunity to access credit and purchase a home.&#8221; &#8220;In removing the preferred language question from the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA), Director Calabria is making it harder for homebuyers with limited English proficiency to buy a home, particularly in immigrant communities and communities of color across the country,&#8221; added Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia. &#8220;This decision is reckless and unnecessary. It will only exacerbate barriers to homeownership for folks who speak another language other than English as their primary language. Homeownership is one of the primary ways families can accumulate wealth over time. Removing the preferred language question from the URLA will only hurt homebuyers with limited English proficiency. I urge Director Calabria to reverse his decision on this issue.&#8221; &#8220;As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance, I have made inclusion and diversity a priority as we seek to make housing more affordable to all Americans,&#8221; said Congressman Wm. Lacy Clay.&nbsp; &#8220;In order to help close the racial wealth gap it is critical that all Americans have a fair shot at homeownership.&nbsp; I applaud my fellow committee members Ms. Garcia of the CHC and Congressman Al Green, as we work to help our great nation live up to it&#8217;s potential.&#8221;  H.R. 4783 or the LEP Data Acquisition in Mortgage Lending Act of 2019 has been endorsed by the following organizations: Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), AFR Language Access Task Force, California Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Responsible Lending, Consumer Action, NAACP, National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA), National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development (National CAPACD), National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income clients), National Fair Housing Alliance, National Housing Resource Center, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Woodstock Institute.    # # #             &nbsp;   &nbsp;                 Washington, DC 2347 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515Phone: (202) 225-7508Fax: (202) 225-2947Hours: M-F 9AM-5PM EST Houston Office 3003 South Loop West, Suite 460Houston, TX 77054Phone: 713-383-9234Fax: 713-383-9202Hours: M-F 9AM-5PM CST          Unsubscribe |  |            /***** SMARTPHONE STYLING RULES *****/ @media only screen and (max-width: 497px) { *[class*=\"container\"] { width:100% !important; table-layout:auto !important;} }  ","district":"29","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"TX","party":"Democrat","score":6.506721},{"name":"Senator Jeanne Shaheen","address":"newsletter@shaheen.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-22","subject":"A tragic toll","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                 Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window                &nbsp;      October 22, 2019  Dear Friend,&nbsp;  It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate. Last week was a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues I&#8217;ve been working on.&nbsp;  Helping Law Enforcement Officers Cope as They Keep Us Safe    WATCH:&nbsp;WMUR reports&nbsp;on Shaheen&#8217;s after meeting with law enforcement officials  Law enforcement officers are under enormous pressures as they protect our communities every day and it&#8217;s taking a tragic toll. Nationally, we now lose more officers to suicide than in the line of duty. Sadly, New Hampshire is not exempt. We have lost far too many officers in the past several years. I was at the Nashua Police Department last week to discuss how important it is that we continue to talk about this crisis publicly so we can begin to address it. I&#8217;m fighting for resources to provide support to all of our first responders and their families. We owe it to these public servants who risk everything to keep us safe every day.  PFAS Health Impact Study Moves Forward And You May Be Able to Help  This has been a long time coming: the PFAS Health Impact Study is getting underway and is seeking participants. This study, which is focusing on contamination at the Pease International Tradeport, is the first of its kind in the nation and will ultimately help Granite Staters and impacted populations around the country affected by PFAS contamination by shedding light on the health risks. This study has been a top priority of mine for the last several years because it will help deliver the answers that New Hampshire families who&#8217;ve experienced PFAS contamination so desperately need. If you suspect that you or someone you know has been impacted by PFAS exposure at Pease, I encourage you to consider participating in this study and help spread the word about the need for participation. The more people participate, the more useful and accurate the data will be, which will help deliver answers. Find out how to get involved&nbsp;here.  New Law Honors the Legacy of Christa McAuliffe   Christa McAuliffe  My legislation, the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act, was just recently signed into law to pay tribute to the legacy of Christa McAuliffe. Fittingly, it came the just days before astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir stepped outside the International Space Station for the all-female spacewalk in human history.&nbsp; The Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act requires that a commemorative coin honoring Christa be created, with proceeds from this coin going to support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. I&#8217;m heartened by the bipartisan support that ushered this law through Congress, and I am glad that it will&nbsp;ensure future generations of students in New Hampshire and across the country know Christa&#8217;s inspiring story and&nbsp;get involved in STEM.&nbsp;  A Disastrous Decision by President Trump in Syria    Shaheen highlighting the dangers of the President's decision during her Senate floor remarks  Last week, I&nbsp;spoke on the floor of the Senate to express my alarm at President Trump&#8217;s reckless decision to withdraw American troops from Northeast Syria and abandon our Kurdish partners in the region who helped us pushback against ISIS&#8217; once-significant territorial gains. Their efforts and sacrifices, including the death of over 11,000 of their own forces, allowed the U.S. to hold a strategically significant area in northeastern Syria. The President&#8217;s shortsighted decision, unfortunately,&nbsp;gave Turkey the green light to launch an incursion into the region which has resulted in ISIS fighters escaping prison, the slaughter of our partners and innocent civilians, and a security vacuum which is being filled like Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. When I visited this region in July 2018, I witnessed firsthand the&nbsp;value of U.S. troops in the region. Their presence helped&nbsp;stabilize this region, allowing its people to rebuild and recover from years of horrific oppression by ISIS. Learn more about the bipartisan efforts I support to hold Turkey&#8217;s President Erdogan accountable for his actions from my floor speech here.  Update from Hampton Harbor Where Dredging Has Begun    Shaheen speaks to Major Mark Gilman, Deputy Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers - New England District while visiting the dredging operation at Hampton-Seabrook Harbor  Yesterday, I stopped by Hampton-Seabrook Harbor, where I got to see the start of dredging operations to combat the extreme shoaling that has prevented boats from getting in and out of the harbor during low tides. The harbor plays a critical role in the Seacoast economy supporting hundreds of jobs. Dredging was needed to keep it safe for the dozens of party-fishing boats, numerous fishing and lobster boats, emergency response craft, as well as approximately 1,500 recreational vessels that are launched through the Hampton River Marina. This has been a top priority of mine and you can hear more about our efforts to secure funding for, and the positive impacts of the harbor dredging here&nbsp;here.  Need Help? Contact My Office  One of my most important responsibilities as a U.S. Senator is assisting New Hampshire residents who need help navigating federal agencies. I&#8217;ve worked with my staff to help Granite Staters avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, deliver delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance, and access VA benefits, among many other services. If you have an issue with a federal agency, you can open a case&nbsp;here. If the matter is time-sensitive, you can call my Manchester office at (603) 647-7500. Here are a few examples of how my office has helped Granite Staters.  Dr. Tim Gardner, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center: &nbsp;Dr. Tim Gardner of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center called my office with an urgent request: a patient in his care had pancreatic cancer and needed a drug recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). My staff reached out to the FDA, whose staff contacted the manufacturer, which resulted in the drug being secured along with the necessary permission to use it for the patient.&nbsp; Kevin Dremel, Keene: &nbsp;Kevin contacted my office after he had difficulty getting in touch with the New Hampshire Liquor Commission regarding expanding his cracker business to a kitchen in a local winery. My staff reached out to the Governor&#8217;s office, which resulted in the Liquor Commission following up with Kevin and authorizing his request to sublease the space. Brian Collins, Ashland: Brian got in touch with my staff after erroneously receiving word from the IRS that he owed a penalty for failing to pay his 2015 taxes on time. An error had the IRS mistakenly listed Brian&#8217;s tax return as having been submitted late. Brian had tried to reach the IRS by phone to resolve the mix-up but his efforts were unsuccessful. We contacted the IRS on his behalf, and provided Brian&#8217;s original tax return with the correct on time date. Upon review, the IRS realized this mistake and erroneous penalty was cleared from Brian&#8217;s account.&nbsp;  Sincerely,    ###  To opt out of future eNewletters, click here.      &nbsp;             &nbsp; Washington, DC506 Hart SOBWashington, DC 20510Phone: (202) 224-2841 Manchester, NH2 Wall Street Ste. 220Manchester, NH&nbsp;03101Phone: (603) 647-7500 Claremont, NH50 Opera House Sq.Claremont, NH 03743Phone: (603) 542-4872 Nashua, NH60 Main StreetNashua, NH 03060Phone: (603) 883-0196 &nbsp;             &nbsp; Dover, NH340 Central Avenue Suite 205Dover, NH 03820Phone: (603) 750-3004 Berlin, NH961 Main St.Berlin, NH 03570Phone: (603) 752-6300 Keene, NH12 Gilbo Ave. Suite CKeene, NH 03431Phone: (603) 358-6604 &nbsp;            ","title":"Senator, 2nd Class","gender":"F","state":"NH","party":"Democrat","score":3.0548613},{"name":"Representative Vicky Hartzler","address":"mo04vhima@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-21","subject":"A Big Week for MO-4!","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                                                       Dear Friends, This past week has been special for the Columbia community. Mizzou was named by the Princeton Review as part of &#8220;The Best 385 Colleges,&#8221; &#8220;The Best Midwestern&#8221; colleges and universities, and one of the nation&#8217;s top &#8220;Green Colleges.&#8221; I&#8217;m incredibly proud that Mizzou is leading the way preparing Missourians to succeed in the modern economy. This week, the University of Missouri&#8217;s Chancellor Alexander Cartwright delivered encouraging news in the State of the University address. Among the recent University of Missouri positives highlighted: 1) MU researchers achieved a 23 percent increase for grant awards &#150; from $207 million in FY2018 to $255 million in FY2019; 2) Freshman enrollment grew by 31 percent over the last two years and a record-high retention rate of 87.9 percent; 3) Following graduation, approximately 90 percent of MU students say they have begun successful careers in their chosen fields.  MU&#8217;s value to Missouri and society in general is very evident. M-I-Z Z-O-U!    In more Columbia news, the Department of Veterans' Affairs ranked Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital in Columbia, Missouri No. 1 for \"Best Place to Work.\" The hospital has been at the forefront of optimizing patient-centered services to veterans in the area. I'm proud of all the staff at Truman VA!   D.C. Meeting Highlights Earlier this week I attended a trade hearing with Ambassador Gregg Doud, the lead agriculture negotiator in the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. At the briefing, we discussed our trade agreement with Japan and the progress of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).    The trade agreement with Japan is a big win for Missouri agriculture. Japan imports a half-billion dollars&#8217; worth of goods produced in Missouri and is the largest market in terms of value for U.S. pork exports. Missouri&#8217;s beef, poultry, and ethanol industries stand to make big gains with this new agreement. The USMCA will help propel Missouri agriculture throughout the American continent. The agreement will bring 176,000 new jobs to America and spur over $60 billion in new economic activity. I applaud President Trump and his team&#8217;s work on these agreements. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues and this administration to keep moving Missouri&#8217;s agriculture forward.  ____________________  On Friday, I met with&nbsp;U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Undersecretary Greg Ibach in my Washington, D.C. office. We discussed USDA&#8217;s ongoing investigation into beef pricing margins. This investigation began following the drastic market response that occurred after the August 9th meat packing plant fire in Holcomb, Kansas. This plant accounted for 6% of U.S. slaughter capacity, pushing through 6,000 head of cattle every day.    In the weeks following the fire, several of my cattle producers and sale barn owners in the district expressed concern over prices, reporting, and the market&#8217;s reaction in general. As a rancher himself, Undersecretary Ibach understood my constituents&#8217; concerns and is dedicated to having results from this investigation available for both those who view the market from an in-the-weeds point of view and those on the farm who may be wanting a more general summary.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I am committed to ensuring that all of our agriculture concerns from Missouri are represented in Washington. I look forward to updates from Undersecretary Ibach as the investigation moves forward and sharing those updates with our farmers and ranchers in the district.  Legislative Update  This week, Congressman John Garamendi (CA-3) and I introduced H.R. 4710, the Pharmaceutical Independent Long-Term Readiness Reform Act.  This bipartisan legislation requires the Department of Defense to identify the vulnerabilities faced by our country&#8217;s dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals, and to only purchase American-made raw materials, medicines, and vaccines for the military. Put simply, China having control over the production of our military&#8217;s medicine poses a grave national security threat. Not only does it open the possibility of them deliberately manipulating our servicemember&#8217;s medical regimens and cause physical harm, but the Chinese government&#8217;s lack of proper oversight and regulatory standards on prescription drugs is also deeply alarming to me. We need to ensure that our military&#8217;s medicine is American-made.  District Update CORRECTION: In last week&#8217;s newsletter, it said 18 Missouri counties had been designated disaster areas and qualified for federal assistance. The sentence should have said \"18 counties within Missouri&#8217;s 4th congressional district have received the designation.\"&nbsp; I am thankful 18 of Missouri 4th's 24 counties received this helpful designation so they can receive the needed funds.  Constituent Update   Our casework office handles a lot of the everyday issues affecting constituents throughout our district. For instance, we have done a lot of work with passport problems &#150; primarily helping to replace lost or stolen passports for constituents who are abroad or are heading to other countries. Passport problem solving is just one of the many issues that casework manager Janna Worsham handles on a regular basis. Feel free to give her a call at 573-442-9311 to see if she can help you. Weeks like these only reaffirm what we already know &#150; there is no place like Missouri&#8217;s 4th congressional district. It is such a high honor to represent all of you. I&#8217;m grateful for the opportunity to help keep moving our communities forward and humbled for the opportunity to represent you in the United States House of Representatives.

LEGISLATION 47TH DISTRICT ABOUT ALAN CONTACT ALAN &nbsp;                In This Edition  The White House is now making up its own rules about what it takes to start an impeachment. I was proud to vote this week to approve a House resolution condemning Turkish aggression against our Kurdish allies in Syria. Congress and the nation have lost a true public servant in the passing of iconic Congressman Elijah Cummings. I chaired a House subcommittee hearing this week to identify our nation&#8217;s pathways to a greener future. I joined in the passage this week of three bills aimed at supporting democracy in Hong Kong.  In District news, NASA is holding an essay contest for students to name its newest Mars rover. In the Inbox this edition, I share my response to constituents who wrote in concerned about offshore oil and gas drilling. And, Congress U this edition takes a look at what it means when a House Member votes &#8216;present,&#8217; instead of &#8216;yea&#8217; or &#8216;nay.&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to look at last week&#8217;s poll results, and make sure you take this week&#8217;s poll in the right-hand column.            CONNECT WITH ME              &nbsp;     Should the United States protect our Kurdish allies in Syria?  Yes   No   Maybe   Don't know/Unsure   &nbsp;If you have a problem, click here to open survey in a new window        &nbsp;  &nbsp;       Impeachment Inquiry Steadily Moves Forward  As the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence continues to depose Trump Administration officials, it is worth addressing the assertion by some, including the White House, that the House must hold a vote to legitimately begin an impeachment inquiry. This charge is simply not true, and critics of our inquiry are simply dissembling and inventing their own definition of the Constitution and House rules.  The Constitution gives the House the &#8220;&#133;sole Power of Impeachment.&#8221; However, the Constitution does not lay out the process for an impeachment in the House. It leaves that question to the House, which over the years has adopted rules to guide the impeachment process, including how an inquiry is initiated.  There is no requirement under the Constitution, no federal law, nor any House-adopted rule, that the whole House must vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry. Such a requirement simply does not exist.  This argument is just a further attempt by critics of our inquiry to inject chaos into the process and avoid accountability for the president&#8217;s wrongdoing. The Constitution makes clear that the impeachment process is run solely by the House and guided by the rules of the House--not the president and not by his lawyers. Condemning Turkish Aggression In Syria  In a single phone call to the president of Turkey, President Trump betrayed our allies, created the setting for a vast humanitarian disaster, injected chaos into an already unstable region, and diminished the standing of our nation on the international stage. His rash action in Syria has jeopardized our national security by empowering our enemies and risking the resurgence of ISIS.  I was proud to vote this week with 353 of my House colleagues from both sides of the aisle to condemn Turkish aggression against our Kurdish allies in Syria. This resolution &#8220;&#133;opposes the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria.\" While it is the duty of Congress to hold Turkey responsible for the atrocities they commit &#150; we cannot forget that this crisis began with, and falls squarely on the shoulders of, our own president.    The Passing of Elijah Cummings  I want to reflect on what to me is such a shock&#151;the passing of Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings. He was a giant here in Washington. A deeply respected man. He was a man of infinite character and moral composure who was a bastion of integrity for the entire Congress during even the most difficult of times. I always remember his frequent refrain in moments of crisis, &#8220;We can do better.&#8221;    So many leaders and icons like Elijah, from an era where understanding and compromise were so vital, are passing. I can&#8217;t think of this place without him&#151;a dynamic leader, a giant walking among us all. You can&#8217;t replace someone like Elijah Cummings. We are going to miss him for what he brought to Congress. I count myself honored to have known him not only as a colleague, but as someone I could call friend. This news has left me so very sad. Congress and our nation are diminished because of his passing. Finding A Pathway To Our Green Future  This week, as Chair of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, I led a critical hearing on Congressional efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Our planet is headed for irreparable damage if we don&#8217;t reduce greenhouse gas pollution and remove carbon from the atmosphere. This is not just an issue &#150; it is the issue.  During the hearing we heard from numerous witnesses, including California Air Resources Board member Hector De La Torre from Southern California. Hector spoke about how California was implementing its mandate to reach net-zero emission by 2045. Other witnesses also spoke about how states and the private sector are working towards lowering their greenhouse gas emissions to zero. We also discussed the role of additional research and development, and how land management practices can help make our public lands part of the climate change solution. There is no silver bullet that will save the day when it comes to climate change. Meeting the immense challenges ahead will require many kinds of solutions&#151;an &#8220;all-of-the-above&#8221; approach. We can, and we must, come together to address climate change in a way that is fair, that is equitable, and that creates new economic opportunities for our country. Not just for our health, not just for our economy, not just for our way of life. We are talking about our very future.    Supporting Democracy In Hong Kong  This week, three bills supporting democracy in Hong Kong passed the House with my support. I have met with pro-democracy Hong Kong citizens in the past when I visited Hong Kong and I support their cause. The U.S. must hold human rights violators accountable and stand up for people&#8217;s basic freedoms around the world. I believe these three bills are a strong step toward supporting democratic freedom in Hong Kong.    We have a long relationship with the people of Hong Kong and have stood with them unequivocally in the past. The passage of these bills is a clear signal to China that we continue to stand with the people of Hong Kong in their fight against oppression and their desire to uphold the concept of &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; which they are fearful of losing. We will support their desire to remain free. Protecting Birds and Their Habitat  I was proud to be asked this week to join a Capitol Hill panel put together by the National Audubon Society . Moderated by Audubon&#8217;s CEO David Yarnold, the panel also included my colleague Congressman Francis Rooney of Florida. We spoke to the audience about the increasing threat of climate change for global bird populations. Just weeks ago, a paper published in the journal Science showed that North America has lost nearly 30 percent of its bird population since 1970. That&#8217;s almost 3 billion birds in just under 50 years. Then, this last week, Audubon  showing that right now, 389 bird species are at risk of losing significant amounts of their habitat to climate change. I am leading several House bills to protect bird species, including the soon to be introduced Migratory Bird Protection Act which will push back against the Trump Administration&#8217;s efforts to strip century-old protections from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. I am also the co-lead of the Albatross and Petrel Conservation Act, which would expand cooperative opportunities with international partners to coordinate and combat threats to protect albatrosses and petrels.        Name The Next Mars Rover  NASA needs the help of kids throughout the nation. The space agency is inviting U.S. students to submit essays to name the Mars 2020 rover, NASA&#8217;s next rover mission to Mars. Kindergarten through 12th grade students have until&nbsp;Nov. 1, 2019&nbsp;to submit their essay on what to name the new rover. This is a long running tradition to have students name the Mars rovers. The Mars Curiosity rover (which has been on Mars since 2012), got its moniker about a decade ago from Clara Ma, then a Kansas sixth grader.&nbsp; The contest closes in just a couple weeks so please help spread the word. Click the link below to find out how to enter. Good luck to everyone who enters.          Hundreds of constituents contact my office each week to share their concerns and views on a variety of topics. I have recently received many messages from constituents on the topic of offshore drilling. Below is my response to those messages: &#8220;As you know, in January 2018, the Trump administration announced that their draft five-year oil and gas leasing plan allows drilling in the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Arctic.&nbsp; Like you, I strongly oppose opening our oceans to new offshore drilling.&nbsp; Californians do not want to put their coastal economies and these fragile ecosystems at risk.&nbsp;  As Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee&#8217;s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee, and chairman of the Safe Climate Caucus, I&#8217;m leading the fight against this misguided proposal.&nbsp; I co-authored the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act, which would prohibit the Department of the Interior from oil and gas leasing on the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic coasts. I led the floor debate for this bill, and I am proud that it passed the House of Representatives in September of 2019.&nbsp; The same day, we also passed the Protecting and Securing Florida&#8217;s Coastlines Act which would expand the ban on offshore drilling to the Gulf coast of Florida. Protecting and preserving our environment for future generations is one of my highest priorities as your Representative in Congress.&nbsp; I have worked tirelessly to advance legislation that protects our environment and to keep our U.S. Federal lands public unspoiled and available for all to enjoy.&nbsp; Certain uses of our public lands are incompatible with the long-term stewardship of these places.&nbsp; Rest assured that I will continue to fight to protect our environment and public lands for future generations.&#8221;  If you have written in to me, please continue to do so. If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about.  You can find out how to contact me on my website by        Voting &#8220;Present&#8221; In The House  The House resolution pushing back against Turkish aggression against our allies the Kurds was passed by a vote of 354-60 earlier this week. However, four Members voted &#8216;present&#8217; instead of &#8216;yea&#8217; or &#8216;nay.&#8217;  What is a &#8216;present&#8217; vote?  When a bill is being considered on the House Floor, Members of Congress vote via electronic recording consoles located at various places on the House floor. These consoles have three voting options: YEA, NAY, and PRES. In this case, &#8220;PRES&#8221; means &#8220;present&#8221; (the blue &#8216;open&#8217; light stays lit to indicate Members can still vote on the legislation under consideration).    Voting present is a refusal to take a side on a particular vote, and it does not count towards or against the final passage of a bill. In rare instances, House Members of one party vote &#8216;present&#8217; as a group in order to showcase the views of the opposing party to the general public or protest the topic of the vote. &nbsp;However, these instances are rare, and while voting &#8216;present&#8217; is always an option it is rarely used by large numbers of Members on any given vote. As for me, personally, I have almost never used the &#8216;present&#8217; option, preferring instead to have my votes, either &#8220;yea&#8221; or &#8220;nay,&#8221; on the record for my constituents to see.

As I said on Thursday, none of this is normal. None of this is ethical. None of this is moral.&nbsp;  In relation to the Middle East, as you likely&nbsp;know, earlier this month, President Trump made the decision to remove U.S. troops from the border of Turkey and Syria, which gave Turkey the green light to invade Syria and&nbsp;attack&nbsp;our allies, the Kurds.&nbsp;The Kurds have been critical partners in the U.S.&#8217;s fight against ISIS and &#150; up until the Turkish invasion &#150; had been successfully holding members of ISIS in prison. Due to the President&#8217;s&nbsp;reckless decision to remove troops from this region, we have betrayed our allies. And&nbsp;hundreds of ISIS fighters have now escaped.  On Thursday of this week, the Trump Administration announced a so-called &#8220;ceasefire&#8221; in Syria that is contingent upon Kurds retreating from the land that Turkey has been attacking since President Trump ordered the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. troops.  What this &#8220;ceasefire&#8221;&nbsp;amounts to&nbsp;is&nbsp;a capitulation to Turkey at the expense of our Kurdish allies. The agreement lets Turkey off the hook for slaughtering innocent civilians and the Kurdish troops who fought alongside American soldiers against ISIS. Moreover, it does nothing to address the need to&nbsp;recapture the ISIS soldiers who have already escaped from Kurdish-held prisons.&nbsp;  The progression of these events is deeply disturbing. This week, in response to Turkish aggression, I joined with Republican and Democratic Senators to introduce a bill to levy strong sanctions against Turkey. Keeping our homeland safe is the number one duty of government. The president&#8217;s impulsive series of decisions have strengthened ISIS, strengthened Turkey and Russia, and greatly undermined the trust that is so critical in forging alliances that protect our security and standing in the world. I will continue to speak out against these, and any other actions, that put our nation at risk.  With every good wish,&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On  Fighting for New Hampshire  This week, Senator Hassan introduced bicameral legislation to support innovative competency-based education programs that allow college and university students the flexibility to balance their studies with work and family obligations, as well as the opportunity for accelerated learning that can save students time and money. Learn more here. Senator Hassan also wrote an op-ed for the Nashua Telegraph where she addressed the high cost of housing in New Hampshire and legislation she is working on to help landlords and tenants avoid evictions and incentivize more affordable housing. Read the Senator&#8217;s op-ed here. With increasingly frequent ransomware attacks on state and local governments, Senator Hassan is calling on the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review how the federal government is assisting state and local governments in bolstering their cybersecurity. As New Hampshire saw firsthand earlier this year in Strafford County, cyberattacks pose a real and growing threat.

This is a top priority for me and&nbsp;Democratic leadership, and I assure you that we will leave no stone unturned in this thorough yet expeditious process.  The&nbsp;pace of these developments and other pressing issues that impact all of us can seem overwhelming, which is&nbsp;why it's more important than ever that we remain abreast of the issues. When&nbsp;we&nbsp;are informed of the facts,&nbsp;we are better able to push back&nbsp;against&nbsp;personally and politically motivated distortions, distractions,&nbsp;and lies. Even more importantly,&nbsp;remaining informed helps us create positive change.  One of the things that we can do is check the accuracy of the claims made by those who wish to retain power and use the chaos of this Administration to&nbsp;benefit their own agendas. There are many news websites that provide this service, including The Washington Post's online Fact Checker, AP Fact Check,&nbsp;Snopes,&nbsp;Media Matters for America, and FactCheck.org.  And that is why I am sharing&nbsp;this edition of Jackie's Reading Picks with you, a collection of editorials and articles that piqued my interest over the past week.

Fact-Checking 5 Claims About the Impeachment Inquiry President Trump and his defenders have inaccurately attacked the impeachment inquiry for what they say are procedural and constitutional violations, a faulty premise and a lack of support. By Linda Qiu, The New York Times      &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;       What Was Said  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;In the 240-plus years of our history, those rare times where we have had impeachment process, it&#8217;s always gone through the House Judiciary Committee, because the House Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction over the Constitution and over impeachment. It&#8217;s not the Intelligence Committee.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#151; Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, in an interview this month False.  In her announcement last month initiating formal impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had directed six committees &#151; including the Intelligence Committee, whose chairman, Adam B. Schiff of California, has drawn Mr. Trump&#8217;s ire &#151; to proceed with investigations under &#8220;that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.&#8221; Behind closed doors, she said the committees should forward their cases on potentially impeachable offenses by Mr. Trump to the Judiciary Committee. This arrangement, according to Mr. Ratcliffe, amounts to a jurisdictional violation. But while impeachment inquiries have been typically conducted by the House Judiciary Committee since its formation in 1813, there is no rule mandating it and there is precedent for other committees taking the lead. Special committees began impeachment inquiries against federal judges in 1804, 1808 and 1839. And in 1867, after the Judiciary Committee voted to not send articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson to the full House, a second attempt to impeach him succeeded after an inquiry by the Committee on Reconstruction.

He Couldn&#8217;t Help Himself.      &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;      Humiliating his own Cabinet secretaries was bad. Putting faithful American allies in harm&#8217;s way is far worse. By Peter Wehner, contributing writer at The Atlantic and senior fellow at EPPC President Donald Trump&#8217;s betrayal of the Kurdish forces played a central role in aiding the United States in fighting the Islamic State. But in a phone call a week ago Sunday, Trump gave the green light to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an to invade northern Syria&#151;and, in the process, to engage in what even one of Trump&#8217;s most loyal supporters, Senator Lindsey Graham, describes as the &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; of the Kurds. According to Jennifer Griffin and Melissa Leon of Fox News, Trump was supposed to tell Erdo&#287;an to stay north of the border, but instead &#8220;went off script.&#8221; By Wednesday, the Turkish offensive began, with Erdo&#287;an&#8217;s aim to push back the Syrian Kurds from the border region. The results have been swift and brutal: the displacement of more than 100,000 people, executions and war crimes, the escape of hundreds of Islamic State prisoners. (If Islamic State fighters escape, they&#8217;ll &#8220;be escaping to Europe,&#8221; Trump said last week&#151;as if Europe&#8217;s problems don&#8217;t affect the United States.) For the Kurds, the consequences of America&#8217;s policy change will only get worse. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many people will die. A lot of people will die,&#8221; a senior military source told Fox News. Yesterday the Trump administration tried frantically to make Turkey stand down, but enormous damage has already been done.

By Siobh&#225;n O'Grady and Miriam Berger, The Washington Post  And in case its name doesn&#8217;t make this clear, it&#8217;s owned by President Trump. On Thursday, the White House announced that Trump&#8217;s Miami hotel would host next year&#8217;s Group of Seven summit &#151; in a move watchdog groups are expected to quickly scrutinize as a conflict of interest because of the president&#8217;s opportunity to profit off the event, which will draw leaders from some of the world&#8217;s biggest economies, as well as their large entourages, journalists and security. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that the Trump administration considered 10 sites as potential venues for the meetings and determined &#8220;Doral was far away the best physical facility for this meeting.&#8221; In recent years, American presidents have hosted such summits at Camp David, a government-owned presidential retreat in Maryland, and at the Sea Island Resort in Georgia. (The G-7 was known as the G-8 until 2014, when Russia stopped participating in its meetings.) Member countries take turns serving as the group&#8217;s rotating president and thus hosting the group&#8217;s meetings each year. Here&#8217;s where others have recently chosen to host the high-security event. To read the compelte Washington Post article, please click here.            She was one of Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s victims. Now, her name is on a crime bill in Congress By Julie K. Brown, The Miami Herald For 10 years, Courtney Wild waged almost a one-woman crusade against the federal government  Some of that time, Wild pursued justice from a putrid Florida state prison cell, where she was serving a longer sentence for a drug crime than Epstein, who received a plea deal that allowed him to enjoy his 13-month jail term mostly from the comforts of his luxurious office in West Palm Beach. But a decade later, Wild&#8217;s relentless quest has led to a bipartisan push in Congress for sweeping reforms that, among other things, would give judges the power to nullify plea deals that violate the Crime Victims&#8217; Rights Act (CVRA). The Courtney Wild Crime Victims&#8217; Rights Reform Act of 2019 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives Thursday by Reps. Jackie Speier, D-Calif.; Scott Perry, R&#8209;Pa.; Lois Frankel, D&#8209;Fla.; and Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and is co-sponsored by nine other representatives from both parties.

Nadler speaks with students following the House passage of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, in February. This summer, the communities of El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio were devastated by senseless mass shootings. They marked the 249th and 250th mass shooting in 2019 alone, putting our nation on a pace of more than one mass shooting a day on average, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. Words in the face of these tragedies are never enough- Congress must act! That is why, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I immediately held a markup on three lifesaving gun safety bills following these tragedies: the Keep Americans Safe Act, the Disarm Hate Act, and the Extreme Risk Order Protection Act. These bills would ban high capacity ammunition magazines, prohibit individuals convicted of violence misdemeanor hate crimes from possessing a firearm, and help states implement extreme risk order protection laws to prevent those who are a risk to themselves or others from accessing a firearm. Unfortunately, the Majority in the Senate remains steadfast in their opposition to even voting on the most commonsense gun safety bills. Over 200 days ago, the House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Backgrounds Check Act, which would expand background checks to all gun sales. According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, nearly 90% of Americans support expanding background checks, yet the Senate Majority Leader has not called for a single vote on any gun safety bill. This is a reckless way to govern and puts countless lives at risk. It is past time for the Senate and the President to act on H.R. 8, and the numerous other gun safety measures working their way through the House, to prevent gun violence. We owe it to the victims of gun violence and the American people to end this epidemic once and for all. Fighting the Public Housing Crisis in NYC & Nationwide In New York City, federal disinvestment in public housing has led to crumbling buildings and unnecessary hardship for tenants. In my view, individuals in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) face immoral conditions- collapsing ceilings, years-long leaks, and broken elevators- that would have resulted in any private landlord having their property seized. This is a crisis that can no longer go ignored. That is why I joined Congresswoman Nydia Velzquez to author the Public Housing Emergency Response Act, which would allocate $70 billion for public housing repairs nationwide. Under our proposal, $32 billion would go to NYCHA to ensure our residents have access to affordable housing that wont jeopardize their health. Safe, affordable housing is a basic right for every American, and I believe it is past time for the federal government to step up to the plate and ensure quality housing for all.

Nadler speaking in support of the Green New Deal at a climate change press conference in Washington, D.C. Last month, I wrote an op-ed in The Villager calling on Congress and the Administration to address the emergency of climate change and to improve our nation's climate resilience. Climate change is real and threatens all of us, regardless of nationality, political party, or economic status. The House Majority has put forward bold proposals to combat this crisis, including the Green New Deal, but the Senate Majority has not voted on any climate change legislation. For the sake of future generations, we need drastic action to affect change, and the federal government must move quickly to tackle the climate crisis head-on.

With our current transportation infrastructure entrenched as one of the largest sources of carbon emissions, it is critical that we support multi-modal transportation options like cycling, rapid speed transit, and walking.  I&#8217;m proud to announce that I, in partnership with my colleagues Congressman Jes&#250;s &#8220;Chuy&#8221; Garc&#237;a (D-CA), and Congressman Mark Takano (D-CA), launched the Future of Transportation Caucus &#150; a new congressional caucus dedicated to creating a vision for the future of our transportation system that emphasizes equity, access, and sustainability.        I'm proud to launch this caucus alongside my colleagues Chuy Garc&#237;a from Illinois and Mark Takano from California.    &nbsp;        I was so grateful to have the 7th represented at our launch event with representatives from groups including LivableStreets Alliance, Green Roots, Transportation for Massachusetts, and the Boston Cyclists Union.    #DidYouKnow: In our district, the four neighborhoods with the longest commute times also have the largest populations of low-income residents. In fact, Black bus riders in the Boston metro area spend 66 more hours per year waiting, riding and transferring buses than white bus riders. These disparities obstruct economic mobility and create unnecessary barriers to success: barriers for the high school student trying to get to class, for the senior trying to get to a doctor&#8217;s appointment, for the hourly wage worker trying to get to their job. At our launch, I was joined by transit justice advocates from our district including LivableStreets Alliance, Green Roots, Transportation for Massachusetts, and the Boston Cyclists Union and others.  Without the partnership of advocates and activists like you, none of this work would be possible.&nbsp;        Earlier this month, I convened transit experts and advocates to discuss how we can affirm transit equity in the 7th district and across the country.      Earlier this month during our district work period, I convened transit experts and advocates for a roundtable discussion on what we can do to reimagine our transportation systems and affirm transit equity in the 7th district and across the country. The thoughtful insights and innovative ideas shared at the roundtable will inform the caucus&#8217;s agenda as we lay out the vision for the future of transportation in our communities.  The Future of Transportation Caucus will bring together experts, activists and policy makers to advance federal transportation and infrastructure policies that prioritize community connectivity and promote transportation justice so every community has access to the critical housing, education, employment and health services necessary to thrive.        Without the support and partnership of advocates and activists like you, none of this work would be possible.     Our caucus is already at a robust 21 members, including Reps. Hank Johnson (D-GA), Joe Morelle (D-NY), Jared Huffman (D-CA), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Sharice Davids (D-KS), Steve Cohen (D-TN), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Seth Moulton (D-MA), Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Andre Carson (D-IN), Donna Shalala (D-FL), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), and Gil Cisneros (D-CA). I&#8217;m excited about this opportunity to reimagine our federal transportation policy together, and I look forward to partnering with many of you to ensure that we are building a roadmap for how our transit system can stop perpetuating disparities and reverse them for good. Stay tuned for updates from the caucus and ways to get involved in the 7th!

President Erdogan has given up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything.&nbsp; The Turks have stated that &#8216;this is not a ceasefire,&#8217; and made clear that they &#8216;will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave&#8217; &#150; referring to the courageous Kurdish fighters who have suffered nearly 11,000 casualties in our fight to defeat ISIS.&nbsp; This agreement also does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS prisoners from escaping, and shows the President&#8217;s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.&nbsp; To say that Turkey and Syria will guard the prisoners is outrageous and puts our homeland security at risk.&nbsp; ISIS is still a threat, certainly now more than before the President gave Erdogan the green light to invade Syria.  &nbsp;   Congresswoman Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attend a meeting at the White House to discuss Syria. &nbsp;  The&nbsp;President&nbsp;unleashed a further escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria that has left dozens of innocent civilians dead, displaced hundreds of thousands more and invited the resurgence of ISIS.&nbsp; The only beneficiaries of the President&#8217;s policies are our adversaries: ISIS, Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin and Iran.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s decision further makes the argument that the President doesn&#8217;t see Putin as the danger he is to our country.&nbsp;  Yesterday&#8217;s overwhelming bipartisan vote of 354-60 in the House to oppose the President&#8217;s decision and demand a clear ISIS strategy yesterday was an important step, and the Senate should do the same immediately.&nbsp; Next week, the House will pass a strong, bipartisan sanctions package to work to reverse the humanitarian disaster that&nbsp;the President&nbsp;unleashed in Syria.&nbsp; Our servicemembers, our allies and our partners all suffering from the Syrian conflict deserve smart, strong and sane leadership from Washington.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;     A constituent&#8217;s family contacted my office because he was victim of a crime abroad and the family had difficulty reaching the constituent.

A 19-year-old with the 89th infantry division, Pfc. Raymond Vick mailed his final letter to his family in Nash County on March 26, 1945. He was killed in action that same day. Brady now lives in West End, where she keeps a collection of artifacts from her brother's short life. She has wanted for years to find a pair of military decorations awarded to Vick after his death. Following a conversation with Brady, U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson offered to have his staff track down Vick's missing World War II Victory Medal, along with the late infantryman's lapel pin for honorable service. The decorations had been lost for nearly 75 years. [image = Rep. Richard Hudson (NC-08) presents the lost WWII medal to Jean Brady at American Legion Post No. 12 in Carthage. Last week, one of Hudson's aides contacted Brady with good news. \"When his office called and told me they had (my brother's) medal, I was so excited I was bouncing off the wall,\" Brady said. Hudson presented the recovered awards to Brady during a brief ceremony Monday in front of American Legion Post No. 12 in Carthage. Hudson said his staff had to clear \"a lot of red tape\" to obtain the decorations, but the process itself was \"not tremendously hard.\" [image = Rep. Hudson presents Mrs. Brady with Pfc.

Vick, Mrs. Brady's brother who was KIA in WWII. Hudson said ceremonies like the one held in Carthage are \"important because we're losing so many of our World War II veterans every day.\" \"Our younger generation needs to hear those stories,\" he said. \"They need to know who these men were and what they did, and that's why I made a special effort today to be here and do this.\" ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":4.24117},{"name":"Congressman Richard Hudson","address":"richard.hudson@congressnewsletter.net","timestamp":"2019-10-13","subject":"We're all getting older","body":"Congressman Richard Hudson, 8th District of North Carolina *Friends, * *We are all getting older. *There are no ifs, ands or buts about it. People say with age comes more wisdom and more kindness - and a lot of wrinkles and grey hair.* As the stories we tell our kids get longer and longer, our memories get shorter and shorter. *But as a famous American architect once said, \"The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes.\" *Every day, I make it a top priority to ensure our nation's elderly and veterans are cared for.* I have worked tirelessly to protect Social Security and Medicare for our current seniors while strengthening it for future generations. I've worked to lower drug costs at the pharmacy counter and I am committed to ensuring you can access affordable, high-quality health care. *I have consistently been recognized as a \"Guardian of Seniors' Rights\" by leading seniors' groups for my work to keep our promises to today's seniors and future generations while cutting wasteful government spending.* I continue to fight for reforms to save your tax dollars over the long term and pave the way for a Medicare system that promotes higher quality care for seniors while strengthening the doctor-patient relationship. Last year, I was proud to support the *Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2017* (H.R. 4547) to improve protections for the millions of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on a representative payee to administer their monthly benefits. *President Donald Trump signed the bill into law, and we've made good progress, but there is still much more work to do.* I'm glad to see this Administration continue to put caring for our nation's seniors at the top of the to-do list. [image = President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order to strengthen Medicare. *On October 3, President Trump doubled down on that commitment by issuing an executive order to protect and improve Medicare for our nation's seniors. *In his announcement, President Trump said he will continue to build on aspects of the program that work well, including the market-based approaches in the current system. The executive order will allow seniors more choices to pick a plan that fits their needs. Additionally, it will eliminate excessive billing requirements and allow doctors to spend more time with patients. *By doing this, we will help empower patients to select and access the right care, at the right time, in the right place, from the right provider.* As a nation, another promise we've made is to honor the service and sacrifice of our nation's service members.* Last week I was fortunate enough to honor a World War II soldier and present his sister the awards he earned in service. *Private First Class (PFC) Raymond Vick was killed in action in Worms, Germany during WWII when his sister, Jean Brady, was just 8 years old. I was able to track down his WWII Victory Medal and the WWII Honorable Service Lapel Pin after they were lost for 74 years. [image = Presenting PFC Vick's WWII medal to his sister, Jean. *The ceremony took place in Carthage where I was blessed with the opportunity to present these awards to his sister. *PFC Vick was born in Nash County in November 1924. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943 in the Infantry. He served in General George Patton's 3rd Army as a member of A company, 355th Infantry Regiment, 89th Infantry Division. He was only 21 years old at the time of his death on March 26, 1945. *As your Congressman, I stand ready to ensure our country keeps the promises made to senior citizens and veterans.* *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* [image = [link 1] [image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] [image = [link 6] [image = [link 7] [image = [link 8] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":3.955883},{"name":"Congressman Steve Cohen","address":"tn09ima@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-10-11","subject":"The Latest News from Congressman Steve Cohen","body":"  /* Client-specific Styles */ body { width: 100% !important; margin: 0px;} .ReadMsgBody { width: 100%; } .ExternalClass { width: 100%; display:block !important; } /* Force Hotmail to display emails at full width */ /* Reset Styles */ body { margin:0; padding: 0; } img { outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width :100%;} br, strong br, b br, em br, i br { line-height: 100%; } h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { line-height: 100% !important; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; } /*ly, tr#221562, add same margin as margin-block-start/end*/ h1{margin-top:0.67em;margin-bottom:0.67em;} h2{margin-top:0.83em;margin-bottom:0.83em;} h3{margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;} h4{margin-top:1.33em;margin-bottom:1.33em;} h5{margin-top:1.67em;margin-bottom:1.67em;} h6{margin-top:2.33em;margin-bottom:2.33em;} table td, table tr { border-collapse: collapse; } p { margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }     p { margin-bottom:1em }          News from&nbsp;Congressman Steve Cohen                             Website | Serving You | Legislative Work | Our District | Resources               October 11, 2019  &nbsp;    Dear Friend,&nbsp;This week, I applauded the decision to hold a public hearing in Memphis on the bad idea to block grant Tennessee&#8217;s Medicaid program.&nbsp;TennCare&nbsp;did not originally schedule a hearing in our city, despite the disproportionate&nbsp;impact this proposed change would have on Memphians.&nbsp;I also called attention to a roundtable discussion on &#8220;Complete Streets&#8221; I have scheduled for October 25 to discuss pedestrian, bicyclist and transit users&#8217; safety; expressed concern at the Trump Administration&#8217;s stonewalling of legitimate oversight of its clearly impeachable conduct; condemned Trump&#8217;s&nbsp;dangerous&nbsp;decision to allow Turkey to invade parts of Syria held by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias; addressed Mr.&nbsp;Rakestraw&#8217;s&nbsp;A.P.

Shelby County&nbsp;has more than ten times the number of beneficiaries as Madison County, the only county in West Tennessee originally scheduled for a public hearing. I&nbsp;also wrote an&nbsp;op-ed&nbsp;for The Commercial Appeal. I&nbsp;am pleased to see&nbsp;a hearing has been planned for Tuesday, October 15, at 1:30 p.m. at the University Center Ballroom, 499 University Street. Memphians deserve to be heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal would allow the state government to arbitrarily change&nbsp;TennCare&nbsp;coverage and slash benefits for those who need them most. I hope the hearing&nbsp;is&nbsp;well-attended and expect it to produce the overwhelmingly negative response it has already received at hearings in Knoxville, Nashville and Jackson.&nbsp;  Holding a Complete Streets Roundtable October 25&nbsp;    Congressman Cohen speaking at People for Bikes Workshop Thursday  It is an unpleasant fact that Memphis has a reputation as one of the most dangerous&nbsp;cities&nbsp;for pedestrians, bicyclists and users of public transit. That&#8217;s why I introduced&nbsp;H.R. 3663, the Complete Streets Act.&nbsp;This bill would create a program to pay for technical assistance and provide capital grants for projects such as sidewalks, bike lanes and bus stops to improve the safety and efficiency of transit. I am hosting a Complete Streets roundtable discussion on October 25 in Memphis to hear ideas from private sector stakeholders and our local, state and federal government on how to produce safer Complete Streets.&nbsp;On Thursday, I attended a City of Memphis and People for Bikes workshop at which protected bike lane proponents, such as keynote speaker Charles T. Brown of Rutgers University, spoke of transportation equity and the need to prioritize the interests of pedestrians and bicyclists after decades of prioritizing&nbsp;moving as many&nbsp;cars as possible through our streets.  Expressing Concern at Trump Administration Stonewalling of Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry&nbsp;  Just as Trump has repeatedly stonewalled the House Judiciary Committee throughout the 116th&nbsp;Congress, he is now obstructing the House&#8217;s impeachment inquiry into his attempts to pressure foreign governments to dig up dirt on his political opponents.&nbsp;The American people deserve answers and it is essential we stand up to this&nbsp;President&#8217;s reckless and impeachable behavior. See my interview about the ongoing stonewalling with CNN&#8217;s&nbsp;Bianna&nbsp;Keilar&nbsp;here and with CNN&#8217;s Jim Sciutto here.  Condemning Trump&#8217;s&nbsp;Irresponsible&nbsp;&#8220;Green Light&#8221; to Turkey&#8217;s Invasion of Syria&nbsp;  I am deeply disappointed in the President&#8217;s knee-jerk and irresponsible decision to give Turkey the green light to invade parts of northeastern Syria currently occupied by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias. There has been a bipartisan chorus from lawmakers and foreign policy experts condemning the President&#8217;s decision to abandon an important ally. I am also very concerned about what message this abandonment sends to our other allies.&nbsp;I dread the humanitarian disaster that likely comes next.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Addressing Mr.&nbsp;Rakestraw&#8217;s&nbsp;White Station&nbsp;High&nbsp;School&nbsp;A.P. Government Class&nbsp;  &nbsp;On Tuesday, I met with students in teacher Curt&nbsp;Rakestraw&#8217;s&nbsp;Advanced Placement&nbsp;Government class at White Station High School to talk about what I&#8217;m doing in Congress and to take thoughtful questions from students. Mr.&nbsp;Rakestraw&nbsp;is clearly a great teacher and his&nbsp;engaging&nbsp;students&nbsp;are a testament to his hard work.&nbsp;It was an honor to meet with them.&nbsp;  Talking to&nbsp;Career and&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Education Students at Cordova High&nbsp;School&nbsp;  &nbsp;On Thursday, I met with more than 650 juniors and seniors in various Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs at Cordova High School about&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs.&nbsp;As a member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, I have supported legislation to expand access to these essential programs.&nbsp;Just last month, the House passed the STEM Opportunities Act to remove barriers for minority students in STEM fields. It is essential that our best and brightest have to opportunity to conduct research and improve technology to make us all safer, healthier and better prepared to meet the challenges ahead. I want to thank Principal Barton Thorne, teacher Ariane&nbsp;Kavass&nbsp;and the entire &#8220;Wolfpack&#8221; for inviting me.  Speaking Out Against Gun Violence at a &#8220;Moms Demand Action&#8221; Event&nbsp;&nbsp;    On Thursday, I joined &#8220;Moms Demand Action&#8221; volunteers to speak out against senseless gun violence.&nbsp;The Judiciary Committee on which I serve as a senior member has passed a red flag law and limits on high-capacity magazines while the whole House has passed a bipartisan universal background checks bill and a bill closing the Charleston loophole. Unfortunately,&nbsp;these measures&nbsp;remain&nbsp;bottled up&nbsp;by&nbsp;Senate&nbsp;Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who cares more about the NRA than the safety of our communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Offering 2020 U.S. Historical Society Calendars&nbsp;   My office will have a limited number of 2020 U.S. Capitol Historical Society calendars available.

The actions by President Erdo&#287;an and the Turkish forces has brought increased violence and instability to a vitally important region. That is why I am co-sponsoring Congresswoman Liz Cheney's bill to increase sanctions on Turkey in response to their invasion of Syria. I was also asked about hemp farming and what can be done to help foster its growth here in Virginia.&nbsp; I was proud to say that I lead the delegation in sending a letter to the USDA to have Virginia included as a one of the states where hemp growers will now be eligible to receive crop insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am grateful for everyone who was able to make it to the town hall.

Your concerns are my highest priority when developing policies that seek to meet the needs of the district. It is undeniable that the effects of climate change are felt by communities throughout the world. Major hurricanes, including Harvey and Dorian, are representative of the impact climate change has had in the United States. Additionally, wild fires on the west coast threaten the safety of Americans. Reading through your concerns, I am reminded of Congress&#8217;s need to act swiftly on the effects of climate change because our actions will determine the future of the world. The House passed H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, which aims to keep the United States in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. This is the first time in the past decade that a climate bill has made it through the House. However, our efforts to limit the impact of climate change must continue. I am taking prudent steps to mitigate the impacts experienced by communities most at risk.&nbsp; Throughout past sessions, I have fought to pass bills that seek to protect the environment and increase funding for research. Congress passed bills I have authored including H.R. 1157, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2008, which made grants to conduct collaborative multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research on environmental factors that may be related to the etiology of breast cancer, and H.R. 2494, the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016, which addresses wildlife trafficking, which is the poaching or other illegal taking of protected or managed species and the illegal trade in wildlife and their related parts and products. Moving forward, I am driven to promote reforestation efforts and develop green spaces in urban areas that will not create problematic impacts on these communities. Addressing the effects of climate change are not actions that should solely be taken by Congress. State and local governments must hold themselves accountable to ensure we are limiting these effects. The City of Houston has taken ambitious steps through the Climate Action Plan. It provides evidenced-based measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preventative measures to address the negative outcomes of climate change. The plan will demonstrate how the City will adapt and improve its resilience to climate hazards that impact the city today as well as risks that may increase in the coming years. To comply with the Paris Climate Accord, Houston&#8217;s plan will follow science-based criteria that will cap the temperature increases associated with climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists believe that preventing global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius will avert the worst consequences of climate change. This plan will create ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and establish a pathway to meet the Paris Agreement goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. After three major floods with the largest rain event in North American history, climate change is an unprecedented challenge for Houston. Sustainability and resiliency go hand-in-hand and this plan is essential to the health and economic vitality of Houston&#8217;s future. Developing a Climate Action Plan allows the City to develop strategies that will not only help minimize the City&#8217;s carbon footprint but can help save money and improve the quality of life of residents. The benefits associated with climate action planning include decreased traffic and congestion, improved air quality, better access to parks and green spaces, and cost savings through energy efficiency projects.  The effects of climate change are strongly related to economic, public health, and economic issues. Congress should address these issues for the safety of future generations. As the energy capital of the world, Houston must develop bold strategies to implement sustainable energy efforts. In the current session, I have cosponsored five bills related to limiting the impacts of climate change. These bills include H.R. 1429, the Drinking Water Infrastructure for Job Creation Act; H.R. 2748, the SAFE Act Safeguarding America's Future and Environment Act; H.R. 852, the Get the Lead Out of Schools Act; H.R. 1337, Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2019; and H.R. 1137, the Environmental Health Workforce Act of 2019. These are initial but monumental steps I&nbsp;have taken&nbsp;to ensure that your concerns as residents of the 18th Congressional District are addressed. I will continue to consider climate bills as they move through the legislative process, including H.R. 763. Your input is vital&nbsp;to ensure&nbsp;that we&nbsp;hold&nbsp;government entities accountable in responding to the effects of climate change.

Working to Support Kansas Law Enforcement Inviting Attorney General William Barr to Kansas On Wednesday, I hosted Attorney General William Barr to tour key facilities in Topeka and Wichita and to meet with state and local law enforcement. In Topeka, we visited the Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation&#8217;s Forensic Science Center. Both facilities work in partnership with agencies and jurisdictions throughout Kansas, and we heard an update on their work to assist law enforcement in solving and fighting crime in every corner of the state.   In Wichita we joined staff of the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office to discuss ongoing partnerships to fight and prosecute crime and met with folks at Wichita State University engaged in work between the university&#8217;s Law Enforcement Training Center and the ATF. Both components in Topeka and Wichita are vital to Kansans and to the professionals who work to protect our communities. Most importantly, in both Topeka and Wichita, we spent time with law enforcement officials to hear firsthand how we can best support them at the federal level.   As the chief appropriator of the Department of Justice, I&#8217;m committed to working with Attorney General Barr to make certain our law enforcement personnel have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep communities safe across Kansas and the country. An essential part of keeping our communities safe is creating partnerships between federal, state and local law enforcement to accomplish their mission.   I&#8217;m proud of the work we&#8217;ve seen from all across the state to increase collaboration for the safety and well-being of Kansans. Attorney General Barr has a deep appreciation for our men and women in uniform, and I thank him for meeting with Kansas law enforcement during his time in our state.

Announcing the Reopening of DEA&#8217;s Garden City Office On Monday morning I joined officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the Garden City Police Department to announce the reopening of the Garden City DEA field office. The reopening of this office will enhance efforts by local law enforcement to get drugs off the streets and stop the flow of contraband to the rest of the country. Since its closure in 2017, we&#8217;ve worked to demonstrate the region&#8217;s need for this office, and through my role as the chief appropriator for the DEA, I&#8217;ve worked to make certain there are the necessary resources to complete the reopening. I look forward to seeing the many benefits this office will provide to Southwest Kansas and the entire state. To read more from the&nbsp;Garden City Telegram&nbsp;on this reopening and what it means for the region, click&nbsp;here.   Speaking on the Legacy of President John Bardo at Wichita State On Friday evening, I joined Wichita State University officials and Wichita community leaders to honor the legacy of Dr. John Bardo in the official renaming ceremony of the Experiential Engineering Building to the John Bardo Center. As President of Wichita State University, Dr. Bardo led a period of unprecedented growth for the school that spread to the community and the entire region. During my remarks, I noted the significant impact throughout the Wichita State community by Dr. Bardo and expressed my deep gratitude for his service to Wichita.   Autism CARES Act Signed Into Law This week, the president signed the&nbsp;Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support,&nbsp;or the&nbsp;CARES Act,&nbsp;into law. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation that is the strongest-ever package of federal support for research, services and training for the autism community. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism impacts an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States, and often comes with lifelong health and quality of life challenges. Additional research funding in this legislation will improve our understanding of autism through research at the National Institutes of Health, the CDC and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Ultimately, through these important investments, we will be able to better care for this unique and vibrant community. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read more on the&nbsp;CARES Act. Celebrating Spirit AeroSystem&#8217;s Partnership with Wichita State On Friday, I attended the grand opening of the Spirit AeroSystems Research Collaboration Center which is housed at the Wichita State University (WSU) Innovation Campus. The center establishes a unique partnership between Spirit and the university through the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) and WSU Tech. This partnership will accelerate and enhance Spirit&#8217;s research and development objectives as well as applied learning opportunities that better prepare students for the aviation and aerospace industries. As co-chair of the Senate Aerospace Caucus and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I look forward to working further with these two exceptional organizations to further solidify Wichita&#8217;s place as the Air Capital of the World. Congratulations to all those who made this special occasion possible, and special thanks to Spirit CEO Tom Gentile and WSU Vice President for Research and Technology John Tomblin for their leadership.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Watching the K-State Game On Saturday, I was at Bill Snyder Family Stadium in Manhattan to watch K-State play the Baylor Bears. This week&#8217;s game was &#8220;Fort Riley Day&#8221; and honored the men and women who serve in the 1st Infantry Division and at Fort Riley. The K-State Marching Band paid tribute to those serving our military around the world with a halftime performance that included the military anthems for each branch of the armed forces. During the game, I had the opportunity to visit with good friends Van Witthuhn, Eldon Stoecklein, Pat Parke, Carolyn States and Carol and Eric Hartman. EMAW!   Hosting Kansas Listening Tour Stops Seward County On Monday, I was in Liberal for a stop on my Kansas Listening Tour. During this townhall meeting, I discussed a number of items with folks from Seward County including my work to increase veterans&#8217; access to healthcare through the VA MISSION Act, the need for Congress to pass USMCA, the current farm economy, crop insurance, immigration reform, access to mental healthcare, the need for updated infrastructure, rural broadband and gun violence. Thank you to all those who attended for their productive conversation, and to the Liberal Lions Club for their hospitality.   Meade County On Monday afternoon, I hosted a Kansas Listening Tour stop in Meade County. During this stop, local residents and I discussed a number of issues including healthcare in rural communities, veterans&#8217; access to care, agriculture and the need to pass USMCA for farmers and ranchers, immigration, gun violence, rural broadband and my work to make certain rural America can thrive. Thanks to those from across Meade County for taking time to share their thoughts and ideas with me on Monday. Visiting with Impressive Kansas Students Plains Elementary School Prior to my Meade County Listening Tour stop, I joined students and staff of Plains Elementary School. A special thank you to Plains Elementary School 5th grade students Emilee, Lindanis and Juanluis for the great tour of their school. These bright, curious and passionate students represented PES so well and are a testament to the dedicated and caring teachers in their lives. During our tour, they demonstrated a number of ways students and teachers are employing new and innovative methods of thinking and learning and provided a robust update on their activities and things happening in the community. They also asked impressive and insightful questions on current topics in public policy, matters before the Senate as they relate to their community and even expressed a desire to one day have careers in public service. I was pleased to have the Commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, Dr. Randy Watson, along for the tour, as well as State Board of Education member Jean Clifford, USD 483 Superintendent Elton Argo and Principals Ryan Kisner, Dan Frisby and Kurt Stanfield. A special thank you to Bri Frisby for the kind invitation to join these students for the day.   Riley County High School On Thursday, I joined student leaders to tour Riley County High School, home of the Falcons. While touring the school, students and administrators discussed the programs they&#8217;ve implemented to prepare students for their next steps in life. Riley County High School&#8217;s programming emphasizes both technical education, through numerous agriculture, woodworking, and welding courses, as well as college preparatory programs allowing students to capitalize on their time in school and earn credits towards a college degree. Rural schools across Kansas are working to address the shortage in our state&#8217;s workforce by continuing to prioritize STEM education and create career pipelines for students after they graduate.   Newton High School On Friday, I was in Newton where I joined student leaders for a tour of Newton High School. During the tour, I heard updates on fall activities, NHS athletic teams, different things happening in the classroom and new programs and courses. We visited a number of career and technical education-focused classrooms where teachers are working to prepare students for the workforce and various secondary educational paths. My time at Newton High School came just ahead of Department of Education Assistant Secretary Scott Stump&#8217;s tour of the high school&nbsp;&#150; specifically geared toward their career and technical education offerings. I know that Mr. Stump will be as impressed as I was with the quality of work, commitment from students and dedication of teachers at Newton High School.   Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974.

Dear Friend,  You may have missed it amidst all the impeachment hoopla, but President Trump secured another trade victory last week.&nbsp;In a big win for farmers, the United States reached a trade deal with Japan, our third largest agricultural export market. As a result, Japan will reduce tariffs on both fresh and frozen beef and pork. Tariffs will be eliminated or phased out on a multitude of U.S. farm products including several produced in Missouri such as sweet corn, sorghum, ethanol, frozen poultry, processed pork, egg products and wine.&nbsp;The United States, on the other hand, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on several products produced in Japan including green tea, chewing gum, and certain perennial and cut flowers. This is welcome news for U.S consumers.&nbsp;This is a big deal for America. Our farmers will greatly benefit from the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement, with almost unfettered access to the 127 million consumers in Japan. The more markets available, the better it is for rural Missouri, with increased job growth and the potential for rising farm income.&nbsp;While President Trump is busy securing good trade deals for rural America, Nancy Pelosi still won&#8217;t bring the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement to the floor of the House. Impeachment has sucked the oxygen out of the room and nobody in the majority can seem to focus on what&#8217;s actually going to help our country.&nbsp;Passing USMCA is a no-brainer and there&#8217;s no doubt it will happen if it gets to the House floor. The administration secured a good, free, and fair trade deal and it&#8217;s ready to pass. As we all know though, this isn&#8217;t about getting a good deal; it&#8217;s about denying the President a win.&nbsp;In spite of the clear benefits, I&#8217;m willing to bet that if the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement had been required to come to the House floor, it would still be languishing there as well. Thankfully, Nancy Pelosi didn&#8217;t get a say on the Japan deal.&nbsp;It&#8217;s been a tough year for farmers. The U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement is certainly welcome news. Now it&#8217;s time to bring USMCA to a vote and get it done. North Missouri is counting on it.

If that happens, shrinking glaciers in the poles could lead to a massive sea-level rise, harming the planets ability to recover from further warming. \"That metric may seem theoretical, but its not; according to the analysis from The Washington Post, 71 counties have already hit the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit mark, including all five boroughs. \"At a time when America should be leading the global fight against climate change, the Trump Administration has taken our nation backward, recklessly withdrawing us from the Paris Agreement and rolling back countless environmental regulations designed to curb greenhouse-gas emissions.\" To read my my full op-ed, please click here.

Presidential&nbsp;Impeachment: Reviewing President Trump's actions in office  My office received dozens of calls from angry constituents who support the impeachment of President Trump after press reports detailed Trump's threat to withhold foreign aid from Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky conducted a baseless investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.&nbsp;  On September 24th, House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would conduct a full impeachment inquiry of&nbsp;President Trump's actions to determine whether they violate his oath of office.&nbsp; Personally, I believe there is enough evidence to pursue articles of impeachment against this president already.&nbsp; But I do fully support this inquiry in order to present the facts, so my&nbsp;House colleagues can reach their own conclusions.  I am proud to be one of the original supporters of Rep. Al Green's resolution,&nbsp;H. Res. 498, which called for the impeachment of&nbsp;President Trump on July 17, 2019.    &nbsp;  Newark&#8217;s Water Crisis: Providing clean water to Newark's residents  I am extremely concerned about the elevated levels of lead found in Newark&#8217;s drinking water.&nbsp; After all, my family and I drink this water with the rest of the city's residents. The health and safety of constituents is my #1 priority. Right now, my team and I are working with city, state and national officials to&nbsp;help do what needs to be done to get lead out of the water.  But I wanted to see the issue personally, so I volunteered to help my constituents get clean water at two local distribution facilities.&nbsp; I was grateful to the staff at the Bo Porter Sports Complex and Boylan Street Recreation Center for what they do on a daily basis to help our community.&nbsp; I enjoyed meeting with my constituents to hear their concerns about this crisis.&nbsp;        Congressman Payne, Jr. chats with residents and helps distribute bottled water.    We talked about their fears of living with tainted water.&nbsp; I told them what I am doing to help, but also asked them if there were any other actions I could take to&nbsp;make sure a tragedy like this one doesn't happen again. There are many actions I've taken to try and solve the issue.&nbsp; I introduced the Test for Lead Act in Congress already.&nbsp; I co-signed and sent two letters: one to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (find it here) to urge them to provide more assistance to Newark and the other to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (find it here) to expand access to SNAP and low-income food subsidies to cover the additional costs of bottled water.&nbsp;  In addition, I&#8217;m working with my colleague Rep. Grace Napolitano,&nbsp;chairwoman of the Committee of Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the Environment,&nbsp;to find out how we might be able to help the city with federal funding or other resources.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;I&nbsp;voted for&nbsp;legislation in the House that would allow communities the freedom to adjust their budgets to&nbsp;provide additional resources to their water treatment facilities in the event of an emergency.&nbsp; The legislation passed both U.S. Senate and the U.S. House and it needs President Trump's signature to become law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe federal funds are appropriate because what has happened in Flint, MI. and Newark shows that lead contamination from old pipes are a national concern. There are dozens of major cities and small communities across the country that could use an upgrade regarding the way water gets from the aquifers to the household faucets. If we solve Newark&#8217;s water infrastructure issues, we create an example and template we can follow when other cities suffer the same fate. Job Fair for Veterans: Introducing veterans to future employers  More than 100 veterans participated in my annual job fair on August 7th, the largest turnout we&#8217;ve had. Next year, we are going to look at larger facilities&nbsp;in our district to attract even more veterans and the companies that want to hire them. I was excited and grateful to give back to the men and women who have given so much to this country.        An Amazon representative discusses a future career with a veteran (8/7/2019)    Disaster Preparation and Emergency Response: Making sure we are prepared before, during and after a crisis  Last July, I wanted to see if our district was prepared to care for the underserved and most vulnerable people of our community during an emergency. We&#8217;ve seen how changes in our climate have increased the intensity of hurricanes and other natural disasters across the country. I don&#8217;t want what happened in Puerto Rico and New Orleans after they were struck by hurricanes to happen to us.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery of the Committee on Homeland Security, I held a hearing on the matter on July 23rd called &#8220;Protecting Every Citizen: Assessing Emergency Preparedness for Underserved Populations.&#8221; The hearing was held at the Mac Mahon Student Center in Saint Peter&#8217;s University in Jersey City, so it could be accessible to my constituents. The hearing gave all of us a better understanding of the needs of underserved or vulnerable populations before, during, and after a crisis. It was extremely informative to hear from researchers, emergency responders, and community groups regarding&nbsp;how we plan for and meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens before, during and after an emergency.   Increased Manufacturing Base: Creating more manufacturing jobs for New Jersey&nbsp;  No area of our economy has suffered job losses like America&#8217;s manufacturing base. In August, I spoke with members of a local Machinists&#8217; union about how we can increase the opportunities for workers affected by these job losses. The event is important because it gives me an opportunity to listen as well as speak about possible solutions to the problems that face our workers and communities.        Rep. Payne speaks to Machinists' union (8/6/2019)    Legislation:  I have&nbsp;introduced or signed on to support several legislative initiatives. I wanted to give you a brief introduction to just a few of those measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Payment Choice: Giving residents the choice to pay in cash  Recently, I heard that more businesses are trying to get rid of cash as a form of payment for goods and services. Companies say it will make it easier for consumers. In truth, it will make it easier for companies to secure transactions, reduce the risk of crime, and speed up the process to serve more customers and make more money.  While I applaud the innovation behind these technological advances, we must remember that they aren&#8217;t always good for everyone. Nearly 25 percent of Americans don&#8217;t have access to digital forms of payments, including credit or debit cards. If we eliminate cash payments, we eliminate the only&nbsp;option for these consumers, including seniors and low-income residents, to buy their groceries and pay for other goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is why I teamed with fellow New Jersey delegation member Rep. Chris Smith to introduce the &#8220;Payment Choice Act of 2019.&#8221; This bill would protect cash as a form of payment and require retailers to give consumers the choice to pay with credit cards, debit cards, or cash. The New Jersey State Legislature passed a similar law this year. I want consumers here and across the country to still be able to pay for items &#8220;the old-fashioned way.&#8221;  Return of Local and State Tax Deductions: Returning tax money to Americans  President Trump&nbsp;put a limit on the amount of state and local taxes that workers could deduct from their federal income tax.&nbsp; His Tax Cuts and Jobs Act caps the State and Local Tax deduction, also known as the SALT deduction, to $10,000. Previously, there was no cap on deductions.  This is a major concern for me because it hit the middle&nbsp;and lower class residents in&nbsp;our community the hardest.&nbsp; My&nbsp;constituents averaged more than $17,000 in SALT deductions last year.&nbsp; On average, this current law will deny taxpayers an additional $7,000 per year in deductions.&nbsp; I am working to repeal it, so the hard-working families of our 10th District can get that money back in&nbsp;their pockets.  Donald Payne, Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act: Giving patients more payment options for treatment  My father, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Sr., died of colorectal cancer. Even though his cancer is a preventable disease, his cancer screening happened too late to catch it in time. Sadly, his case was not unique.        Donald Payne, Sr.    One out of every four Americans between the ages of 50 and 75 fail to get screened for this deadly disease. African-American men are particularly vulnerable. They are 20 percent more likely to get colorectal cancer and 45 percent more likely to die from it than white men. The American Cancer Society recently found that incidences and deaths due to colorectal cancer are even increasing in people younger than 50.  On June 4th, I testified before the House Ways and Means Committee about my&nbsp;bill, The Donald Payne, Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act, because it would address this issue directly. Until recently, there were only two methods for colorectal cancer screening: colonoscopy and stool tests. Fortunately, there is a new test that can detect the disease with a simple blood draw. It can be done during a lunch hour in any facility that can draw blood. This test has the potential to significantly increase screening and save countless lives.  Another big issue with colon cancer is how to pay to fight it. Right now, Medicare will cover the screening, but not the treatment. If doctors find cancer cells and a growth, they must wait until the patient recovers from the screening to ask if they want the cancer removed. My bill would provide Medicare coverage for all FDA-approved, blood-based tests for colorectal cancer screening and the treatment, if cancer is found. That way we can prevent what happened to my father from happening to other fathers nationwide.  SAFE Act of 2019: Making our elections safer and easier for voters  Nothing is more important to democracy than faith in the electoral system. This is why Russia is so desperate to hack and infiltrate our social media. They want to create distrust in our elections and our democracy.  I signed on to the SAFE Act to strengthen the security of our elections and the trust in our democracy. The Act will address election security concerns through grant programs and requirements for voting systems and paper ballots. Thanks to this act, the Election Assistance Commission will have several new responsibilities. It must award grants to states to replace certain voting systems, carry out voting system security improvements,&nbsp;find the best way to design a ballot, write instructions for how to use that ballot, and test the ease of use for future ballots. I believe these actions will make our elections safer and easier for voters.  Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2019: Denying airlines the right to overcharge passengers during a crisis  In September, I introduced the Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2019, legislation to prevent airplane ticket price gouging before and after disasters. Climate change has increased the number of natural disasters dramatically. When they hit, area residents have few options available to take shelter and find safety, particularly when they are stuck on an&nbsp;island. During the time of&nbsp;Hurricane Maria, major airlines&nbsp;significantly raised their ticket prices in Puerto Rico. Many citizens who tried to evacuate&nbsp;before or after that&nbsp;disaster were trapped because they couldn&#8217;t afford the outrageous costs. My bill would prevent such airline abuse in the future for all Americans.  Raise the Wage Act of 2019: Giving minimum wage workers the raise they deserve  We need to give our workers a raise to show our appreciation for&nbsp;the hard work and effort they&nbsp;put in every day.&nbsp; I co-sponsored this legislation because it would increase the federal minimum wage for regular employees over a seven-year period, tipped employees, and newly hired employees who are under the age of 20 years old.  The bill would increase the minimum wage every year for six years until it reached $15 per hour for regular employees.&nbsp; It would provide other increases for disabled employees as well as employees who receive tips as a substantial portion of their wages.&nbsp; A pay raise for these workers is long overdue.&nbsp; This legislation would give employees a living wage and increase economic opportunities in their communities.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Gateway Project Update: Pushing to rebuild bridges and tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey        Gateway construction area    In September, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing on federal grants for state infrastructure projects. The Gateway Program, which will replace decaying bridges and tunnels connecting New Jersey and New York, is the most critical infrastructure project in the country. The federal government promised to fund half of the total cost of the project and then began to backtrack on that promise.&nbsp; That agreement should be honored. During the hearing, I questioned the acting Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration on why they are holding up federal funding for the Portal North Bridge project when it is ready to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need this project funded and these improvements made immediately.  Constituent Correspondence: Responding to Constituent Concerns  The thousands of letters I receive from constituents are extremely important to me.&nbsp; During the time period from January 3 to September 30, 2019, I received 18,860 letters from constituents throughout the district about a variety of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Constituent Letters based on City of Origin&nbsp;   I appreciate your letters and your concerns about issues that affect our district.&nbsp; The most popular subjects were support for impeaching President Trump, support for the Dreamers and Promise Act, support for gun control regulation, support for the Climate Action Now Act, support for legislation to support the Green New Deal, support for the Equality Act, support for a ban on toxic pesticides, support for the Social Security Fairness Act, support for stronger rules against robocalls, and support for the Saving America's Pollinators Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;  In closing, it has been a busy time for legislative and district activities.&nbsp; These are but a few of the actions I&#8217;ve taken during the last few months to improve the health and prosperity of all my constituents. I hope you are having a great Fall and let me know how I can be of service in the future.  Sincerely, Donald M.

Despite the chaos swirling around Washington, Rep. Lee understands that drug prices are still too high, education is still unaffordable, and many are still struggling to make ends meet. From southern Nevada to DC, Rep. Lee remains committed to helping find solutions to these tough problems.  Weekly Recap  Last Thursday, Rep. Lee--who is&nbsp;Chairwoman of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Technology Modernization--oversaw a hearing to hold the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accountable for its blatant ineffectiveness in implementing a modernized patient scheduling system. Prolonged appointment scheduling and wait times at VA health facilities remain long-standing issues within the VA, and this is in part due to the VA&#8217;s confusing and outdated patient appointment scheduling system.&nbsp;As the&nbsp;member of Congress in charge of overseeing VA's electronic&nbsp;health care system and much of their duty to deliver health care to&nbsp;military veterans, Chairwoman Lee refuses to waiver in holding VA accountable for the implementation of the scheduling system, and their assurance that taxpayer dollars will be used responsibly.&nbsp;Learn more about the hearing .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Later that day, Rep. Lee and Senator Dick Durbin (Ill.) introduced legislation to overturn Education Secretary Betsy DeVos&#8217;s rewritten borrower defense rule&nbsp;that gutted essential protections for student borrowers and taxpayers. The original 2016 Borrower Defense Rule was a commonsense policy meant to level the playing field between students and the predatory colleges taking advantage of them. But Secretary DeVos&#8217;s new rule makes the process of applying for and granting borrower defense forgiveness unnecessarily difficult and burdensome for the students who we are supposed to be protecting.&nbsp; The original Borrower Defense Rule was projected to secure $17 billion in relief for defrauded students by 2020. According to the Department of Education&#8217;s own estimates, the new DeVos rule is expected to garner only a fraction of that. Read more about the resolution .  On Friday, Reps. Lee and Katie Porter (Calif.-45) sent a letter to the House Appropriations Committee requesting support for increased investment in Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs in the final Fiscal Year 2020 budget.&nbsp;Rep. Lee is committed to addressing southern Nevada&#8217;s doctor shortage, which has reached crisis levels in recent years. Increasing GME slots will help increase opportunities for&nbsp;medical students and young doctors, and give them chances to set down roots for their careers in southern Nevada. Read the full letter .  In the District    This weekend, Rep. Lee joined the southern Nevada community to celebrate Nevada's 3rd Annual Public Lands Day.&nbsp;    Rep. Lee rolled up her sleeves and grabbed a shovel to help Kesterson Elementary build their school garden. The garden build was led by Green Our Planet, an organization that runs the largest school garden program in the country.&nbsp;  Coming Up  Rep. Lee will be joined by House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott ofVirginia, to deliver remarks at the Nevada State College 'State of Higher Education' event. They will discuss higher education access and affordability, education policies for minority students, and higher education in southern Nevada. RSVP HERE if you would like to attend! Details below.

Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) to improve STEM opportunities for minority students at minority-serving institutions.&nbsp;This bill would increase the capacity for students in STEM fields and build research competitiveness so minority students will be equipped with the tools they need to enter the STEM workforce. Minorities make up 27 percent of the population but are severely underrepresented in STEM fields, only accounting for 11 percent of the workforce.&nbsp;STEM fields are huge drivers in our economy and it&#8217;s critical we expand the talent pool to fill STEM jobs.This bill can now head to the House floor for a full vote and I&#8217;m looking forward to it passing! Click below to watch me discuss this bill in our committee hearing:     PROTECTING FLORIDA'S WATERWAYS:&nbsp;As Floridians, we all know how important clean water is to our way of life and to our economy. I&#8217;m proud to announce that last week, the House passed one of my amendments as part of the first-ever federal action plan to combat harmful algal blooms in Florida. My amendment to include regional coastal waters like the Indian River Lagoon as part of this protection was included in this bill. I&#8217;m thankful for the leadership of Rep. Brian Mast and Sen. Marco Rubio, who sponsored these bills. Gov. Ron DeSantis has also made clean water and resiliency a priority in our state.

New Trade Agreement with Japan On Wednesday, President Trump announced a trade agreement between the United States and Japan that will reduce or eliminate tariffs on $7 billion of U.S. agricultural goods when implemented including on Kansas beef, pork, sorghum and wheat. Japan is currently the second-largest ag export market for Kansas and once implemented, this agreement will further expand export opportunities for Kansas producers. I look forward to reviewing all of the details of this agreement, and I&#8217;ll continue working with my colleagues in Washington, D.C. and Kansas farmers and ranchers to find permanent solutions to ongoing trade conflicts.  Pelosi Announces Impeachment Proceedings for President Trump &nbsp;Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced impeachment proceedings for President Trump. Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s actions are a rush to judgement and were made before most of the facts were known. Absent concrete evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors, Congress should not use impeachment proceedings to overturn the results of an election. Since President Trump&#8217;s election, Democrats have been trying to delegitimize his presidency, and unfounded impeachment of President Trump would only further fracture our already divided country. Passing Critical Appropriations Bills for FY2020 On Thursday, the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved my bill, the&nbsp;FY2020 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Act. This legislation provides funding for the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation, and related agencies. I take my role of being a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars very seriously and I&#8217;m pleased this bill is fiscally responsible and prioritizes key investments for public safety, law enforcement, rural broadband, aerospace initiatives and infrastructure, the National Science Foundation, NASA and a number of additional programs important to Kansans. In addition, this bill accelerates the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon, cements America&#8217;s leadership in space exploration and includes important resources for STEM Education programs to inspire the next generation of scientists. This legislation will also provide a pay raise for law enforcement and continue to fund important programs to keep communities in Kansas safe. This includes programs created by the&nbsp;STOP School Violence Act&nbsp;and resources to conduct &#8220;Operation Triple Bean&#8221; and &#8220;Operation Save a Casing.&#8221; Kansans will benefit from this legislation for many years to come, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this measure to the President&#8217;s desk.  Watch Highlights from my Service Academy Day One of the greatest responsibilities I have as a U.S. Senator is to nominate Kansas students to attend service academies. Last week, applicants from across Kansas interviewed before my Service Academy Selection Board, another step in the process of securing a nomination to one of our service academies. I am proud of these young students for their desire to serve our nation, and I&#8217;m grateful to the Service Academy Selection Board for the thoughtful consideration they put into the application process. These students applying to enter service academies represent the best of Kansas, and it was an honor to spend time with them in Hutchinson. To watch a short recap of the day, click&nbsp;here.    Announcing Contracts to Complete Remediation of the Sunflower Army Plant This week, the Army awarded two new contracts to continue much-needed remediation at the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant in De Soto. This ammunition plant was decommissioned in 1997, and since then, Kansans have made significant efforts to redevelop the land. I appreciate that the Army has added more work to its cleanup efforts and has kept the De Soto and Johnson County communities apprised of their work after my requests for increased action and transparency. I will continue to work closely with Johnson County leaders, local officials and the Army to see this project to completion. KC Federal Reserve President and CEO Testifies Before Banking Committee On Wednesday, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Esther George, testified before the Senate Banking Committee. The hearing provided members of the committee with an overview of the payments system in the United States, as well as ways to improve the financial transactions that we use every day. Last month, the Federal Reserve Board announced a project to develop a faster payments system in the United States called&nbsp;FedNow. This system will provide Kansans with real-time payment capabilities and vastly improve the speed and efficiency of financial transactions. Community banks and small businesses serve a wide-range of customers in our expanding economy and require a faster payments system that can meet those demands. Ms. George will be the Executive Sponsor of the project and I look forward to working with her to ensure the&nbsp;FedNow&nbsp;service meets the needs of Kansas businesses and banks.

Questioning VA Healthcare Leaders on Toxic Exposure On Wednesday, during a Senate Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs&nbsp;hearing I questioned Dr. David Butler of the National Academies of Sciences regarding servicemember toxic exposure and the efforts underway to monitor and prevent toxic exposure and the health conditions it can inflict. In 2014, I attended a conference in Wichita hosted by the Vietnam Veterans of America on toxic exposure and I visited with veterans who experienced the consequences of exposure and learned about the health conditions that children and grandchildren suffer from due to what is believed to be toxic exposure. In light of this, I introduced the&nbsp;Toxic Exposure Research Act of 2016&nbsp;which was unanimously passed in late 2016. This bill included a provision that required a scientific review and assessment to be conducted by the National Academies of Sciences regarding toxicological and epidemiological research on descendants of individuals with toxic exposure and the descendants of those individuals. It also required the creation of a board to advise the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs on the research of toxic exposure. The National Academies of Sciences published their report in November of last year which confirmed that there is a substantial lack of information on the generational effects of toxic exposure. The next step, as prescribed in my bill, is to begin monitoring and researching the generational effects of toxic exposure. I look forward to seeing the VA&#8217;s plan for achieving that next step and will continue to pay close attention to the outcomes of this research to improve the healthcare and livelihood of our nation&#8217;s great veterans.   Working to Fuel Air Traffic Control Innovation On On Tuesday, I attended a Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation and Space hearing focused on improving the air traffic control system. During the hearing, I questioned witnesses from across the aviation industry on how we can best adapt and evolve our systems. With recent attempts to privatize air traffic control, it is imperative that we maintain strong support for this complex network and those who operate it. I also discussed my recent legislation, the&nbsp;Aviation Funding Stability Act,&nbsp;that would help protect the aviation sector from the damages caused by a government shutdown. Previous shutdowns have impacted every function of aviation and air travel, all while putting a strain on air traffic controllers nationwide. While I&#8217;ve long said that we must avoid government shutdowns, it is crucial that we have the safety net of this legislation to provide much-needed certainty to those who rely on the FAA. Click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch these remarks and click&nbsp;here&nbsp;to read more on my&nbsp;Aviation Funding Stability Act.   Meeting with the Secretary of the Air Force Nominee On Tuesday, I met with Ambassador Barbara Barrett, nominee to be the Secretary of the Air Force. During our meeting, we discussed her vision for the future of the Air Force and how we can work together to continue Kansas&#8217; contributions to our national defense strategy. We specifically discussed Kansas&#8217; role as the home of the Air Force&#8217;s new tanker, the KC-46. While I am pleased that McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita was selected as the first base to fly the new tanker, I expressed my concerns with the problems that have plagued this aircraft and their subsequent impact on Team McConnell. Ambassador Barrett confirmed that she will prioritize developing a plan to get the KC-46 operational so our Airmen can utilize their new tanker. We also discussed the Air Force&#8217;s procurement of the Light Attack Aircraft.&nbsp; For several years, the Air Force has relied on industry partners, including Textron in Wichita, Kansas, to test aircraft that would provide a low-cost way to strike violent extremist and reduce the burden placed on 4th and 5th Generation fighter planes. Kansas has always played a leading role in supporting our nation&#8217;s military. I look forward to working with Ambassador Barrett to advance Air Force and Kansan priorities.   Participating in the Ag Outlook Forum On Monday, I welcomed Kansas and Missouri agricultural leaders to the Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, hosted by the Agricultural Business Council of Kansas City and Agri-Pulse. The annual forum gives overview of the agricultural economy, details recent innovations and technology updates, and provides for collaboration between area ag and animal health stakeholders. During my remarks to those in attendance, I discussed my work in the Senate to get USMCA across the finish line and I gave an update on appropriations measures to provide the resources necessary for the USDA to execute their planned relocations of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to Kansas City, as well as resources for the completion of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan. These facilities are crucial to the animal health corridor that runs through our state, and I&#8217;ll continue working with the administration and my colleagues to see these projects through. A special thanks to USDA Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky for joining the forum and to Agricultural Business Council of Kansas City CEO Bob Petersen for inviting me to join for the event.   Attending the Ribbon-Cutting for SunPorch of Smith Center On Friday, I was pleased to join healthcare leaders and community officials for the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the new SunPorch of Smith Center. This facility will feature skilled nursing beds, assisted living apartments and senior housing units located adjacent to the newly-built Smith County Memorial Hospital &amp; Smith County Family Practice. Thank you to John Grace for his efforts in spearheading this development and to the Schrader and Hubbard Foundations and U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development for their support of this project.   Celebrating 75 Years of Lindsborg Community Hospital For 75 years, Lindsborg Community Hospital (LCH) has been providing high-quality healthcare to those in Lindsborg and the surrounding area. On Sunday, I joined local residents, community leaders, healthcare providers and hospital officials to celebrate the 75th anniversary of LCH and the many individuals who have given back to their friends and neighbors over the years. A special thank you to LCH CEO Larry Van Der Wege and Board Chair Chuck Oleen for their leadership and the kind invitation to attend Sunday&#8217;s celebration.   Hosting More Kansas Listening Tour Stops Smith County On Friday, following the ribbon-cutting for SunPorch of Smith Center, I hosted a Smith County stop on my Kansas Listening Tour. During this stop, I joined community officials, business leaders and local residents to discuss a number of issues including healthcare in rural communities, veterans&#8217; access to care, agriculture and the need to pass the USMCA, immigration, gun violence and rural broadband. Thanks to all those who took time out of their day to share their thoughts and ideas with me.   Jewell County On Friday, I joined local producers for Mankato Livestock Inc.&#8217;s Friday sale. While at the sale, I visited with local farmers and ranchers regarding recent issues in ag and trade, including the need to pass USMCA so our producers have greater access to Canadian and Mexican markets, as well as the recently-announced trade agreement with Japan.We also discussed my work to support the ag community and make certain rural communities have sufficient access to broadband and needed digital infrastructure. Thanks to all those in Mankato for their productive conversation that helps to shape my work in Washington, D.C., and to Mankato Livestock Inc. for allowing me to join Friday&#8217;s sale. Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974.

Or maybe you do it the old-fashioned way with a pen and paper. Regardless of how you keep track of it, your to-do list says a lot about your priorities. After last week, it is crystal clear the only thing on Washington Democrats' to-do list is \"impeach President Donald Trump.\" *They've already spent countless time and at least $25 million in wasted tax dollars on the Mueller Report - which showed zero collusion. *They've already forced the House of Representatives to vote three separate times on impeachment - and each vote failed. They've already tried time and again to launch a partisan impeachment process in search of a crime, and last week was no different. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rushed to announce an \"impeachment inquiry\" based on unsubstantiated, anonymous and secondhand allegations. *This is unprecedented. *The White House released the transcript of the call in question and proved these rumors to be false - there was no quid pro quo and there were no laws broken on the call. *These partisan tactics and their one-item agenda won't improve your or your family's lives.* It's clear Congressional Democrats' hatred for our president far outweighs their desire to accomplish things in a bipartisan way. At the end of the day, you deserve better. There are countless items that should be on Congress's to-do list - like lowering drug prices, paying our troops, securing our border, improving our economy and updating our nation's infrastructure. The most frustrating thing about all this is we've made some great strides on important issues in spite of Washington Democrats' unwillingness to work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if bipartisanship was at the top of their to-do list! We've seen progress like a stronger economy and more opportunities for our nation's veterans.* According to data recently released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), our country's 19.2 million veterans have a jobless rate of just 3.5% - a near record-low. *Good policies like tax reform and smarter regulations have led to a strong and stable economy that empowers veterans with the skills needed to transition to civilian life and find good-paying jobs. *Another big factor is a law I helped champion called the Forever GI Bill. *This was the largest expansion of GI Bill benefits in a decade, and it was a bipartisan effort - both Republicans and Democrats worked together to get it done for our nation's heroes. We've also seen progress like lower-income workers seeing more opportunities with higher wages. According to recent reports, the percentage of lower-income workers in America who found new job opportunities nearly tripled. *This progress is being driven by the longest economic expansion on record, and our workers are benefitting tremendously.* Finally, we've seen progress like lower health premiums for seniors. It was announced last week that on average, Medicare Advantage premiums in 2020 are expected to decline 23% from 2018. *And on top of that, plan choices, benefits and enrollment continue to increase.* In fact, the Medicare Advantage average monthly premium will be the lowest in the last 13 years for millions of people. *While this is all incredible progress, can you imagine how much better it would be if Washington Democrats joined Republicans - put the partisan impeachment charade aside - and worked in a bipartisan way on our nation's actual priorities?* As I said to my colleagues at an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week, our constituents don't care which party had which idea, they just want solutions. *Working towards bipartisan solutions that benefit our community will always be at the top of my to-do list.* *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* [image = [link 1] [image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] [image = [link 6] [image = [link 7] [image = [link 8] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Website: Office Locations: Washington, DC Office 2112 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: 202-225-3715 | Fax: (202) 225-4036 Hours: M-F 8:30am-6:00pm Concord Office 325 McGill Avenue, NW, Suite 500 Concord, NC 28027 Phone: (704) 786-1612 Fax: (704) 782-1004 Hours: M-F 8:30am-5:30pm Fayetteville Office 225 Green Street, Suite 202 Fayetteville, NC 28301 Phone: (910) 997-2070 Fax: (910) 817-7202 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30-5:30pm and by appointment Pinehurst Office Sandhills Community College Logan Building 3395 Airport Road, Suite 221 Pinehurst, NC 28374 (910) 246-5374 Hours: Tues/Thurs 8:30am-5:30pm and by appointment Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ","district":"8","title":"Representative","gender":"M","state":"NC","party":"Republican","score":3.843221},{"name":"Congressman Buddy Carter","address":"GA01Newsletter@mail.house.gov","timestamp":"2019-09-29","subject":"Veterans Expo Wednesday!","body":"VETERANS EXPO WEDNESDAY!

THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING This week on Buddy's Briefing, I discuss House Democrat's reckless decision to open a formal impeachment inquiry into the President of the United States. I've read the transcript of the telephone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine as well as the whistleblower report. There is absolutely no reason for impeachment and there is no \"smoking gun.\" It's disappointing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue these attacks on our president while we should be doing the business of the American people. Click here for my thoughts in this week's episode. Click here for this week's episode of Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXXXV Monday, September 23, 2019: I start off in our Savannah office this morning and have a delightful meeting with a student seeking her doctorate degree as a nurse practitioner to discuss health care policy, including access to health care and cost of care and prescriptions. Next, I have a meeting with Lyndsey Rudder, a former Savannahian who lives in the Atlanta area now and will be a candidate for a vacant state appellate court seat. Afterwards, I head to Brunswick in Glynn County where I meet with Bruce Fendig with the Brunswick Bar Pilots Association to discuss the situation in the Brunswick Harbor following the grounding of the Golden Ray roro vessel. Later, I host a roundtable meeting at the Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce office with community stakeholders interested in bringing together resources for homeless individuals in the area. Homelessness, particularly veteran homelessness, is a serious problem in our district and in our nation, and it will take all of us working together to alleviate the problem. This well attended meeting gives us a great opportunity to help the different groups become more aware of each other and learn of each others abilities and goals. Tuesday, September 24, 2019: After an early flight to Washington this morning, I spend most of my morning catching up on office work before my first meeting with Greg Kelly, Executive Director of the Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport. On Thursday of this week we will be considering a bill in the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee Environment Subcommittee dealing with a group of chemicals, PFAS, that could potentially adversely impact the airport. Following our weekly staff briefing, I meet with representatives from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization before meeting with representatives from the Federal Bureau of Prisons including some members from the Jesup prison. Next, I meet with representatives from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) GA followed by a meeting with members of the American Camber of Commerce in Shanghai who, as one would imagine, are very concerned about the tariff situation with China. During the day there has been much speculation that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) would be calling for a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trumps communications with Ukrainian President Volodmymyr Zelensky. During my meetings this afternoon, the Speaker has acknowledged she would be moving forward with this. After a meeting with Nutritional-Specialties representatives to discuss the development of a prototype formula and delivery system that would eliminate severe malnutrition in children at home and abroad, I film a video addressing the impeachment announcement. A link to that video can be found here. Afterwards, I have a meeting with the Savannah Chapter of the Independent Freight Forwarders and Customs Brokers Association before heading to an E&C member meeting to discuss the prescription drug pricing plan that has been proposed by Speaker Pelosi. Next, I head to our weekly Whip Team meeting after which I head to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the week and afterwards, I pay tribute to Harry Sweezey. A link to my tribute can be found here. Wednesday, September 25, 2019: Things are certainly abuzz in Washington this morning and I begin with a series of radio interviews at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) Radio Row broadcasts in downtown Washington. First, I have an interview with my good friend Scott James with Talk 92.1 in Valdosta. Although we briefly talk about immigration issues, much of our discussion is on the topic at hand - the impeachment inquiries into President Trump. Afterwards, I have an interview with Rose Tennent with WSYL News Power 1040 in Pittsburgh, PA, regarding a number of issues, but again dominated by the news of the day - the Presidential impeachment inquiries. Once back at the Capitol, I head to our weekly GOP Conference meeting and afterwards head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to former Savannah State University President Cyrus Wiley, the Georgia Air National Guard, EMD Performance Materials and World Pharmacists Day. A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here. Next, I head to an E&C Health Subcommittee hearing on prescription drug pricing. A link to my questions can be found here. Afterwards, I head back to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day and then head to a members only bipartisan counterintelligence briefing before heading back to my office for a conference call with community pharmacists. Next, I have a live interview on MSNBC with my friend Ali Velshi to discuss the impeachment inquiries. A link to my interview can be found here. After returning to my office, I meet with representatives from the Golf Industry in the State of Georgia before having a phone interview with WSAV TV in Savannah regarding the impeachment inquiries. Next, I have a series of office meetings beginning with representatives from EMD Serono and followed by representatives from Interfaith Working Group on Foreign Assistance, including Pooler resident Jared Brown. After a meeting with representatives from Rayonier, including my good friend Charlie Hood, I have an on-camera interview with WTOC TV in Savannah to discuss the impeachment inquiries. Next, I head to the House Chamber where we have our second vote series of the day and afterwards, I head downtown where I speak at the Managed Health Care Associates (MHA) conference. Thursday, September 26, 2019: Im always glad to talk to my good friend Bill Edwards with WTKS news radio 1290 in Savannah and this morning we have plenty to talk about with the impeachment inquiries. Later, I have a live interview on National Public Radio (NPR) to discuss the impeachment inquiries and then head to an E&C Environment Subcommittee markup. Afterwards, I have a conference call with the American Pharmacy Cooperative, Inc., before heading to the Cannon Rotunda where I have an on-camera interview with the BBC on the impeachment inquiries. Next, I head to a Select Committee on Climate Change hearing on Industrial Emissions. A link to my questions can be found here. Following a phone call with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai to discuss proposed FCC rule changes, I have a radio interview with Georgia Public Radio (GPB) on the impeachment inquiries before taping this weeks episode of Buddys Briefings in the Rayburn Room in the Capitol. Next, I head to a House Energy Action Team (HEAT) meeting in the Capitol followed by our first and only vote series of the day. After votes, I remain in the House Chamber and pay tribute to Dr. Lucy Greene from Valdosta, truly one of the most dedicated public servants I have ever known. A link to my tribute to this special lady can be found here. Friday, September 27, 2019: This morning Im in the House Chamber as I speak on National Clean Energy Week across America this week. A link to my comments can be found here. After returning to my office where I catch up on some work before we start a two-week district work schedule, I return to the House Chamber for our last vote series of the week. Later, I head to the airport for my return trip home and once I arrive in Savannah, I head straight to the Benedictine-Savannah High School football game where I perform the coin toss for this traditional rivalry. Later, Im also able to make it to the Brunswick High School-New Hampstead football game in Pooler that turns out to be an exciting game with Brunswick pulling out a victory in the second half.

On Tuesday, September 24, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was pursuing an &#8220;official impeachment inquiry&#8221; into President Trump.&nbsp; The only problem is, that term is meaningless.  Normally &#151; though nothing about impeachment is normal &#151; the House votes on an impeachment authorization, which allows a committee (usually the Judiciary Committee) to investigate impeachable conduct. This has not happened. So, just like Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler&#8217;s claim that the committee has been in &#8220;an impeachment investigation,&#8221; which is equally untrue, Speaker Pelosi&#8217;s announcement doesn&#8217;t really mean anything.&nbsp;  She knows this perfectly well; her choice of words was intentional.  The Speaker is&nbsp;trying to appease the far left, without actually doing anything.&nbsp;    Meanwhile, Democrats who are eager to rush into a fact-free impeachment seem to have forgotten&nbsp;their own words on the subject from not too long ago. I guess memory fades quickly here in DC:        Click to Play!    I recently went on Fox Business to discuss my thoughts with Trish Regan. Watch below:&nbsp;        Click to Play!    The whole impeachment imbroglio is a pity, both for the House, and for the American people. There&#8217;s a lot of work Congress can and should be doing, and when we work together, it&#8217;s possible for the House to pass important legislation. For instance, despite the not-really-impeachment circus consuming most media attention, this week showed that bipartisan progress is possible.&nbsp;  On Wednesday, September 25, the House passed an important bill: H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act. This bill is simple: it allows state-legal cannabis businesses access to financial institutions, like banks and credit unions. Allowing these businesses access to banks is important, both for their safety (and the safety of their employees), but for transparency, honesty, and domestic job growth as well.&nbsp; I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of this bill, which passed the House 321&#150;103 on Wednesday. I also wrote an op-ed about this important legislation, which you can read here:  The Hill &#151; September 24, 2019  Give cannabis businesses access to financial institutions &#151; pass the SAFE Banking Act  I wish we pursued more bipartisan priorities like this, instead of silly bills to improve healthcare for illegal immigrants, which came to a vote this week (and which I voted against). This bill, H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act, requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to set up an electronic health records (EHR) system for illegal immigrants.&nbsp;  The Departments of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense will not have similar systems for another 9 and 5 years, respectively.&nbsp; In other words, this legislation would put illegal immigrants in line for health screenings before America&#8217;s veterans and servicemembers.&nbsp;  This is unacceptable, and I know this is NOT the sort of &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; that the American people want.&nbsp; Although this passed the House almost entirely on party lines &#151; which is very telling! &#151; it seems unlikely that this terrible bill will be taken up by the Senate.

Make no mistake - their motivation isn't about saving the environment - it's about controlling our lives.* * #2: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* [image = *My number two spot goes to proud socialist and Democrat standard-bearer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is well known for bad ideas but also for climate hypocrisy. Despite claiming [link 2], 'The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change', she doesn't seem to have any problem frequently utilizing rideshare apps or airfare over \"eco-friendly\" public transit and walking. Her radical Green New Deal would put countless Americans out of work - it would end America as we know it - but AOC doesn't think twice about living lavishly in her luxury apartment building, taking a car one mile to work, and believing her $174,000 taxpayer-funded salary should be higher.* * #1: Al Gore* * [image = *Last, but certainly not least, Al Gore has earned the grand prize of America's greatest climate hypocrite. Whether it's Gore's chartered jets around the country or the fact [link 3] his home uses up to 34 times more energy than the average American household, he's never wavered in his calls for everyone else to, '...make [environmental] changes in their own lives.' The actual 'Inconvenient Truth' is his hypocrisy - it is beyond absurd but typical of Hollywood elites. * ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] Office Locations: Washington, DC Office: 205 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 -3603 Main: (202) 224-4721 Fax: (202) 228-0380 Tulsa, OK Office: 1924 S.

This is the latest in a years long effort to impeach the President that started after election day 2016. But I would like to focus on something that will help the 5th District and provide great relief to farmers in Virginia. Yesterday we were able to secure Virginia&#8217;s inclusion in a federal crop insurance program for industrial hemp. This program will allow for exponential growth in hemp production and is a huge win for Virginia and the 5th District. Hemp growers in Virginia are prime to lead and the 5th District is prime to lead based on its historic production of tobacco. Virginia is already one of the top hemp producers in the country and its inclusion in this pilot program will help farmers and grow the economy in the 5th District. In August, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue joined me and my Agricultural roundtable to discuss issues facing local farmers in the 5th District and one of the issues brought up was hemp farming and how Virginia could become a leader in this space. Joining this pilot program is a major step that will help Virginia farmers and I am very excited to share this news with you.

As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, House Democrats are proceeding on impeachment against President Trump. However, they&#8217;re doing it without any evidence of wrongdoing and against the will of the American people! It&#8217;s unbelievable. Instead of helping this country, Democrats have simply wasted everyone&#8217;s time. This is Trump Derangement Syndrome at its finest.  Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn an election that didn&#8217;t go their way by spinning fairy tales of Russian collusion and claiming they had evidence of it. Did they? No. There was no collusion and no obstruction. Now, in their continued efforts to remove President Trump from office, they are moving on to the next shiny object. If this accusation fails to achieve the opposition&#8217;s desired result, they&#8217;ll just keep trying with another issue.  I&#8217;m glad that President Trump released the unredacted transcript of his conversation with the President of Ukraine so the American people can see exactly what was said. No quid pro quo, no talk of aid, no crimes committed. The &#8220;whistleblower account&#8221; is also nothing more than salacious rumors, conjecture, and hearsay along with press clips from someone without any direct knowledge of the situations described. Not a single word of this would be admissible in an actual court of law, so the Democrats are resorting to attempted smears in the court of public opinion.&nbsp;  But the fact remains: it&#8217;s chilling to see an entire political party unify and back impeachment before the facts are revealed. That&#8217;s truly telling &#150; they hate this President so much. The left and some extremely biased members of the mainstream media have perpetuated the Russian collusion hoax and now Ukraine in an incredibly irresponsible way. Report first &#150; accuse first &#150; fact-find later. Remember folks, in the words of Democrat Rep. Al Green, &#8220;I&#8217;m concerned that if we don&#8217;t impeach this President, he will get re-elected.&#8221; That&#8217;s what this is all about. They can&#8217;t stomach the thought of President Trump in the White House for four more years, so they are going to continue the mindless and unhinged witch hunts.&nbsp;  In other news&#133;  Update on E-Cigarettes&nbsp; This week, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on youth e-cigarette use and the recently reported deaths and lung illnesses that have been associated with that. I had the chance to dig deeper into how vaping devices are being abused with counterfeit, black-market THC products, which are causing real and dangerous health issues. You can view my full line of questioning HERE.&nbsp;  American Energy&nbsp; As Co-Chair of the House Energy Action Team (HEAT), I cosponsored a new bill introduced by Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) titled the &#8220;American Energy First Act&#8221; along with my colleagues Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), and Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.). This legislation is an all-of-the-above American energy strategy. The bill incentivizes efficient onshore and offshore production of both conventional and renewable energy resources. By doing so, we will lessen our dependence on foreign energy resources and lower overall energy costs for all Americans. For more information on the bill, click HERE.&nbsp;  Want to know more about American energy dominance? Read my latest op-ed HERE.&nbsp;  Want to know more about nuclear energy and nuclear waste in particular? Read my latest op-ed HERE entitled &#8220;Sen. Elizabeth Warren is weak on waste.&#8221;&nbsp;  NLRB and The Boeing Company&nbsp; As you may remember, a group of congressional Democrats, all on the far left and not affiliated with our state, took an extreme interest in South Carolina&#8217;s workforce affairs last year. The two groups of Democrats sent letters to the CEO of Boeing asking him to drop his appeal of their flight technician&#8217;s vote to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW).&nbsp;  It was infuriating to see far left Democrats from other states telling our companies and workers what they think is best for them. Businesses like Boeing, BMW, Volvo, and others come to South Carolina for our highly-skilled workforce, our fantastic business climate, and our right-to-work status. They don&#8217;t come to our state for a big government, socialist agenda pushed by the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  I was very pleased to hear earlier this month that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled in favor of Boeing&#8217;s appeal and against an unlawful and inappropriate micro-union by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers&#8217; at the Charleston facility. With this decision behind them, Boeing can move on and continue to focus on making an amazing product, employing thousands of South Carolinians, and significantly contributing to our state&#8217;s economy. You can view my full statement on the issue HERE.&nbsp;  ICYMI While this is not a federal issue, as the former Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen&#8217;s Caucus, I want to make sure all my fellow sportsmen in South Carolina see THIS announcement from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources on a new regulation established for use of natural deer lures and attractants in our state.&nbsp;  It is an honor to serve as your Representative in Congress. Please know the voice of the Third District of South Carolina is well heard in Washington.

It is also a point of deep personal pride that I am one of just 14 naturalized citizens currently serving in Congress.  I am pleased to give you an update on my work in Congress to fight for the needs and values of our district and to help advance bold, transformative change nationwide.  INVESTING IN OUR DISTRICT This summer, I secured significant investments to support our district&#8217;s needs. I led and passed amendments to increase funding for transitional housing and homelessness services, Permanent Supportive Housing, noise mitigation and restorative justice programs. I will continue fighting for essential funding for our district, whether that is tax rebates to keep the Port of Seattle competitive, or grants to support salmon restoration, or funding to develop an earthquake early warning system.        *Robert Mueller testifying to the House Judiciary Committee    HOLDING THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE I was one of the first Members of the House to call for an impeachment inquiry into whether the President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. And as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, I am on the frontlines of the impeachment investigation to hold the President accountable. No one is above the law.  FIGHTING FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS As a long-time advocate for immigration reform and one of just 14 naturalized citizens currently serving in Congress, and the vice chair of the Judiciary Committee's Immigration Subcommittee, I worked to ensure passage of H.R.6, the American Dream and Promise Act, to protect and provide a roadmap to citizenship for people who are American in every single way but on paper. I was the first member to go into a prison to meet with parents separated from their children, accompany asylum seekers across the border and observe the due process violations in court under the administration's policy forcing immigrants to remain in Mexico. I will continue to fight for immigrants by taking on the administration's asylum ban and family separation and border policies.       *Representative Jayapal at Medicare for All Press Conference    LEADING ON MEDICARE FOR ALL This year, I introduced H.R.1384, the Medicare for All Act of 2019. The legislation provides comprehensive health care coverage and gives patients the freedom to choose their doctors, hospitals and other providers they wish &#150; without premiums, co-pays or deductibles. This bill already has 118 cosponsors, and we&#8217;ve held historic, first-ever hearings on Medicare for All in the House Rules, Budget and Ways and Means Committees.        *National Domestic Workers Alliance at press conference    PROTECTING DOMESTIC WORKERS I am the author of the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act, a comprehensive, visionary and worker-driven bill to protect the two million* domestic workers who go to work in people&#8217;s homes across the U.S. every day. These workers care for children, clean homes and support the independence of people with disabilities but face high levels of wage theft, workplace injury, sexual harassment and trafficking. This bill was crafted based in part on historic legislation from our district that ensured domestic workers are heard by creating a domestic worker wage and standards board.  *According to the Economic Policy Institute  BRINGING SEATTLE VALUES TO THE OTHER WASHINGTON I am proud to represent a district that has led the country with bold thinking and solutions. I have sponsored critically important measures to protect our environment, including H.R.9, the Climate Action Now Act, and H.Res.109, a Green New Deal. Having served on the committee that drafted Seattle&#8217;s historic $15 minimum wage bill, I fought in Congress to pass the Raise the Wage Act of 2019. As the proud mom of a gender non-conforming child, I have fought for LGBTQ equality by serving as Vice Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, voting for the Equality Act, and opposing what I believe are the administration's efforts to demonize and scapegoat transgender Americans.   In working towards a more just and equal society, I have hosted numerous town halls and roundtable meetings across our district so that you can raise your concerns, learn what actions Congress is taking to serve you and discuss what lies ahead as we continue the fight for justice. With your engagement, I&#8217;m proud to say we are continuing to make our 7th District stronger than ever.

That&#8217;s why I hosted dozens of community events during the August district work period&#151;to hear from people like you, so that I can advocate for the issues our community values. At townhalls and Coffee with Katie events, I heard directly from members of our community who told me they&#8217;re concerned that we aren&#8217;t doing enough to protect our environment. I participated in a roundtable with environmental advocates at the San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary, a constructed wetland right here in the 45th District. We discussed the urgent need for Congressional action on climate, including reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and curbing offshore oil drilling to protect our coastline.   I&#8217;m pleased to share that I&#8217;ve joined my House colleagues to take concrete actions to address climate change. We passed three bills that would ban new offshore drilling and development, including along our beautiful California coasts. With vibrant beaches in Orange County just a short drive from our district, protecting our water and air is a top priority of mine in Congress. We must protect our environment for our children, for our culture of outdoor recreation, and for our local businesses that rely on tourism. &nbsp;&nbsp; This is an important step, but it&#8217;s not enough. Earlier this year, I introduced the Clean Corridors Act of 2019 with fellow California Representatives Harley Rouda and Mark DeSaulnier. This law would establish a program to install electric and hydrogen fueling stations along our nation&#8217;s highways and help lower carbon emissions. With over 21,000 clean jobs and a top-notch public university in our district, investments in clean technology through legislation like the Clean Corridors Act benefit both our environment and our local economy. I&#8217;ve toured local businesses here in the 45th District such as esVolta, an energy storage company with a facility in Irvine. esVolta stores excess energy for later use and discharges the stored energy when demand outpaces supply. Energy storage is a key piece of maintaining the electricity grid and will help us better harness green technologies.   Our district is also home to incredible clean technology innovation, which I was honored to recognize in a bipartisan-supported amendment to the Climate Action Now Act. That legislation would keep the international commitment we made to fighting climate change in the Paris Climate Agreement. I was proud to vote in favor of the Climate Action Now Act as it passed the House. In addition, I&#8217;ve helped introduce a bill that would block the Trump Administration&#8217;s harmful attempts to gut the Endangered Species Act and roll back federal protections that help preserve our local wildlife. During my environmental roundtable, I was able to learn about wildlife corridors in the 45th District, which allow wildlife to travel across freeways and developments to get to other open spaces. As a member of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Caucus, I am committed to continuing this conversation on ways we can protect the environment and preserve our many beautiful landscapes and ecosystems. Climate change is real, and as your Representative in Congress, I will continue to lead the charge to stop it.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very truly yours, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Representative Katie Porter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member of Congress                          ","district":"45","title":"Representative","gender":"F","state":"CA","party":"Democrat","score":4.002037},{"name":"Senator Martin Heinrich","address":"donotreply@heinrich.senate.gov","timestamp":"2019-09-23","subject":"Young Climate Activists Are Catalyst For Change","body":"September 23, 2019 Dear Friend, Last week I spoke at a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol with climate activist Greta Thunberg. She came to Washington demanding Congress take action on the climate crisis. Greta was accompanied by an international delegation of youth climate activists. It included indigenous tribal members from the Amazon who have seen their rainforests ravaged by fires and students from all across America. Every year our planet gets hotter, droughts last longer, and in New Mexico, wildfires burn for weeks. The longevity, damage and costs of these fires was nearly unimaginable just a few decades ago. I've spent my entire adult life working to protect some of the wildest public lands in New Mexico-places I truly love. I've seen them change in the face of a warming planet. I've spent decades working to build a renewable energy economy. But the progress that we've made simply hasn't kept pace with the speed and the scale of the warming that threatens our very existence. VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich Backs Green New Deal, Says Young Climate Activists Are Catalyst For Change, September 20, 2019. That's why I announced last week that I am signing on to the Green New Deal. I'm supporting a Green New Deal because the rising generation of activists understands what we're up against, and is willing to advocate for the kind of bold changes that equal the scale of the climate crisis. We can no longer afford to be in denial or cautious in the face of the greatest challenge or our time. I stand in solidarity with all the students and young leaders in New Mexico and around the world who are who are demanding action on climate. They are the most powerful tool that we have to make this right.

Not only should he be impeached, he should have been impeached some time ago. And while the President should be held accountable for his misdeeds, we must not forget that the framers of the Constitution provided Congress the ultimate remedy for an out-of-control president, who abuses his power with obstruction and by infusing bigotry into policy, harmful to society.  &#8220;We are at the crossroads of accountability. At some point, Congress must hold President Trump accountable or Congress will be held accountable. The longer we wait, the greater the likelihood that Congress will be held accountable for failure to hold President Trump accountable.

As seen in Stars and Stripes  U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and several Air Medals to former Aviation Machinist Mate First Class Bernard B. Bartusiak of Palos Hills for meritorious service involving aerial flight during World War II. The ceremony took place at the Secretary of the Navy?s office inside the Pentagon and was attended by Bartusiak, his relatives, and Congressman Lipinski, who helped Bartusiak claim his medals after meeting him at a senior fair the congressman hosted. The Distinguished Flying Cross is a U.S. Military Decoration awarded to a member of the Armed Forces who distinguishes himself or herself in support of operations by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight. Bartusiak, 95, was part of the aircrew on a PB4Y Liberator aircraft in the European Theater of World War II. ?Mr. Bartusiak?s sacrifice and dedication to our country are an inspiration to us all,? said Congressman Lipinski. ?He is a man who defended our country at a time of tremendous need. It was my sincere privilege to help him obtain the medals he had rightfully earned for his service and bravery in WWII. After the ceremony, Bernard made me the 11th Honorary Member of Crew 57. It is an honor I will never forget.? If you?re a veteran or a family member of a veteran who needs help obtaining service medals, please contact Congressman Lipinski?s office at (773) 948-6223. Lipinski Helps Beverly Woman Receive Green Card After Government Errors ? As seen in the Chicago Sun-Times  Congressman Lipinski celebrated Corina Turcinovic receiving her green card earlier this month after she was ordered to be deported in March. Lipinski has been an integral part of Corina?s path to citizenship since 2007 when he stopped her deportation as she was headed to O?Hare Airport. Corina?s immigration problems all stemmed from a series of government errors when her late husband was on his way to becoming a citizen. Lipinski filed numerous private bills on Corina?s behalf in the years that followed, including one in May to naturalize her immigration status. ?I was beyond elated when Corina shared the news that she had secured her green card. It?s hard to believe I?ve been working on this case with her for more than 13 years through three different administrations and helped stop her deportation twice. There was no reason for Corina to be targeted, especially when the government made a mistake with the citizenship application of Corina?s late husband. Allowing Corina to stay in the country and continue to be a productive member of society is the right thing to do. As Corina would attest, it?s important for immigrants to be persistent and to contact their representative who may be able to help.?
