"U.S. House removes ERA ratification deadline, one obstacle to enactment By Patricia Sullivan, The Washington Post                                                          The 232-to-183 vote, on a resolution introduced by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), pushes the issue to the Senate, where Sens."
and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have introduced a similar measure.
"During debate on the House floor, Republicans leaned on antiabortion and constitutional arguments to oppose the ERA, arguing that enshrining protections for women in the Constitution would mean abortion could not be restricted."
Democrats focused on the legality of deadlines and the importance of equal rights.
This has nothing to do with the abortion issue.
"That is an excuse, not a reason, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that women are still paid less than men for similar work, and often are shorted on pensions and maternity leaves."

"Playing on Kansas City Radio: Russian Propaganda                                                          By Neil MacFarquhar, The New York Times When commuters spin the radio dial as they drive through Kansas City, Mo., these days, between the strains of classic rock and country hits they can tune in to something unexpected: Russian agitprop."
"In January, Radio Sputnik, a propaganda arm of the Russian government, started broadcasting on three Kansas City-area radio stations during prime drive times, even sharing one frequency with a station rooted in the citys historic jazz district."
"Who needs a ridiculous Red Dawn invasion, a participant in one online forum wrote about the new broadcasts."
"Your overlord, Mr. Putin, will be addressing you soon, so its best to prepare now, another commenter wrote, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia."
"In the United States, talk radio on Sputnik covers the political spectrum from right to left, but the constant backbeat is that America is damaged goods."

We Knew They Had Cooked the Books The Trump administrations attempt to kill one of Americas strongest climate policies has been a complete debacle.
"By Robinson Meyer, The Atlantic  They had made the same call dozens of times before."
"For nearly a decade, the EPA team had worked closely with another group of engineers in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, pronounced nits-uh) to write the federal tailpipe-pollution standards, one of the most consequential climate protections in American history."
"The two teams had done virtually all the technical researchtesting engines in a lab, interviewing scientists and automakers, and overseeing complex economic simulationsunderpinning the rules, which have applied to every new car and light truck, including SUVs and vans, sold in the United States since 2012."
Their collaboration was historic.
"Even as SUVs, crossovers, and pickups have gobbled up the new-car market, the rules have pushed the average fuel economythe distance a vehicle can travel per gallon of gasto record highs."
"They have saved Americans $500 billion at the pump, according to the nonpartisan Consumer Federation of America, and kept hundreds of millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air."
"So as the call connected, Alson and the other EPA engineers thought it was time to get back to work."
Donald Trump had recently ordered a review of the rules.

A Group of Agents Rose Through the Ranks to Lead the Border Patrol.
Theyre Leaving It in Crisis.
"How several agents from a small outpost in Arizona, including recently retired chief Carla Provost, climbed to the top of the Border Patrol, then one by one retired, leaving corruption, misconduct and a toxic culture in their wake."
"By Melissa del Bosque, ProPublica  The party was adorned with a whos who in Border Patrol leadership, past and present."
"There was the unmistakable figure of Lucks boss, Chief Carla Provost, tall and broad with her trademark fringe of brown bangs, and her longtime friend Andrea Zortman, who helps oversee foreign operations for the agency."
"A full contingent of retired former chiefs-turned-consultants were on hand, too, including David Aguilar, 64, whod headed the Border Patrol as well as its parent, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Michael Fisher, 55, whod succeeded Aguilar as Border Patrol chief."
"Rowdy Adams, 59, another retired senior-level CBP official, also attended the celebration."
"The guests had kicked in $75 apiece to cover food and a gift for the send-off, but hovering over the party was a mix of weariness and defiance: It wasnt just the end of Lucks career, it was the end of an era at the agency  their era."
"And the widespread critiques currently pummeling the embattled patrol and its more than 19,600 agents would be, implicitly, their legacy."
"  News fromCongressman Steve Cohen                             Website  Serving You  Legislative Work  Our District  Resources               February 14, 2020      Dear Friend,This week, I voted for,and the House passed,a measure to advance the Equal Rights Amendment toward ratification as the 28thAmendment to the U.S. Constitution."
"I also helped introduce and spoke in favor of a comprehensive measure to limit plastic pollution and make the plastics industrytake responsibilityfor the cleanup ofthe wasteful products it produces;joined my Judiciary Committee colleagues in announcing an investigation into the politicization of the Department of Justice;wrote to the CEO of Amtrak asking for a credible rationale for its changes in food service; reacted to the release of the Presidents heartless budget proposal; made information about temporary jobs with the U.S. Census Bureau available; introduced the MEAL Act; reminded constituents of my firstCongress On Your Cornerevent of the year on February 28; and offered a heart-healthy Valentines Day-related health tip.Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me onTwitter, Facebook and Instagram to see more updates as they happen."

Passage was one more step toward making the Equal Rights Amendment the 28thAmendment to the U.S. Constitution and eliminating discrimination based on sex.
"Before the vote, I spoke from the House floor in favor of the measure."
"See my release on the vote, and my speech, here."
"On Monday, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, I testified before the House Rules Committee, urging it to adopt a rule for consideration of the measure."
See my release and the testimony here.
"Helping Introduce and Cosponsoring the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act   On Wednesday, I helped introduce the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act."
"This comprehensive measure would phase out some single-use plastic products, incentivize consumers to recycle by creating a national 10-cent refund program for all beverage containers, require plastic producers to design and finance programs to collect waste, and reform our broken waste and recycling collection system."
See my release and my remarks atthepress conference rolling out the measure here.
"Investigating the Politicization of the Department of Justice   On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve as a senior member, announced that Attorney General William Barr would testify before the Committee in March to address concerns regarding his leadership and the politicization of the Department of Justice (DOJ)."
President Trump has repeatedly pressured the DOJ to pursue his political enemies and help his allies who have committed serious crimes.
This undermines the rule of law and threatens our national values.
Read the Committees press release here.
See my interview with CNNs Poppy Harlow on the situation here.
"Demanding Credible Evidence from Amtrak CEO on Food Service Changes   Also Wednesday, as a senior member of the House Transportationand Infrastructure CommitteesSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, I wrote to Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson to ask for credible evidenceto supporthis decision to suspend dining car food service on some long-distance routes."

"Reacting to the Presidents Harmful Budget Proposal  On Monday, President Trump released a destructive budget proposal that prioritizes special interests and the rich and powerful over the health, safety, and economic security of American families."
"For example, the Trump budget cuts $1.6 trillion from health care programs over 10 years."
"This includes a more than $900 billion cut to Medicaid, a half a trillion-dollar cut to Medicare, and more than $200 billion in cuts to other health programs."
It would also cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and critical research dollars for cures for catastrophic diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
It would also cut Social Security benefits by $24 billion -- despite the Presidents previous claims he would leave Social Security alone -- and $292 billion over 10 years from mandatory programs that support working families.
The federal budget should be a statement of values.
Once again the President is showing just how little he values the well-being of hard-working Americans.
House Democrats will reject this heartless budget.
"Making Information about U.S. Census Jobs Available    Every ten years, the U.S. Census Bureau counts the number of people living in the United States for the purpose of reapportioning the U.S. House of Representatives 435 seats among the 50 states."
That requires a huge temporary workforce.
"Hundreds of thousands of jobs are now available for Census field supervisors, Census takers, clerks and other positions."
"In Shelby County, the pay ranges between $20 and $22 per hour with reimbursement for mileage and expenses."
"To qualify, you must be at least 18, have a valid Social Security number, a valid email address and pass a criminal background check."
"Introducing the MEAL Act  On Friday, I introduced the Making Essentials Affordable and Lawful (MEAL) Act to lift restriction on the receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)for people with priordrugfelony convictions, ensuring that they can meet their basic needs as soon as they reenter society."

"            February 14, 2020               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Passing Bill Increasing the Number of Agricultural Specialists for U.S. Customs and Border Protection  This week, I voted in favor of the Protecting Americas Food and Agriculture Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored."
"This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year."
This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model.
It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference.
"In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area."
I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our countrys food and agriculture interests.
"Read more here,  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products."
"The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient."
"This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products."
"Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store."
"Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as milk."
I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law.
"Dropping the Puck in Glens Falls to Stick It to Cancer and Helping Kids Learn to Skate   This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the community ""Try Hockey for Free"" event in Glens Falls, where I helped introduce many young constituentsto the sport of hockey."
This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game.
"NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!"
"Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce."
It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing.
"In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease."
"I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases."
I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.
"I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army."
"We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards."
I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act.
I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress.
"Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events."
The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees.
This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires.
"Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance."
"This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base."
"Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving onour embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts."
This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted.
"As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical."
Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders.
"Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots."
We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and Im honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress.
Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown.
"The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities."
"Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns."
"Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities."
I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.
"Writing an Op-Ed Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Miracle on Ice  This week, I wrote an op-ed commemorating the 40th anniversary of the iconic Miracle on Ice and celebrating the North Countrys rich Olympic history."
The op-ed was published inThe Sunthis week.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:    ___________________  Featured Read:  Times Union:State, federal lawmakers clash over access to DMV records  U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for ""absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies"" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases."
"Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines  though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks."
"""New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,"" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon."
"""They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens."""

"5863, the Student Loan Marriage Penalty Elimination Act."
This legislation addresses growing student loan debt by making the student loan interest tax deduction work better for married couples.
Current law penalizes married couples by only allowing them to take one deductioneven if both spouses qualify.
This bill would stop this unfair tax on student loans against married couples while also helping individuals with their student loan debt burden.
"For decades, hardworking Americans have been saddled with student loan debt which has delayed their dreams of achieving financial stability."
I am proud to lead this effort to maximize the student loan interest tax deduction that married couples can claim each tax year.
"This allows married couples to put more towards paying off their student loans, incur less interest, put more food on the table, or save a little more for a down payment on a home."
"This unfair marriage penalty came to my attention after Claudia McHale, a constituent from Garden City, discussed with me the situation of her niece and her husband."
"Both of them paid towards reducing their student loan yet were only able to claim a $2,500 deduction between the two of them, the same maximum amount a single individual can claim every tax year."
"As Claudia said, it is ridiculous that the federal government punishes taxpayers with student loan balances just because they get married."
"__________  On Tuesday, I received the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council."
"This recognition is awarded to Members of Congress with a proven record of defending the right to life, religious freedoms, and family values."
It is truly an honor to represent Missouri's 4th congressional district as we fight for our foundational values.
"Legislative Update On Thursday, Democrat leadership in the House attempted resurrect the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) through Congress."
"I commend the women who have gone before us, to celebrate the achievements women have made, and to reaffirm the fact that we are already equal in the eyes of God and in law."
"Women make up 51% of the population, comprise over half of college students, make up most of todays medical and law school students, and own the majority of new businesses."
"Little girls can be whatever they want to be whether that be an astronaut, a doctor, a full-time mom working at home, or a Member of Congress."
"In addition, federal law and court precedent uphold our rights."
That is something to applaud and I do.
"However, todays legislation is problematic on several fronts."
"First, the resolution is unconstitutional."
The time limit to pass the ERA expired decades ago.
Congress cant go back and remove a deadline from a previous constitutional amendment initiative.
"The Supreme Court has recognized that the 1972 ERA expired, and the Department of Justice issued a ruling saying, Congress may not revive a proposed amendment after a deadline for its ratification has expired."
Pretending we can remove the time limits for passage is both futile and deceptive.
"Secondly, if the time limit COULD be extended, the ERA would not bring women any more rights than they currently have but it would entrench the legality of abortion."
We know this from court precedent and by listening to those who have the most to gain from constitutionally protecting abortion on demand.
"In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Rights Amendment in their state constitution requires state-funding of abortions."
Federal courts are likely to do the same.
Perhaps this is why every major pro-abortion organization is endorsing passage of the ERA.
"NARAL Pro-Choice America says: With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion."
National Organization for Women: An ERAproperly interpretedcould negate the hundreds of laws that have been passed restricting access to abortion care.
But thats not the only concern with passing this resolution.
"Besides being unconstitutional and shredding state and federal pro-life protections, the ERA would also erase decades of progress which have provided opportunities for women, advanced womens progress through federal programs, and secured necessary protections for women and girls."
"By incorporating gender identity in the definition of sex, jeopardizing private spaces for women, girls sports programs, and womens educational institutions."
"By banning distinctions between men and women, the ERA also endangers laws, programs and funding designed to benefit women."
"The ERA provides a pathway for legal challenges to welfare programs, grants for battered womens shelters, efforts to bolster women participating in STEM programs."
These outcomes of the ERA are anything but pro-woman.
"I urge my colleagues to vote No on todays resolution and uphold the Constitution, promote life, and protect womens rights that have been so hard-fought gained."
District Update I am so pleased to tell you about an honor recently won by Columbia Public Schools.
"Project Tomorrow is a national education nonprofit dedicated to ensuring thattodays students are well prepared to be tomorrows innovators, leaders, and engaged citizens of the world."
"Project Tomorrow is recognizing Columbia Public Schools with its annual Speak Up District of Honor award, an honor given to school districts for leadership and commitment to listening to the voices and views of students, parents, and educators."
I believe it is through these valuable exchanges that better learning experiences are created for students from kindergarten through the 12th grade.
Congratulations to Columbia Public Schools for earning this distinction and for its dedication to improving and enhancing the educational experience for its students.
"Constituent Update I want to share with you that our office has joined forces with the Library of Congress to help preserve, forever, the stories of our veterans."
"The Veterans History Project began as an effort to collect the accounts of Americas World War II heroes, many of whom are passing away without their stories being saved for posterity."
It has since expanded to veterans of all military encounters with the goal of ensuring their personal memories are recorded and made available for future generations.

"Pathway to Peace This week, I introduced a package of seven bills that outline a bold progressive vision to reimagines the countrys approach to foreign policy as one that centers human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of Americas engagement in the world, and makes military action a last resort."
I have firsthand experience with how destructive war can beand I see how our continuous involvement in foreign conflicts is not making our country or our world any safer.
"I believe that when the United States says it champions human rights, democracy, and peace, we should mean it."
Eritrean Asylum ENSURE Act This administration will stop at nothing to make life painful for people of color seeking a better future.
"Not only has the President added Eritrea to its latest Muslim Ban, but he is also now threatening to deport Eritreans who have settled here."
Thats why I introduced the ENSURE Act to stop the United States from deporting Eritreans fleeing state oppression.
"The bill places a two-year stay on removals; prohibits the detention of Eritrean nationals during removal procedures; and, requires up-to-date reporting on Eritreans facing imminent removal."
"The PRO Act As a former union member myself, I can attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right to organize."
"Thats why we need the PRO Act, which puts power back in the hands of workers where it belongs."
"It will address the challenges and attacks that labor unions have been facing for decades that have led to the erosion of wages, a spike in workplace discrimination, and dangerous growth in inequality."
Unions dont only raise wages.
"They create working class solidarity between workers across gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."
"Trump Budget This week, the Budget Committee held a hearing on President Trumps latest spending proposals."
"The administration's new budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stampswhile continuing the Presidents disastrous tax breaks for the rich and while increasing wasteful spending on endless wars."
"We need a budget for the people that invests in housing, education, healthcare, and addressing the climate crisis, not a budget that benefits billionaires like the President."
"                               This week, Senator Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio introduced a resolution honoring the 17 victims of the senseless attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018."
The resolution passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent.
"Senator Rick Scott said, Today marks two years since the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."
"Not a day goes by that I dont think about the 17 lives we lost far too soon, and Im proud to introduce this resolution honoring them with Senator Rubio."
"Over the past two years, Ive worked closely with the families of the victims to make our schools safer and prevent future tragedies."
"We passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act while I was Governor and now Im fighting for improvements on the federal level, including the Luke and Alex School Safety Act."
"While our hearts are still heavy with loss we cannot undo, we must do everything in our power to honor the memory of the victims and ensure no family has to go through this pain again."

"While General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi claims that his goal is to improve relations between our two countries, his actions send another message."
"If hes serious about working with the United States to improve our relationship, he should immediately extradite the military officials that were charged by the Justice Department for the Equifax breach in 2017."
"If General Security Xi and Communist China fail to do so, it will just be another sign that their promise of improved economic and political relations was more empty rhetoric from an adversary intent on competing with the United States on a global scale.Read more HERE."
"Sen. Rick Scott Questions Pandemic Experts on Efforts to Protect Americans from Coronavirus  During a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs roundtable on global pandemics, Senator Rick Scott questioned experts regarding the threat of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus."
Senator Scott continues to work with the administration to protect the health of American families.Watch video from the roundtable HERE or below.
"Sen. Rick Scott Introduces the Medical License Verification Act  Senators Rick Scott, John Cornyn, Chris Van Hollen and Catherine Cortez Masto introduced the Medical License Verification Act to prevent fraud in the healthcare system by requiring the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) to verify that an applicants medical license is valid and in good standing prior to issuing them a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, which is required by healthcare providers to bill for insurance."
"Under current law, CMS issues NPI numbers without verification of the licensure information submitted, which allows non-physicians to obtain NPI numbers and opens up the possibility that they may fraudulently bill commercial health insurance."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Under our current system, loopholes exist that have allowed non-doctors to fraudulently bill health insurance companies to the tune of millions of dollars, which ultimately gets passed along to the consumer."
This is unfair and it has to stop.
The Medical License Verification Act is a small and commonsense step to address this weakness and prevent bad actors from defrauding families.Read more HERE.
"Sen. Rick Scott Joins Sen.

Government has determined to be a national security threat and continues to be a bad actor across the globe.
"U.S. exports to Huawei have been banned, but some U.S. companies are finding ways around the blacklisting, including supplying Huawei through subsidiaries or partners in foreign countries."
"Senator Rick Scott said, We know Huawei is supported and controlled by the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights and steal our data, technology, and intellectual property."
"Companiesin the United States should not be allowed to sell to Huawei, and my legislation will further restrict their ability."

"              -->               Dear friends and neighbors,  Yesterday, President Trump released his budget for Fiscal Year 2021, and his proposals are just another example of his complete disregard for the well-being of working class Americans in Central Florida."
"He is cutting $1.6 Trillion from YOUR Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs."
"Not only does his budget contradict his statements at last Tuesdays State of the Union, it backtracks on promises he has made over and over again."
"Instead of using his budget to fund critical programs that are working for Floridians, like you, President Trump is:   Cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security: President Trump has broken his promises to seniors and families by slashing half a trillion dollars from Medicare, taking $900 billion from the lifeline of Medicaid, and cutting Social Security Disability Insurance."
"Hurting students: The Trump Budget cuts federal student loan initiatives by $170 billion, eliminates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness initiative, and harms children in Central Floridas public schools by cutting billions from the Department of Education."
"Abandoning farmers and hungry families: While Central Florida farmers are declaring bankruptcy at record rates, the Trump Budget slashes nearly $60 billion from the farmer safety net and steals more than $180 billion in nutrition assistance from families struggling to keep food on the table."
"Just in Central Florida, there are over 200,000 residents using SNAP to put food on the table that otherwise they would not be able to do."
"Cutting investments in jobs and the future of our communities: The Trump Budget breaks last years bipartisan budget agreement by slashing a total of $1.6 trillion dollars in the health, education, safety and global security of Central Floridians."
Contributing to the national debtby extending the GOP Tax Scam for the rich.
Make no mistake  I will continue to work with House Democrats to stand firm against the Presidents broken promises and keep fighting for ALL Americans.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
"       A Message from the Congresswoman Dear Friend,  This week, the Trump Administration released its proposed budget for the next year."
"It comes as no surprise that the proposed budget is devoid of compassion and empathy, and proposes massive cuts to education programs, housing programs, and critical social safety net programs like Medicare and Medicaid."
"Budgets are statements of our values, and Im committed to ensuring that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 federal budget affirms equity and justice for all across our district and our country."
"Now that the FY 2021 Budget proposal has been released, Congress will begin its appropriations work to develop funding bills that reflect the values of the people."
What is the appropriations process?
"To determine how federal dollars get spent, Congress conducts an appropriations process every year."
"The appropriations process determines how much federal funding goes to government agencies and programs - everything from our schools, to our hospitals, to major infrastructure projects."
"Too often, though, the appropriations process takes place behind closed doors."
Decisions about how to spend valuable resources are made with little to no input from our communities.
"Last year, hundreds of advocates and constituents engaged with our office on appropriations priorities, ensuring that those closest to the pain are closest to the power - driving and performing policy making."
How can I be involved?
"The appropriations process for FY 2021 is officially underway, and I am seeking your partnership as I work to advocate for the federal resources and programs that serve our communities across the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District."
"If you or your organization would like to advocate for a certain federal program, you can submit an appropriations request through this form."
"The deadline for submissions is Friday, February 28th at 5:00pm EST."
"Last year, we were able to secure millions of dollars for federal programs that support community based violence prevention, school based health centers and healthy food options in schools and other critical youth programs."
Im grateful for your partnership and I look forward to working together to ensure that our federal budget reflects the values we espouse in the Massachusetts 7th.
"Together, we can secure robust federal resources critical to addressing the issues of consequence for communities across our district and the across the nation."

"                        CONTACT  MEDIA                Dear Friend,  This week, the White House formally released the President's budget proposal for FY 2021."
Ordinarily this would begin the annual process of reconciling the administration's budget with that of Congress.
"However, House Democrats failed to even propose a budget last year."
"They refuse to propose a budget and begin the process of negotiating how the federal government should allocate its resources because their socialist agenda would make everything  from health care, to college, and more  government-provided, devastating the nation."
"Also, the Ways and Means Committee held a mark-up this week on bipartisan legislation to address the issue of surprise medical billing."
Continuing reading to learn more about this important piece of legislation.
Addressing Surprise Medical Billing The Ways and Means Committee held a markup on a bipartisan piece of legislation dealing with surprise medical billing.
"I would like to thank Chairman Neal (D-MA) and Ranking Member Brady (R-TX) for their dedicated work on this thoughtful piece of legislation that protects patients and brings providers, insurers, and hospitals to the table to share in the responsibility of fixing this issue."
"As a practicing dentist, I cant emphasize enough that we need to have a balanced approach to expand provider networks, not shrink them."
"Our bill makes sure that patients come first, but is also fair to both provides and payers in determining a solution."
"While no solution is perfect, I believe out framework is the best approach to the issue of surprised medical bills and a step in the right direction."

"Do you support this policy which is now the prevailing position of Congressional Democrats/Presidential candidates?"""
"In response to this survey, 88% said they do not support ""Medicare for All"", while 12%of Third District respondents answered that they did."
"I also asked: ""President Trump recently announced Phase One of the China trade agreement along with signing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement."
"As he looks to pursue free trade agreements with the U.K., EU, and Kenya, do you support the Presidents trade agenda? """
"In response to this survey, 90% of Third District respondents answered they do support the President's trade agenda, while 10% answered that they did not."

"As always, it is an honor to serve all of you in Georgia's Third District!"
"Senator for Oregon  Dear *First Name*, For a president who makes himself out to be a champion of typical working Americans, Donald Trump has run the same old Republican playbook of giving tax handouts to the wealthy and slashing the safety net that supports everybody else."
"He started this con with his 2016 campaign promises not to touch Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and now he wants to cut them by more than $1.5 trillion.?"
"Bottom line, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will be on the chopping block as long as Donald Trump is president."
"Trump?s not only trying to slash safety net programs critical to Oregonians, he?s once again threatening to sell off Bonneville Power and raise monthly utility bills for Oregon families and businesses."
Too many families in Oregon are already balancing the food bill against the utility bill and do not need the administration to come in like a wrecking ball and make things worse.
This misguided scheme would be felt by everybody in the Northwest.
Oregonians see through this Trump double-talk.
Trump?s thoughts are not with the good of the country.
"They?re for the wealthy and, as always, himself.?"
"As part of my commitment to hear directly from Oregonians, I?m hosting four town halls in the coming days ."
"I encourage you to come and make your voice heard if you think Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security should be on Trump?s chopping block.????????"
"Sincerely,    Please do not reply to this e-mail."

"Concluding the Senate Impeachment Trial On Wednesday, the Senate Impeachment Trial concluded after votes on both Articles of Impeachment."
"Both articles failed to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove a President from office, with 48-52 and 47-53 votes respectively."
"When I took the oath at the beginning of this trial, I vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law."
I took this oath and responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until I heard arguments from both the House managers and President Trumps lawyers.
"After hearing from both sides and asking multiple questions  , I voted no on conviction and removal of the president."
I came to this conclusion after three major considerations.
"First, in order to avoid a system of government where the president serves at the political pleasure of Congress, the Framers intended impeachment and removal to be reserved for extreme and rare situations."
The alleged facts contained in the articles and presented by the impeachment managers do not rise to this level.
"Second, the House failed in its prosecutorial role by not presenting specific statutory charges against the president."
Our Constitution demands of the justice system that prosecutors bring specific charges and prove each element of those charges beyond a reasonable doubt.
"In this case, neither of the articles passed by the House contain statutory allegations to which the Senate could determine whether the elements for conviction were met."
"On the floor, the House managers argued that the statutory crime of bribery was contained in the first Article of Impeachment related to abuse of power."
"In addition to the fact that there is no evidence in the record that satisfies the statutory elements of bribery, the Senate cannot substitute its own charges or charges made by House managers on the floor for those contained within the House-passed Articles of Impeachment."
"Third, the House failed to meet its evidentiary burden and attempted to shift that burden to the Senate."
"Unwilling to give the judicial system the time to answer important questions of executive privilege in regards to specific witnesses that the House managers claimed were key to the case, the House moved forward with impeachment."
The House managers argued at the beginning of the trial that they had overwhelming evidence supporting impeachment.
It was surprising then that the House managers attempted to burden the Senate with issuing subpoenas and taking testimony from those witnesses that the House failed to pursue.
"Regardless, additional evidence or witnesses would not change the material underlying facts describing the presidents actions."
"These actions are not high crimes and misdemeanors as described by the Constitution, and therefore, I voted no  on conviction and removal of the president."
"Supporting the Presidents State of the Union Priorities On Tuesday evening, President Trump delivered the State of the Union  , offering Congress and the American people the opportunity to hear directly from the President of the United States regarding his vision for Americas future."
"I was pleased the president discussed trade, our economy, STEM education, and support for our military and veterans."
President Trump highlighted accomplishments have hopefully made on establishing fairer trade with China and signing the historic United States Mexico-Canada Agreement.
New trade opportunities will help provide Kansas farmers and manufacturers with markets to sell their products around the world.
"As Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with President Trump to pass and implement policies that prioritize veterans and ensure they receive the care they deserve."
"I was honored to bring veteran and Kansas Representative Chris Croft to the State of the Union as my guest, and I appreciate the president hosting a number of veterans to the State of the Union as his guests to honor their service and the success they have achieved after service."
President Trump also conveyed his wish for Congress to fully fund NASAs Artemis program.
"As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science."
"I am committed to ensuring NASA has the necessary resources for our country to once again put Americans on the moon, furthering our national security and scientific priorities."
I look forward to working with President Trump and the administration on the many issues discussed to deliver positive results for Kansans and all Americans.
"Hosting Kansas Representative Chris Croft I invited  Kansas Representative Chris Croft, who represents the 8th district in Overland Park to the U.S. Capitol as my guest at the State of the Union."
He is both a veteran and an advocate for veterans in his role as a Kansas representative.
He served in the U.S. Army for 30 years and after retiring as a Colonel was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives.
"Rep. Croft is dedicated to his country, to Kansas and to our nations veterans, and I was honored to have him join me at the State of the Union as my guest."
"During his time in the Army, Rep. Croft served in Iraq and was selected as the executive director for the Center for Army Leadership at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas."
"In that role, he helped create the Armys first leader development manual and assisted U.S. allies around the world to establish their own leadership centers."
He received the distinction as the longest-serving director of the Armys Leadership Center.
"After retiring from the Army, Rep. Croft continued his service by running for the Kansas House of Representatives."
He was elected as the representative for the 8th district in 2018 and was selected to serve on the Veteran and Military Affairs Committee.
Croft is working to pass legislation to help establish a new home for veterans in northeast Kansas.
Thank you to Rep. Croft for joining me.
"Chairing a Hearing on the VA Community Care Network On Wednesday, I convened my first hearing  as Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee."
"The focus was providing oversight to the VAs efforts to implement the Community Care Network (CCN), a component of the VA MISSION Act."
This legislation directed the VA to create a network of community providers as an alternative for veterans when the VA is unable to provide timely or quality care.
"While we are still in the early stages of network deployment, the committee took the opportunity to have a discussion about the CCN with the VA, the companies responsible for building this network and other stakeholders."
"I shared my concerns regarding network adequacy and pushed the VA to use uniform access standards throughout the CCN, which will make it easier for veterans to receive community care."
The CCN will go live in Kansas next month and a robust network will be vital to guarantee our rural veterans receive timely healthcare.
"In my opening statement, I noted how Kansas Big First Congressional District is as large as the State of Illinois, but lacks a VA Medical Center."
"For veterans in rural areas, MISSIONs Community Care Network is essential for timely healthcare."
"As Chairman, I will continue to hold oversight hearings to make certain veterans are receiving the care and benefits they deserve."
Discussing Solutions to World Hunger and Development Issues I was pleased to join World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley and United States Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) leadership on Tuesday for a discussion about solutions to global hunger and development issues.
"As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus and member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture and State and Foreign Operations, hunger and development issues are some of my top priorities in the Senate."
"International food aid and development programs provide many benefits to Americans, including preventing violence and unrest overseas and markets for the commodities produced by Kansas farmers and ranchers."
"This discussion focused on solutions to these important problems, including what Congress should be focusing on in the future."
I look forward to continuing to work with my Senate colleagues on alleviating these global issues.
Pictured below is President and CEO of the U.S.
"Global Leadership Coalition Liz Schrayer, Executive Directory Beasley and Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.)."
"Speaking at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting On Tuesday, I was honored to speak at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C."
I spoke about trade and the challenges that farmers and ranchers have faced in Kansas and around the country.
"Due to disrupted trade markets, weather disasters, and low commodity prices, net farm income is down by 50 percent since 2013."
"The work of ag lenders is very important for farmers and ranchers in rural communities to have access to credit, in good times and bad."
I would like to thank Jeff Shipp for giving me the opportunity to speak at their meeting.
"Reacting to the CBOs Budget & Economic Outlook Report This week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030 Report  ."
"The report details projections on the rising levels of federal deficits, debts and spending in the decade to come."
The CBOs projections make clear the unsustainable fiscal path that the country finds itself on.
"Their analysis highlights the rapid expansion of mandatory spending programs in our government, projecting that these programs will account for 65 percent of total government spending by the end of the decade."
"With the growth of mandatory spending programs outpacing the growth of revenue, Congress has the responsibility to produce a plan that ensures future generations do not bear the burdens of harmful spending."
"As a member of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, & Science, I will work to ensure that the spending bills are fiscally responsible and do not threaten the economic growth and opportunity of our children and grandchildren."

                    THE HAGEDORN REPORT:January Recap It was a busy January in Minnesota and DC.
"Congressman Hagedorn is pleased to report that hardworking southern Minnesotans have benefited from a number of achievements in January, including final passage of the USMCA and Phase One of the U.S.-China Trade Agreement being signed by the president."
"These trade wins mean protecting our jobs and better market access for our agriculture, manufacturing and medical products."
"The 2019 final jobs report reflects this sentiment as well, showing near record low unemployment and rising wages in Minnesota."
"Jims small contractors legislation also passed the House in January, making our small businesses more competitive when bidding for prime contracts."
"Additionally, Hagedorn has now completed 16 of the 21 stops on his district-wide Town Hall Tour, which is set to be complete in February."
"Rep. Hagedorn started off the month of February by focusing efforts on expanding working families access to affordable, quality childcare services by signing on as an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Small Business Child Care Investment Act."
This legislation works to expand access to childcare by granting non-profit childcare providers access to the same types ofSmall Business Administration (SBA) loans available to for-profit companies.

"                           Dear Lindsey,  Over the years, Ive helped people as a consumer protection attorney, supported public schools as a volunteer, raised two wonderful children, served as a state legislator, and Im now honored to represent beautiful NW Oregon in the US House of Representatives."
"Eight years ago, when I took my first oath of office in Congress, I swore to support and defend the US Constitution."
I thought of that oath often as the House considered whether to impeach President Trump.
Ivoted for impeachmentbecause of the overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power by asking a foreign country to meddle in our election and then trying to cover up his wrongdoing by obstructing the Houses investigation.
History will judge the Senates vote yesterday to acquit President Trump.
"As the House continues our work on behalf of the American people, we will build on thehundreds of bipartisan billswe have already passedandcontinue touphold our Constitutional dutyto bea vigorouscheck on the Trump administration."
Join Me at a Town Hall Meeting in April Every year I hold town hall meetings around NW Oregon so I can hear firsthand from the people Im honored to represent.
My spring series of town hall meetings will include six events in April.
There will be additional details foreach event on my websitesoon.
All weekday events will be in the evening.
"Vernonia Monday, April 6   Tigard  Tuesday, April 7   Portland  Saturday, April 11   Warrenton  Monday, April 13   McMinnville  Tuesday, April 14   Hillsboro  Thursday, April 16       We All Need Health Care Access tohealth care is a human right, but far too often people in our community face communication, cultural, and financial barriers that prevent them from accessing care."
"Thats why I brought Serena Cruz, the Executive Director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation and an advocate for health care accessibility and immigrant rights,asmy guest at the State of the Union address."
Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Centerprovidescriticalhealth careservicesand is named for a six-year-old daughter of migrant farm workers who died after a cut in her foot became infected.
"If she had been able to access health care, Virginia would have turned 51 years oldlast month."
"Today, Serena reports that the clinic is seeing pregnant women who are too afraid to seek the prenatal care they need because of the frequent attacks byPresidentTrumpandhis administration onimmigrantsandpeople of color."
We must stand up for all members of our community.
"In Congress, I am committed to stopping hateful policies and fighting for increased access to health care for all."
"Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt Addressing the high cost of higher education is one of my priorities, and one of the reasons I entered public service."
"Students today face a very different reality than I did: I was able to work my way through community college, a bachelors degree, and a law degree with a manageable amount of debt."
"When I sent out a survey about student loans last fall, more than 700 people responded."
"They described their student debt as being stressful, burdensome, painful, and overwhelming."
"To help these borrowers and others like them, I recentlyheld a clinic on student loan debtwith a national expert."
"There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to address crushing student debt, like making it easier for borrowers to access and stay inaffordablerepayment plans."
The House Education  Labor Committee included that provision and several others I drafted in the College Affordability Act.
I hope the House will vote on this legislation soon to provide needed relief to students and borrowers.
"At Home and at the Border, Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies Cause Harm I recently visited the Southern Borderto investigate the Trump Administrations Remain in Mexico policy, which hasstranded tens of thousands of asylum-seekersin dirty and dangerous tent camps."
"In Matamoros, Mexico, Isaw families and many children living in squalor, without running water or adequate food.This isno way to treat familieswho are coming to the United States to escape violenceor persecution and who have the right to request asylum under international law."
"When I returned home I met with nine asylum-seekers, including an unaccompanied child, who are participating in the legal asylum process."
"They told me about the dangers they fled and the hardship they have experienced here, all in the hope of making their case for asylum and building a better life in the United States of America."
Too often this administration has attacked immigrants and fueled racism and xenophobia.
"In a roundtable discussion witha dozen local advocates, I heard about how fear and anxiety is clouding the lives of our immigrant neighbors, includingDreamers who have known no other homeand now risk being deported."
"Istand with our immigrant neighborsand our friends, who are an integral part of our communities andmustbe treated with dignity."
"In Case You Missed It  I helped improve themajor new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canadain the areas of labor, environment, access to medicines, and enforcement."
"After a protracted battle with the Administration, we secured anagreement that is better for Oregonians, workers, and the environment."
"My bipartisanBlue Carbon for the Planet Actwill harness the powerful ability ofhealthy wetlands, tidal marshes, and seagrassestosequestercarbon for centuries or even millennia and mitigate the climate crisis."
"The House passed thebipartisanProtecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,whichI co-led, toprotect thecivil rights of older workersin the workplace."
I alsohelped advancelegislation tomake sure thatpregnant workershave the accommodations they needtowork and stay healthyduring pregnancy.
Federal funding will support thePortland Art Museums new Rothko Pavilionand the renovation of theAstoria Library.
"News from Representative Haaland                           About Contact Services        February 5, 2020  Dear Lindsey,  Every person in this country deserves a fair shot at success, but President Trump is failing hard-working American families."
"Last night, President Trump gave a misleading picture."
The reality is that Trumps policies are immoral and they hurt women and children in our communities while enriching himself and his friends.
"As I escorted President Trump to the House Chamber, I was representing our For the People Agenda, a bold contrast to President Trump, reminding everyone that this country is for them  no matter where they come from, what their background, or who they love."
"As President Trump expands his Muslim ban and his officials announce that they will target DREAMers, I am proud that my colleagues and I passed the American Dream and Promise Act and I will fight for us to pass the No BAN Act to put an end to this and future discriminatory travel bans."
"As a Vice Chair of the Equality Caucus, I am advocating against the attacks on our LGBTQ community and am using my new position on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold this Administration accountable."
"President Trump touts a growing economy, but his policies are failing hard-working American families while enriching himself and his friends.And under Attorney General Barr, the Department of Justice is fighting in court to repeal the ACA, taking away healthcare from thousands of New Mexicans.President Trump has even announced he plans to cut Social Security and Medicare."
"Families in New Mexico and across the country know that this Administration's policies are working for the wealthy and well-connected, while hurting hardworking families."
"Almost 50,000 New Mexicans in our district rely on SNAP to feed their families, but are now threatened by rule changes that will take food away from hundreds of thousands of people across the country."
"As someone who had to rely on SNAP at times to keep food on the table, I know how important these programs are to our community."
"I will work with my colleagues to fight on behalf of every day New Mexicans, not just the wealthy."
"While President Trump claims to make us safer, he has disarmed us in our fight against climate change, which remains our greatest national security threat."
"I am proud to have voted for and passed the Climate Action Now Act, a bill aligning us the Paris Climate Accords and restoring our position leading the world in this fight."
The House of Representatives also passed the Scientific Integrity Act to ensure all decisions made by the federal government follow sound science instead of the whims of lobbyists.
"As the Vice Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, I will continue to hold up New Mexicos commitment to a renewable energy revolution as an example for the rest of the country."
"The President tried to claim credit for improving our national security, but instead he nearly dragged us into an unnecessary war and stole money from vital projects for his misguided border wall."
"New Mexicans have a proud history of heeding the call to service and deserve leadership that works for them, not uses them as props."
"As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was able to get housing protections for our military families, which will help all of our serving families living on Kirtland Air Force Base, as well as provisions to start the PFAS cleanup on Kirtland."
"Lastly, my membership on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the U.S. puts me in a position to hold the federal government to its trust responsibility to provide for healthcare, public safety, housing, and infrastructure programs."
"As part of this effort, I will continue to be a tireless advocate for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women so we can give a voice to this silent crisis and enact concrete solutions to address it."
"We do have things to be proud of over this past year, there have been victories and improvements for every day Americans due to the House of Representatives."
"                                       This Week in Washington Today, the House impeachment managers and the Presidents defense team will make their closing arguments in the Senates impeachment trial ahead of an expected final vote on Wednesday."
I was extremely disappointed on Friday when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and my Republican colleagues blocked the Senate and the American people from seeing documents and hearing from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the Presidents actions.
This is far from a full and fair trial - and a sad abdication of the Senate's Constitutional duties.
"In the coming days, I will address my colleagues and the American people from the Senate floor on the topic of the Presidents impeachment."
Stay tuned to my Twitter and Facebook pages for more details on the exact timing.
"Also this week, the President will deliver his State of the Union address tomorrow, and Laconia Police Officer Eric Adams will be my guest of honor."
"Officer Adams has gained national recognition for his work as Laconias Prevention, Enforcement, and Treatment Coordinator."
"In this role  the first of its kind in New England  Officer Adams has helped revolutionize the way that law enforcement across the country approach drug addiction and recovery, prioritizing meeting people where they are to help them get the treatment and support that they need to overcome substance use disorder."
"Officer Adams has set an example for our state and our country in bringing an innovative approach to tackling the substance misuse epidemic, helping put countless Granite Staters on the path to recovery."
"As the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic continues to rage in our communities, I am incredibly grateful for people like Officer Adams who are stepping up to help stem the tide of this crisis."
"I will continue fighting to combat the devastating opioid epidemic by supporting the life-saving efforts of law enforcement, health care providers, and community leaders working on prevention, treatment, and recovery."
"With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan What the Senator is Working On President Trump signed bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Senator Hassan, to codify in law that grant funding to increase security resources for houses of worship and nonprofit organizations must be available for small states like New Hampshire, not just major metropolitan areas."
"Senator Hassan spoke out against the Trump Administrations announcement of new guidance that would allow states to implement Medicaid block grantswhich could dramatically reduce the amount of Medicaid fundingstating that the policy will directly harm children and families, individuals who experience disabilities, seniors, and Americans across the country who depend on Medicaid for their health care coverage."
Senator Hassan wrote an op-ed highlighting the role of craft breweries in New Hampshires economy and her successful efforts to extend tax cuts for the craft beverage industry in the recent bipartisan government funding agreement.
"Photo of the Week As Senator Hassan discussed above, her guest to this years State of the Union Address is Officer Eric Adams of Laconia."
"Officer Adams innovative role as the Prevention, Enforcement, and Treatment Coordinator at the Laconia Police Department is helping law enforcement across the country reshape their approach to tackling the substance misuse epidemic."

"                    Norton, Bowser, Mendelson and Oversight Committee Chairwoman Maloney Announce Date for Historic Committee Vote on Nortons D.C. Statehood Bill    Congresswoman Norton, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, and House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) announced at a press conference on January 30th that Nortons bill to make D.C. the 51st state, the Washington, D.C."
"51), will be voted on in the Committee at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, February 11."
This vote will be the first congressional vote on the D.C. statehood bill since Norton got the first-ever House floor vote in 1993.
"Once passed by the Committee, H.R."
51 will be ready for a vote on the House floor.
Passing bills on the House floor requires 218 votes.
Nortons bill has 224 cosponsors.
"Norton says she is particularly grateful to Chairwoman Maloney for her support, particularly in granting Nortons request that the Committee vote occur on February 11, the week of the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass."
Lincoln freed D.C.'s slaves before issuing the Emancipation Proclamation for all other slaves in the United States.
Frederick Douglass was a longtime D.C. resident who fought tirelessly for full and equal rights for D.C. residents.
Read Nortons full remarks here.
Norton Joins Oversight Subcommittee on Environment    Congresswoman Norton announced that she has joined the House Committee on Oversight and Reforms Subcommittee on the Environment.
"Norton, the second most-senior Democrat on the Committee, now sits on three Oversight subcommittees: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Government Operations, and Environment."
"In Nortons new role, she will help focus the Subcommittee on numerous public health and environmental concerns, including climate change, environmental protection, public lands, endangered species, air and water quality, conservation, energy policy, research and development, and the regulatory affairs of these issues."
"Combatting climate change has long been one of my top priorities in Congress, Norton said."
I hope to bring my experience as the former head of a federal agency to hold this administration accountable for their failure to protect public health and the environment for future generations.
"Norton Introduces Bill to Establish National Effort to Promote Healthy Lifestyles through Nutrition and Exercise    Congresswoman Norton introduced the Promoting Healthier Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise (LIFE) Act of 2020, which would encourage exercise and healthy eating habits nationwide."
"Nortons bill would provide $25 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to combat obesity and sedentary lifestyles in three ways: conducting national education campaigns about how to recognize and address overweight and obesity; training health professionals to recognize the signs of obesity early and to educate people concerning healthy lifestyles; and developing intervention strategies to be used in everyday life, such as in the workplace and in community settings."
This initial funding would be only for pilot efforts to develop best practices and give the country a coherent national strategy for combating overweight and obesity.
Reducing overweight and obesity rates has been a priority for Norton in Congress.
"Although her LIFE Act is a national bill, she notes that the District of Columbia has higher rates than many jurisdictions of conditions related to obesity, such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease."
"Adult obesity rates in the United States have more than doubled since 1980, from 15 percent to 35 percent."
Read Nortons full statement here.
Norton Hosts Quarterly Meeting with National Park Service    Congresswoman Norton held a community meeting with the National Park Service (NPS) and D.C. residents at the Cleveland Park Library on January 30th.
Nortons quarterly meetings are an ongoing series for District of Columbia residents and NPS.
"Nortonannounced last Maythat she had gotten NPS to commit to regular public meetings with D.C. residents to hear directly from the community regarding NPS parks, which constitute almost all of the Districts parks, in their neighborhoods."
"NPS is one of my priorities because almost all parkland in the District of Columbia is owned by NPS and funded by the federal government, Norton said."
"Our regular meetings throughout the city have been popular with D.C. residents in ensuring NPS carries out its important local responsibilities, including frequent communication with residents and transparency with them on conditions in our local parks."
"We are pleased that our parks and their upkeep are funded by their owner, NPS."
"Although NPS is not a local agency, when it comes to our neighborhood parks, that is exactly how they must perform."
I am grateful that NPS has agreed to hear from the community on a regular basis to prioritize their needs and concerns.

I hope you enjoyed the big game yesterday.
"It was an exciting game (and, as a Seahawks fan, I was happy to see the Niners lose)."
The Groundhog Day commercial... and the food!
"I ate far too many chips, far too much dip, and way too many chicken wings."
"Actually, it was a pretty fun game (and my daughters have convinced me to become a fan of The Masked Singer)."
"Tomorrow, Ill be heading back to DC, and the first order of business is the State of the Union address."
I was asked by someone after my town hall this Saturday what I hoped to hear from President Trump on Tuesday night.
There are a lot of differences between the residents priorities and mine.
"Having said that, most of the folks I represent want the President to work with Democrats and Republicans to solve some problems."
"In his address, I hope the President outlines some areas where he believes he can work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people."
"In fact, this morning, I joined a number of my colleagues in asking that President Trump address areas where the American people want folks in D.C. to find common ground and make progress, including:   Improving access to quality, affordable health care."
"Unfortunately, the Administration has taken steps that have increased premiums and increased the number of uninsured Americans."
There are opportunities to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and fix elements of our healthcare system that need fixing.
That should be a priority that both parties can get behind.
Following through on a commitment to rebuild Americas crumbling infrastructure.
Its hard for America to compete in a 21st Century economy with 19th Century infrastructure.
"There arent Democratic roads or Republican bridges, so this ought to be an area where the two parties and collaborate."
Prioritizing a future that works for all Americans.
"In the midst of disruptive economic change, its important to ensure that American workers are empowered to navigate those changes rather than be victimized by them."
"Investments in education and training, efforts to increase wages, and strengthening protections for workers can ensure that more people in more places have economic opportunity."
Restoring Americas role in the world.
Its time to reengage constructively with our allies and restore our role as a leader.
That can improve Americas security and economy.
Taking action to build long-lasting solutions to reduce carbon emissions.
The clean energy sector will be a core driver of economic growth and job creation.
"There are a number of common-sense, bipartisan proposals that would represent concrete action to curb carb emissions, spur economic growth and create jobs."
"I feel so strongly about the need to make progress on that last priority, Im bringing a special guest to the State of the Union: Kitsap County resident Mike Kelly."
"Mike, a small businessowner who lives with his family on Bainbridge Island, is the Congressional District Liaison in our region for Citizens Climate Lobby, a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on policies to combat climate change."
Ive been working actively to see the United States take action to step up to the climate crisis.
"Thankfully, Im not alone."
"In fact, folks across our region and across the country are stepping up to raise awareness about the need to act."
"Mike Kelly, local organizers, and the team at Citizens Climate Lobby are helping to lead the way."
Im proud to have Mike attend the State of the Union to continue the call for the President to listen to the American people who are not just demanding action - but leadership - to combat climate change and its impacts.
"We know that if we do this right, we can not only help our planet - we can create quality jobs and sustainable economic growth."
You can read all about what Mikes attendance means to him in the Kitsap Sun.
"There are plenty of policy differences between me and this Administration, but in an era of divided government, progress requires collaboration."
"I hope we hear that commitment to working together from him tomorrow, too."
"Now, on to the news Taking Action to Keep America Safe  In recent weeks, theres been a lot of discussion about rising tensions between the United States and Iran."
"As Ive traveled across our region, Ive heard from folks who are deeply concerned about this escalation - and I share those concerns."
"Ultimately, the American people do not want - and Congress has not authorized - another war in the Middle East."
"Our servicemembers and diplomats who serve there, including the ones I visited in Iraq this past November, deserve a strategy that keeps them safe, enhances our security, and fosters long term stability in the region."
"Last week, Congress passed two bills I co-sponsored to reclaim the Constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and authorize the use of military force, an authority that has eroded over the last two decades."
"You can hear more about that here:    Ensuring Future Generations Never Forget  Every year on Holocaust Memorial Day, we honor the millions of innocent people who lost their lives."
Families across the world have their own stories of this dark chapter in our worlds history.
"This year on Holocaust Memorial Day, which coincided this year with the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the House passed the Never Again Education Act - bipartisan legislation I supported to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America so future generations can continue to learn these stories."
"This bill will provide fundamental resources, education, and training for teachers and students across the country to ensure we continue to educate our communities and future generations on the lessons of the Holocaust - and ultimately promote the importance of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people."
"Continuing the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic  Across our country, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have been one of the leading causes of drug overdoses and fatalities."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 41% of the 70,200 drug overdoses in the United States in 2017 were caused by fentanyl and illicit chemical copycats of the drug, which is 100 times more potent than morphine."
"And in 2018, there were over 30,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths alone."
"In response, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2018 placed a temporary emergency order to classify all fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 drugs (meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use)."
"This temporary order increased restrictions in terms of access, manufacturing, and use - and has led to the supply of new fentanyl analogues dropping by 75 percent."
"Last week, the House took bipartisan action to extend the temporary order on these drugs for 15 more months, overwhelmingly passing the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act."
The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report within 12 months on the public health and safety effects of controlling fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1.
"While its only a temporary solution, its a start."
"Im hopeful that Congress will continue to work to develop common-sense, long-term solutions to the opioid crisis."
Working for You  Honoring Our Veterans  Want to be inspired?!?
Listen to this story...
I recently held a Vietnam Veterans pinning ceremony in Tacoma to say thank you to Vietnam-era vets on behalf of a grateful nation.
"About halfway through the event, we got a call that a group of veterans was on its way from the Retsil Veterans Home in Kitsap County but that they would be an hour late."
"Having already pinned everyone in attendance, I made an announcement that more vets were on the way, and I asked if folks would be willing to stick around to thank the folks who were coming from Retsil."
I was so moved that every single person stuck around.
"One veteran said to me, You know, a lot of us have waited forty or fifty years to get thanked."
I can wait a few minutes to honor these folks coming from Retsil.
It was a real testament to the awesome character of our community - and of the veterans who have served our country.
Im grateful for everyone that came out for this special event.
"Celebrating Team Kitsap  The economic forecast for Kitsap County is bright thanks to the presence of the incredible employers, innovative educational partners, and the economic development A-Team that is the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance."
It was great to join them to talk about opportunities for the future.
Count me as a proud member of Team Kitsap!
Supporting Washingtons Ocean Economy  Im committed to supporting Washingtons ocean economy.
I enjoyed the opportunity to be in Grays Harbor to hear from members of the fishing community and discuss a new bill I introduced to improve the federal fishery disaster process and ensure more timely disaster relief for impacted communities.
Im also working as a member of the Appropriations Committee to restore our salmon populations.
Helping Our Seniors  Seniors today are facing unique challenges.
"Thats why I was grateful for the opportunity to hold a seniors town hall at the Willows Retirement Living in Bremerton to hear from folks and to talk about the work Im doing to ensure Congress protects Medicare  Social Security, lowers the cost of prescription drug prices, and keeps our nations promise to take care of older Americans."
Hearing from You at Town Halls  Speaking of town halls...
"I held a town hall in Suquamish on Saturday where we talked about opportunities to reduce student debt and ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care."
Join me February 10th at 5:30pm PT for a Facebook Live Town Hall.
"Its always important for me to be available, accessible, and accountable to you."
OK - thats it for now folks.
THE CORONAVIRUS I met with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases this week about the coronavirus.
"Rep. Carter and members of the Energy and Commerce Committee meeting with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases about the coronavirus The agencies informed us that, at this time, the immediate risk to the American people from the coronavirus is low."
"While the risk is low, this is a rapidly changing situation and the CDC recommends taking some precautions including getting a flu shot and taking everyday preventative actions to stop the spread of germs."
"To find more information about the CDC's recommendations, visit the CDC's website by clicking here."
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS A BIG WIN FOR AMERICAN WORKERS President Trump signed the USMCA this week.
I was proud to support the trade agreement when it was before the U.S. House of Representatives.
"The USMCA is a big win for American workers, farmers and families."
"The agreement is expected to create 176,000 new jobs, spur $68 billion in economic growth, create a new chapter on digital trade and expand agricultural markets."
Click here for the latest episode of Buddy's Briefing I discussed this historic trade agreement in this edition of Buddy's Briefing.

FIGHTING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.
It is a schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act.
"However, drug traffickers have been able to make small changes to fentanyls chemical structure, creating new variations of the substance called analogues."
"Because of how quickly the traffickers are able to modify the substance, most of these analogues are not on the schedule of controlled drugs and are therefore outside of the control of law enforcement."
The creation of analogues has outpaced DEAs ability to schedule them.
"Fortunately, the Controlled Substances Act provides the Attorney General with the authority to temporarily place a substance in schedule I of the CSA for two years if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety."
"In 2018, the DEA used this authority to place fentanyl analogues and fentanyl like substances in Schedule I."

"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                          February 2, 2020 Friday night, in a showing of true cowardice and abdication of duty, Republican Senators voted against subpoenaing key documents and witnesses in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump, effectively condoning the Presidents crimes andthe railroading of our Constitution."
"I believe, and the majority of America knows, thatthis President cant be legitimately acquitted because he never underwent a real trial."
"The sham trial began ominously when Senator Mitch McConnell, in the dead of night, pushedthrough a set of trial rules without guarantees for key witnesses or documents and despite the Trump Administrations blatant obstruction of Congress and the American people from hearing all the facts of the case."
"Nevertheless, the House managers presented a powerful case, proving to the American people that the President must be removed from office for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress."
"As the Presidents defense team presented its arguments, a shocking development heightened the urgent need for witness testimony and documents to be turned over to Congress that thisAdministration refusedto provide."
"Friday night's vote by Republican Senators not to call witnesses and provide the public with a complete and unvarnished accounting of the President's scheme to bribe Ukraine with millions of dollars of badly needed military funding and equipment -- fundsalready approved byCongress -- inexchange for dirt on his politicalrival makes them complicit inthe President'sscheme.Without witnesses or evidence this is not a trial, it's a travesty."
"Republicans in the House and Senatewho have willingly gonealong withthe President'sdefense that anything he does, no matter how criminal or corrupt, is unimpeachable if he says it's in the public's interest has placedour entire system of government, the rule of law, and our Constitution in great peril."
"This is a moment in history that revealedthose whohad the courage and conviction to uphold their duty, and those who cared more about advancing the power of their party and hanging onto their seats."
"Despite this historic low point, the Democratically controlled House continued with criticallegislative business to benefit hardworking Americans and their families.I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to make it easier for military survivors to report sexual assaults."
I also led a letter with 49 of my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women.
"Though the examples are numerous, the letter was promptedin light of his most recent comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing ""a good job"" on a reporter that Pompeoverbally attacked simplybecause she did her job."

"Legislative Highlights Impeachment Update: Bolton Bombshell Drops as Senate Heads Toward Critical Vote on Witnesses and Documents It was reported earlier this week that John Bolton, the Presidents former National Security Advisor, wrote in the manuscript for his book that the President told him directly that he was withholding security aid from Ukraine so that he could extract announcements of investigations into his Democratic political rivals."
"On Friday, The New York Times reported that Bolton's manuscript contains details of the President directing Bolton to help with the President's pressure campaignonUkraine, which dangled the promise of a White House meeting and critically neededfunding for the fledgling democracyin exchange for a hit jobon Trumps political rival."
"The article states,Mr."
"Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the presidents personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the presidents impeachment defense."
"That gun isnt just smoking, the barrel isred hot and the trigger is covered with the President's grubby fingerprints."
The Senate trial heads into its finalconclusionnext week followingSenate Republicans voteFriday night against calling fact witnesses or requiring a shred of documentary evidence to be presented.
Rest assured thatmy Democratic colleagues in the House and I will continue to fight the President's and Republicans' attempts to consolidate power in the Executive Branch and their cover-upof his crimesand corruption.
America needs and demands the truth; we will not rest until all the facts are unearthed for the public's view and benefit.
"Introduced Legislation to Make it Safe for Military Survivors to Report Assault On Thursday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague, Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE), to make it easier for sexual assault survivors across the military to report their assailants."
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) expect to introduce companion legislation in the United States soon.
Too many sexual assault survivors in our military and academies hesitate to report attacks because they fear they be punished for minor infractionssuch as underage drinking or curfew violationsthat may be uncovered during the assault investigation.
"Getting survivors to report these incidents so that they can access services and perpetrators can be held accountable is should be the focus of military leadership, not punishment of victims for minor misconduct."
"Our bill will ensure survivors cannot be punished for minor issues when they report an assault, unless aggravating circumstances exist."
The Air Force Academy has already tested this program and seen positive results.
"Survivors and their loved ones should know that will fight hard to pass this legislation in this years National Defense Authorization Act, and that they are not alone."
Sent Letter to the President Condemning his Continuing Degradation of Women a letter to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women.
"The letter was sent on the heels of Secretary Pompeo disparaging NPRs Mary Louise Kelly, a well-renowned journalist, for doing her job when she asked Pompeo about Ukraine."
"Kelly said that Pompeo shouted and swore at her and demanded she find the country on an unmarked map, which she did with no trouble."
Pompeo then barred the reporter from covering his upcoming trip to Europe.
"The next day, President Trump validated this misogynistic and autocratic behavior by stating, you did a good job on her."
"Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, an esteemed career diplomat committed to anti-corruption reforms who the President referred to as the woman who is going to go through some things in the infamous July 25 call with President Zelensky, was yet another casualty."
It is most shameful that the words young girls and boys hear directed at women from the upper echelons of power are dripping with disdain and disrespect.
"It is as if this President relishes the opportunity to publicly humiliate any woman who fights back, speaks up, or takes up space."
"As the women of the DWC admonished him in our letter, the President of the United States should set a moral example for our children, not be the biggest bully on the playground."
"Asked Defense Department About Remedial Action for Whistleblower Retaliation At a hearing this week of the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, we heard from a panel of government officials and experts on the need for stronger whistleblower protections in our laws."
"As Co-Chair of the Houses Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I have long advocated for whistleblower protection laws and have secured crucial legislative victories advancing rights to intelligence and congressional whistleblowers."
"Much of the hearing focused on the huge backlog of 2,500 cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has been unable to function for over a year because President Trump and Senator McConnell have failed to fill seats on the board for quorum."
"I asked Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, why there possibly could be cases of illegal reprisals against whistleblowers that are substantiated during inspector general investigations and yet never result in compensation for the whistleblower."
"Fine agreed with me that there is a disturbing trend of defense agencies essentially ignoring inspector general recommendations to make whistleblowers whole, and that Congress must continue to put pressure and legislate to protect whistleblowers."
"Armed Services Committee Hearing on Security of the Korean Peninsula On Tuesday, I pressed representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Intelligence Agency at the House Armed Services Committees hearing on the lack of a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea."
"The President gave Kim Jong-un multiple PR victories, praising him, meeting with him, and becoming the first U.S. President to set foot in North Korea, raising their global recognition and validating a regime never before recognized by Democratic or Republican Administrations."
None of these displays got us any closer to containing the North Korean threat.
"Now, the Administration claims its applying a maximum pressure campaign."
"However, its also pressuring and disrespecting our allies in South Korea and Japan, demanding outrageous increases to the billions of dollars our allies already contribute annually to our mutual defense."
The Presidents handling of the security region is erratic and dangerous.
We must continue to demand a coherent strategy for dealing with our adversaries and hold this Administrations feet to the fire for the safety and security of the region and our country.
"Oversight Committee Hearing on 75 Years After the Holocaust: The Ongoing Battle Against Hate Tuesday, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Additional hearings will be held in the coming weeks on voter suppression in minority communities, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim discrimination, anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions, and challenges facing LGBTQ individuals."
"As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel, Ill also preside at a hearing next month on the dangers of white supremacist elements in our military."
"Discussion on Poverty in the 21st Century and its Impact on Women As Co-Chair of the Democratic Womens Caucus, I participated in a discussion on modern day poverty and its disproportionate impact on women."
We heard from experts who explained the shocking reality that more people die of poverty in America than heart attacks and cancer combined.
"For millions of Americans, every day is a struggle to avoid eviction, put food on the table, or pay for just one doctors visit."
"Beyond these challenges, many women also take on the dual responsibilities of a traditional job and home and child care."
"This social production work constitutes a second job, but its not adequately valued in our society."
"In a particularly heart-breaking moment, I listened as one mother recounted her daughters struggle with cancer."
"Like many Americans struggling with inadequate health care, her daughter went to an emergency room after discovering a lump in her breast and was turned away without any additional care or tests due to her lack of health insurance."
"After months of no medical care, severe pains forced her back to the ER."
The untreated cancer had spread through her entire body and caused her breast to completely rot off.
"As the wealthiest country in the world, it is a choice  not a forced reality  to not invest in affordable health care for every American."
"Indeed, the mothers home state of Alabama opted out of the Medicaid expansion."
No mother should have to watch her daughter die before her eyes knowing it was avoidable.
"Doubling rates of homelessness, hospital closures to make way for real estate development, and a complete lack of affordable dental care rounded out the discussion and further underscored the inhumane inequality growing in our country."
We must remember that our nations successes cannot be fairly measured without considering everyone that has been left behind.
Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives from CalPERS  I am proud of all of Californias public employees and pleased that their retirement is in the hands of the trustworthy and forward-thinking managers at CalPERS.
Voices of Californias 14th District  Here are some issues they raised this week:  96 constituents expressed their concern for the climate crisis.
"We must take bold action to combat climate change, end our addiction to fossil fuels, and grow our green economy."
How we address climate change now will be the defining moment of this century.
You have my word that I will be a vigorous advocate for bold action to solve this crisis so that we can leave a healthier planet for future generations.
60 constituents shared their support for our public lands.
"For years, Republicans in Congress have waged a war against our public lands, introducing dangerous bills that threaten public land ownership and benefit special interest groups and corporate polluters at the expense of our environment."
"I have consistently voted against legislation that would allow state governments to sell or exploit public lands for profit and I have fought efforts to scale back protections under the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other critical environmental safeguards."
22 constituents expressed their support for increased consumer safety regulations.
"As an avid proponent of consumer protection, I recognize the importance of improved labeling and consumer education campaigns and have introduced legislation to combat risks ranging from lead-filled childrens glasses to poisonous detergent pods."
"                          NEWSROOM  18TH DISTRICT               January 31, 2020              Weekly Report From Your Congresswoman    This week the Senate continued the impeachment trial of President Trump based on the two Articles of Impeachment the House passed last month."
"The trial began with three days of the House Impeachment Managers making their case for removal, followed by three days of the Presidents attorneys defending him."
Senators then submitted written questions which the Chief Justice read aloud and the House Managers and the Presidents attorneys responded to.
"On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives continued advancing its agenda for the people by introducing and passing bills, holding hearings, and oversight of the Executive Branch."
"As I write this to you, we await the decision of the full Senate as to whether witnesses and documents will be allowed in the trial."
"Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week   CDC Briefing on Coronavirus I met with Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response; and Rear Admiral Denise Hinton with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."
"The coronavirus is a respiratory illness caused by a virus first identified in Wuhan, China."
"Most of the known cases and all deaths associated with the disease have been in China, with only seven confirmed cases in the U.S. to date."
"According to the CDC, the risk to the American public is low, unless someone has recently traveled to Wuhan and is experiencing respiratory symptoms."
"For the latest information about the coronavirus, visit the CDCs website."
"To prevent transmission of diseases, two simple but powerful acts of prevention are recommended."
"Wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly, and cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and everyone should get a flu shot."
"Questioned the CEO of PGE at House Energy and Commerce Hearing on Wildfires  The two most destructive fires in Californian history, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed over 18,000 buildings, were linked to PGEs equipment."
"On January 29th I grilled the CEO of PGE, Bill Johnson, about the utilitys widespread intentional blackouts at a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Environment  Climate Change on the impact of wildfires on the power sector and the environment."
You can watch my questions from the hearing HERE.
Addressing the scourge of wildfires in California continues to be a top priority for me.
"Last October, I introduced the Smoke Planning and Research Act to provide federal funding to help communities research, develop, and implement plans to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke."
Im also pushing hard to strengthen infrastructure to withstand wildfires.
"In July, 2019, I introduced the WIRED Act to allow states to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that will be resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters."
"Currently, states lack this authority and the consequences have been dire."
"Health Subcommittee Hearing on Food and Drug Safety  As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine ten mostly bipartisan bills to improve the safety and transparency in our food and drugs."
Twenty cents out of every dollar spent by American consumers goes toward food or medicine regulated by the FDA.
We examined the FDAs immense mission with two panels of expert witnesses.
Our first panel considered four bills to grant the FDA new authorities to tackle challenges that threaten our drug supply.
"Taken together, these bills improve the drug supply chain from the very beginning to the very end so that patients have access to quality products that are genuine, affordable, and accurately labeled."
The second panel considered six bills that affect the FDAs oversight of food products.
Many of these bills act on decisions that the FDA has long delayed.
"For example, we heard about one bill, the FASTER Act, which would require food manufacturers to list sesame as an allergen on their products."
It would also fund into federal studies to better understand the growing prevalence of food allergies in the United States.
"To watch my opening statement, click HERE."
"Voted YES on the No War Against Iran Act  President Trumps assassination of General Soleimani has placed U.S. service members, diplomats, embassies, and allied interests around the world at high risk, and has brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war."
"To add insult to injury, the President failed to properly consult Congress or seek the legal authority to take military action against Iran."
"The Administration has also failed to fully explain what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the U.S. that required the strike."
"No Member of Congress carries a brief for General Soleimani or the Iranian government, but no President has the unilateral authority to take our nation to war without authorization from Congress."
The No War Against Iran Act underscores that Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Iran.
It also prohibits federal funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.
"Ive long had concerns about the Trump Administrations provocative behavior toward Iran, beginning with the President tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, and its why I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act last April."
My bill restricts this Administration and any future administrations from using any funds appropriated by Congress to take military action in and against Iran without authorization from Congress.
House Infrastructure Package  This week the Majority released our framework for a five-year $760 billion infrastructure bill.
"The framework addresses our nations crumbling infrastructure by investing in zero-emission vehicles, expands access to broadband, upgrades clean water infrastructure, and creates an estimated 10 million new jobs."
"The package also authorizes $12 billion to modernize our countrys 9-1-1 systems, based on my legislation the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act."
You can read more about the infrastructure plan HERE.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Workforce Mobility Act  I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help workers by prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements."
This occurs when an employer restricts an employees future prospects through their employment contracts.
"While California has long prohibited non-competes, 40 percent of Americans have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point in their career."
"Reps. Scott Peters, Mike Gallagher, and I introduced the Workforce Mobility Act to ban non-compete agreements with a few narrow exceptions (such as the sale of a business)."
"Much of Silicon Valley was built by former employees of one tech company leaving to found another, all allowed because of Californias ban on non-compete agreements."
This ban continues to allow the Valley to prosper as an innovation powerhouse.
"Im proud that my legislation will make this a nationwide policy, ensuring all Americans have the ability to innovate."
"The Protecting Community Television Act  Community television is a critical part of our society, giving a voice to nonprofits, artists, schools, local governments, and other community members who otherwise struggle to be heard."
I introduced legislation to ensure that community television operations continue to receive the resources they need to educate and inform viewers in the cities and towns where they operate.
"Today, local governments are permitted to require that cable companies meet community needs by providing in-kind contributions that benefit public, educational, and government (PEG) channels, also known as community television stations."
Unfortunately the FCC proposed regulatory changes that would effectively end the in-kind contributions that support PEG stations.
Senator Ed Markey and I introduced the Protecting Community Television Act to block the FCCs proposal and bolster community TV.
"Weekly Highlights  Meeting with the Foreign Minister of Laos  This week I had the honor of welcoming the Foreign Minister of Laos, His Excellency Saleumxay Kommasith, and the Laotian Ambassador to the U.S., His Excellency Khamphan Anlavan, to my Washington, D.C. office."
"My work to fund the removal of unexploded ordinances, such as landmines in Laos from the Vietnam War era has received bipartisan support in Congress and will save the lives of so many who remain vulnerable to these landmines."
Ive championed this issue by co-leading the Legacies of War Recognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act.
"In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies."
"Over 6,446 constituents have already contacted me in 2020."
I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me.
"This week, 1,289 constituents contacted our office about issues including:   137 constituents wrote to me about H.Con.Res."
"52 which expresses the sense of Congress that there is an ongoing climate emergency  87 constituents wrote to me about the Helping MOMS Act to help expand access to Medicaid coverage for expectant and new mothers  46 constituents wrote to me about the Childrens Product Warning Label Act to strengthen cosmetic product safety  Annas Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from."

We're working toward all these things and more to achieve true economic freedom.
But economic freedom also includes not worrying about losing your job if life happens.
Paid family leave should be available to every family of every formperiod.
"This week, the Ways and Means Committee had a hearing to learn the best way to make that a reality."
"Ways and Means Democrats advocated for why our proposal was far wider reaching than the Republican plan, and we're fighting for any progress we can make."
"However, I think we should bring the Oregon model, nationwide."
"Last year, our state passed, with bipartisan support, what I think most people will say is the most progressive paid leave policy in the country."
"It provides 12 weeks of paid leave, but unlike other paid leave laws, it ensures nearly all workers have access."
"Individuals can take up to 12 weeks paid including new parents, victims of domestic violence, and people who need to care for an ill family member, and to qualify, you need just $1,000 a year in wages."
That means low-income and part time workers can access the benefits.
"Its the first law to pay low-income workers a 100% of their wages when theyre off, with the cap on the weekly benefits of over $1,200 dollars a month."
"It provides employment protections for those who need them, and its paid for by a payroll tax from the workers and the employees, so everybody pays."
Its provides a level playing field.
We will all be called upon in our lives to care for ourselves or our loved ones.
This heavy responsibility is a fact of life and should not be compounded by the stress of balancing a job and putting food on the family table.
"Currently, millions of people are without paid family and medical leave."
They're being left behind.

"See my release and the exchange with the diplomat here.Announcing $1.3 Million Ryan White HIV Grant to Shelby County On Thursday, I announced that Shelby County will be receiving a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant of $1.3 million to support AIDS- and HIV-affected Memphians."

Sign Up for Congress on Your Corner and this e-Newsletter    I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies.
"If you are interested in attending one of my Congress on Your Corner events, you can sign up here to receive a notification as soon as the next event is scheduled."
"For those who havent participated in a telephone town hall, its easy to sign up for them by using this form."
"If you would like to receive this weekly e-Newsletter, or share it with others, you can do that with this form.Weekly Health Tip   Dont touch that three-bean salad."
"Seriously, with Sundays Super Bowl 54, a lot of us will be eating potluck at other peoples houses and eating foods we did not prepare ourselves."
We may also be inclined to imbibe more than usual.
"See the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) guidance on how to be prepared for game day here.Quotes of the Weeks    My primary thesis is still, what did the President know, and when did he know it?"
"-- Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, questioning former White House Counsel John Dean during the Nixon-Watergate hearings, June 29, 1973."
Thats what we celebrate today.
The long arc of progress.
"Progress that is never assured, never guaranteed, but always possible, always there to be earned  no matter how stuck we might seem sometimes."
No matter how divided or despairing we may appear.
No matter what ugliness may bubble up.
"Progress, so long as were willing to push for it; so long as were willing to reach for each other."
"          A message from Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, its easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: You dont make progress by standing on the sidelines."
"After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, were not surrendering."
"In fact, just the opposite: Were fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect."
Its an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives.
"Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community."
"I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities."
"Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you."
"Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke         Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents."
Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve.
"Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market."
These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here.
"Thats why Ive introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act."
"The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home."
"In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
"The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments."
The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers.
Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.
Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings.
I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act.
"This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex."
My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes.
New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.
"In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the Presidents anti-immigrant agenda."
"My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R."
6) passed in the House of Representatives last year.
"6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers."
"As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America."
"Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge."
"Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the Presidents xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants."
"As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, Im committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census."
It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community.
We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive.
Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts.
"Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States."
I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.
I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power.
"In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people."
"As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests."
"Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities."
"Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy  Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts."
I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R.
"4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure."
My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R.
4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee.
This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on Americas national security.
"This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residentsmany in the Ninth Districtwere left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared."
I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesnt happen again.
Brooklyns communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century.
"To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn."
"With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities."
"As a firm believer in Congress ability to come together and combat this nations contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation."
I am proud that my bill H.R.
"5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn."
My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy.
Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007.
"At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing."
Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all.
"In Major Owens honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives."
My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R.
"8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R."
"1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act."
Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell.
This inaction is unacceptable.
The fact is: background checks save lives.
Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns.
Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.
"I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R."
"1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons."
The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm.
"From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence."
"Im proud that my bill, the Ending One-Ring Scams Act, passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls."
"If youve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers."
"These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills."
I know robocalls are more than annoyingtheyre costly.
"My legislation, the Ending One-Ring Scams Act."
will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.
"Like many residents of Central Brooklyn, I believe confronting challenges is made easier when you have a kind and resilient community beside you."
"Whether partnering with the Postmaster General to ensure the productivity of the mail service, hosting a Health Fair to discuss the importance of access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, or addressing housing costs, my strength and courage derives from constituents."
"Senator for Oregon  Dear *First Name*, The Trump administration is pushing a proposal that would threaten earned Social Security benefits for thousands of Americans struggling with a disability.I?m sounding the alarm: the knives are out for your earned benefits."
"While Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress?pursue another set of tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, they?re simultaneously scheming to hassle and harass people with disabilities in order to pay $2.6 billion less from Social Security.?"
"Here?s the bottom line: Social Security is an earned benefit, which means everyone who is eligible has already paid into the program with each paycheck they earn."
This proposal will force Americans with disabilities to undergo a ?continuing disability review?
with greater frequency.
"This means more bureaucratic red tape, denying Americans with disabilities these critical resources, and putting vulnerable Americans at greater risk of falling through the cracks with excessive paperwork."
Americans will suffer if this proposal is allowed to move forward.
Families won?t be able to make rent or put food on the table due to this change.
"Corporations and the mega-rich who will continue to reap the benefits from Trump?s tax giveaways, the same giveaways that Republicans use as an excuse to make unnecessary cuts to America?s vital earned benefits programs.?"
"You can speak out against this unnecessary and cruel proposal, but the deadline for public comment is just around the corner."
"You can submit comments to the Social Security Administrationhere  until Friday, Jan. 31.?"
"Meanwhile, I?ll continue to press  the Trump administration to withdraw this unnecessary and misguided proposal.??????"
"Sincerely,    Please do not reply to this e-mail."
"Dear Friend, Back in Washington after a busy week home in Tampa!"
"I enjoyed seeing friends and neighbors as we honored the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the 40th annual Tampa Organization of Black Affairs breakfast, parade and uplifting interfaith service at Allen Temple A.M.E."
"This week I continue to feel inspired by Dr. Kings words: Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."
"Across the Capitol, the Impeachment trial of President Trump on his Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress continues."
Thank you for contacting Floridas U.S.
Senators to urge them to conduct a fair trial with witnesses and documents so that all information is made plain to the American people.
Tune in today and tomorrow for question from senators.
"Committee Action (SCCC Logo): I called on Google this week to take steps to stop the spread of dangerous climate denial and climate misinformation videos on YouTube, the most used social platform in the United States as it has done with other dangerous misinformation."
"Google should take steps to address this harmful misinformation, including ending free advertising of videos promoting harmful falsehoods about the causes and effects of the climate crisis."
(E To repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002: This bill includes amendments that would repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)  the Iraq Resolution of 2002 - and prohibit funding for military action against Iran that is not authorized by Congress.
"Since my first congressional campaign in 2006, I have supported a withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq and redeployment of U.S. troops from Afghanistan."
"Although the Constitution vests Congress with the sole power to declare war, President Trump like other presidents before him has taken military action without consulting Congress."
"I will vote in support of repealing the 2002 Iraq AUMF so that it cannot be used to justify new and unrelated, offensive military actions."
"943 - Never Again Education Act: On Monday, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the House adopted an important inititiave to combat antisemitism by passing bipartisan legislation to schools with tools to teach about the Holocaust."
I'm proud to cosponsor this bill.
We have a moral obligation to teach about the horrors of the past so they are never repeated.
Thank you to the many neighbors and community leaders I saw last week on collaborations to lift our Tampa area neighbors.
AARP joined me in highlighting the importance of the House of Representatives passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act to level the playing field for older workers and restoring their rights to fight back against age discrimination.
Members of my Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force also joined me to discuss what Tampa nonprofit and community leaders are doing to assist families on the island and those who have relocated to the Tampa Bay area due to Hurricane Maria and recent earthquakes that continue to shake the island.
" News from Representative Waltz        January 28, 2020                             Dear Ms. Cormack, Thank you for reading my newsletter!My team and I continue to work for you and our community."
It was a very eventful district work week back in Florida and I'm excited to tell you about what we accomplished.
THIS WEEK IN THE DISTRICT:I love district work weeks because they allow me to meet so many inspiring and amazing individuals in our community.

"Police Officer Charles Hogue, in particular, went above and beyond to save lives even as he himself was shot."
He was a hero that day and every day.
"Our first responders, EMTs, police officers and our firefighters stationed at military bases across the country are the protectors of our protectors."
"Unfortunately, they dont have access to the supplies they need to serve our military."
This is why Im introducing a bill to give first responders access to the supplies they need.
"I named this bill in honor of my mom, Brenda, who has selflessly supported me, our military, our community and our country."
Hoping we can get this bill passed to better help our first responders.
"                                                        Dear Friends, This week, I spent my time meeting with folks across West Tennessee.Here's a close look at a few of the highlights from my week back home:    Roberta and I enjoyed welcomingVice President Mike Penceto Memphis and West Tennessee this week!"
It was great to speak atLeadership Colliervilles Government Day on Wednesday.

"On Tuesday, I was honored to attend the Weakley County Commission meeting in Dresden with my friendAndy Holtto present Beth Worley VanCleave with a flag in honor of her late husband Roger VanCleave."
Commissioner VanCleave was a great man who dedicated his life to serving our country and Weakley County.
I visitedBurks Beveragein Dyer County.
Burks Beverage has been a family run business that has distributed Pepsi products since 1931.
It was great to sit down with Eddie Burks and discuss how the current economy under President Trumphas helped the future of this business.
I appreciated sitting down with Dyer County Mayor Chris Young and former Alderman Bob Kirk.
It was great to learn how I can continue to best represent Dyer County up in Washington.

These impressive new facilities will give students the proper tools and opportunities to prepare them for a brighter future.

I appreciate our visit and I look forward to working closely with you.

United States Member of Congress8thCongressionalDistrict of Tennessee                            You have received this e-mail because youhaveenrolled in our mailing list.
"       020News from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                          January 26, 2020     Dear Friend,  This past week was a District Work period."
"While I had two cataract surgeries and wasnt able to do as much as I would have liked, I still had the opportunity to attend many events in the community and meet with several leaders."
"As always, these exchanges helped me to prepare for my return to DC this week, armed with the knowledge of how I can best serve you and meet the needs of our community."
Continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf.
"Fighting for our Heroes  Last weekend, I had the honor and privilege of presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to deserving Filipino WWII Veterans who served our nation honorably and have not been treated appropriately by our government."
"When they agreed to fight under the direction of our military, they did so with President Roosevelt's guarantee that they would be treated as members of the U.S. military and would earn the same benefits as any other servicemember."
"However, after the war a subsequent U.S. President rescinded that promise."
"It wasn't until 2009 when Congress authorized a lump sum payment to these Veterans; however, many are still fighting for the care and benefits they deserve."
"While it was truly an honor to recognize their service and sacrifice, this situation remains a terrible injustice."
I will continue to fight on their behalf.
I also had the privilege of providing a brief legislative update to the Veterans' Club at Heritage Springs.
I thank these heroes for their service to our nation and appreciate their willingness to share their thoughts with me about how we can ensure Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.
It was a wonderful morning!
This alarming report is just one more reason that we need to keep investing in the critical research needed to find better treatments and a cure for ALS.
We must determine why Veterans are contracting ALS at a higher rate than non-Veterans and we must keep fighting for a cure for all patients who suffer with this catastrophic illness.
"Additionally, I agree with the author of this article that suicide rates among the Veteran community are still unacceptable."
We have to do more to support our heroes when they return from combat.
"Part of the solution is in providing alternative and complementary treatments, and we are doing that through the implementation of the COVER Act."
"However, we must do more to engage community stakeholders, which is why I am pushing for passage of the IMPROVE Act."
"This is a model that has proven successful in tackling other issues, and I believe it will help save the lives of our nations heroes."
"Preventing Homelessness  As I have said many times, fighting homelessness is a mission that is near and dear to my heart."
"Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Homeless Empowerment Program (HEP) in Clearwater."
"In addition to offering short and long-term housing options, HEP provides the wrap-around services needed to help clients attain stability."
"This includes: healthcare, mental health and substance use treatment, the chance to participate in community gardening, after school and summer camp initiatives for homeless children and financial literacy programs."
They also have specially-designed programs to assist homeless Veterans.
I look forward to working more closely with HEP and other providers as they continue their efforts to end homelessness in our community.
"Improving Healthcare Outcomes  Last week, I met with Ms. Elodie Dorso the CEO of Community Health Centers of Pinellas and Edward Kucher, the Chief Operating Officer."
"We discussed the exciting and innovative ways they are partnering with stakeholders to provide dental care, primary care and mental health/substance use treatment to residents of Pinellas and Pasco counties."
"In the past year, they have served 58,300 patients on a sliding fee scale basis."
"As a long-time supporter of the community health center model, I was eager to receive an update about the new dental clinic being built at the Tarpon Springs location."
They continue to work collaboratively to meet an urgent need in our community!
Combatting Human Trafficking  This report highlights some staggering statistics: -More than 1/5th of human trafficking victims are children (btw.
ages of 12-14)-The life expectancy for a victim after being taken is seven years-83% of human trafficking victims in our country are U.S. citizens-Florida's rate of human trafficking continues to climb These are just a of few of the many reasons that I continue to work on this tragic issue.
I've helped fund grants like the one just received in Tampa Bay to help form regional coalitions of stakeholders who work together to end human trafficking.
"We are also working at the federal level to strengthen protections for victims, raise awareness and end the facilitation of this horrific crime."
Together we can make a difference.
"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent in Hudson."
"Dear Congressman, I have had a wonderful experience with your office here in New Port Richey!"
"James and your staff made my situation, ""being declared deceased"" by Social Security , seem so much better than I expected!"
"As I explained to James, EVERYTHING in my name was frozen, deleted, or, just untouchable, thanks to something Social Security did to me."
"Your staff was more than accommodating, and I am truly appreciative in all of the hard work and dedication they put forth!"
"You should be very proud of your staff, and my wife and I are truly thankful!!"
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team enjoyed participating in last week's Grand Opening of the Tarpon Springs Distillery.
It is great to see new businesses thriving.
"Welcome to the community, Barry and Lisa Butler!"
"My team listened to Mark Gold, President of Mishorim USA and the new owner of The Grove in Wesley Chapel during this week's North Tampa Chamber's Economic Development luncheon."
Mr. Gold discussed his exciting future plans for this property.
It is wonderful to hear about the steps being taken to enhance our community.
My team was proud to help welcome the Rohr family to Pasco.
They opened a Chicken Salad Chick restaurant in Odessa-the first Pasco location.
There is one near my house in Palm Harbor and I regularly enjoy their food.
I look forward to eating at the new Pasco location as I travel throughout the district.
Welcome to the neighborhood!
My team had the pleasure of spending some time with the members of VFW Post 2550 in Dunedin.
"While there, my team provided a brief legislative update and received feedback about the newly authorized VA pilot project which will provide Veterans with expanded access to dental care."
Thank you for reading this weeks update.
Feel free to share this e-newsletter with friends and encourage them to sign up!
"                                              Dear Lindsey,  Senators Tammy Baldwin and Jim Risch (R-ID) are leading their bipartisan colleagues in standing up for Americas dairy farmers in a letter to Dr. Stephen Hahn, the new Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
"Working on behalf of dairy farmers in Wisconsin, Idaho and across the country, Senators Baldwin and Risch implored Commissioner Hahn to work with Congress to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products."
"Dairy farmers across our nation work hard to ensure their products are healthy, nutrient-dense, and in compliance with FDA regulations regarding the use of dairy terms."
"However, there are many non-dairy imitation products in the marketplace using dairy terms."
"This represents a clear violation of existing FDA rules, said Senator Baldwin and her colleagues."
"When non-dairy alternatives use dairy terms to describe their imitation products, the imitators are often assumed to have the same health benefits and nutrient levels as real dairy products."
"This is both unfair to our hardworking dairy farmers and problematic for consumers, making it harder for Americans to make educated decisions regarding what they feed themselves and their families."
"Under former Commissioner Gottlieb, the FDA began a process of reviewing how to enforce regulations defining what may be labeled a dairy product."
That process included a public comment period that has concluded.
Dairy farmers are now waiting for action from FDA.
We encourage you to move swiftly to address this unfairness and ensure that dairy terms may only be used to describe products that include dairy.
"Imposter products should no longer be able to get away with violating law and taking advantage of dairys good name, the Senators continued."
"In addition to Senators Baldwin and Risch, the letter was also signed by Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME)."
"Senators Baldwin and Risch are also lead cosponsors of the DAIRY PRIDE Act of 2019 that would require non-dairy products made from nuts, seeds, plants, and algae to no longer be mislabeled with dairy terms such as milk, yogurt or cheese."
Current FDA regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals.
"Although existing federal regulations are clear, the FDA has not enforced these labeling regulations and the mislabeling of products as milk, yogurt and cheese has increased rapidly."
This hurts dairy farmers that work tirelessly to ensure their Made in Wisconsin dairy products meet FDA standards and provide the public with nutritious food.
It has also led to the proliferation of mislabeled alternative products that contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.
"                                              Dear Lindsey,  Today, Senator Baldwin joined her bipartisan colleagues led by Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to introduce legislation to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes."
The Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act would require that e-cigarette manufacturers pay user fees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help fund more activity at FDA to conduct stronger oversight of the e-cigarette industry and increase awareness of the dangers of e-cigarettes.
"The bipartisan legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Mitt Romney (R-UT)."
"The rise of teen vaping is an epidemic and we must take action to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes and prevent them from using harmful tobacco products, said Senator Baldwin."
This legislation is an important step forward to fund stronger oversight of the e-cigarette industry and increase our prevention and youth awareness efforts.
"At Childrens Wisconsin, we have been at the front lines of caring and advocating for young people affected by the youth e-cigarette epidemic."
"In order to keep kids safe, we know more needs to be done to educate teens and their families about the dangers of vaping and to reduce teen access to all tobacco products."
We are encouraged by the provisions outlined to do just that in the Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act.
We applaud Senator Baldwin for her continued leadership in the U.S. Senate to address this troubling public health issue.
"Increased funding to support education and to encourage critical oversight and enforcement will help keep dangerous tobacco products out of our kids hands, said Mike Gutzeit, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Childrens Wisconsin."
"In recent years, the use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products, such as JUUL, has skyrocketed, particularly among teens."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that:   E-cigarette use among high school students rose from 1.5 percent of students in 2011 to 27.5 percent of students in 2019.
"E-cigarette use among middle school students also grew, from 0.6 percent of students in 2011 to 10.5 percent of students in 2019."
"The availability of flavored e-cigarettes, and easily-concealable vaping products, like JUUL, have made e-cigarettes more popular among youth."
The bipartisan Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act increases the total amount that will be collected in tobacco user fees by $100 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and indexes that amount to inflation for future years.
"Critically, the bill also authorizes FDA to collect user fees from all manufacturers of products that have been deemed as tobacco products by FDA, including e-cigarettes."
"Currently, manufacturers of traditional combustible tobacco products pay into FDA user fees, but e-cigarette companies are exempt due to a loophole in the law."
"The amount collected from individual e-cigarette manufacturers will be proportional to their share of the overall tobacco market, as determined by FDA."
This approach is consistent with the Trump administrations e-cigarette user fee proposal included in the FY 2020 Budget.
"FDA would be able to use this additional revenue from e-cigarette user fees to conduct safety reviews of vaping products, prevent sales of e-cigarettes to minors, help support efforts to educate youth on the dangers of e-cigarettes and increase the agencys oversight capabilities."
"                                       NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS Dear Friend,  Last week we saw historic trade wins with the passage of USMCA and signing of the Phase One China trade deal."
I was privileged to welcome 27 farmers to Washington from throughout the South Plains to meet with lawmakers and discuss how policies like these help support those who feed and clothe our nation.
The House is in recess and I'm looking forward to spending time with constituents during my time back home this week.
Your voice is very important and I encourage you to please reach out to my office with any thoughts or concerns you have about what is going on in our country and communities.

West Texas Farmers Fly-In Nearly 30 farmers from all across the South Plains joined me in Washington as our historic USMCAand Phase Onetrade agreement with China became a reality.
"These West Texans wanted to tell the story of the food, fuel, and fiber capital and had a special message commending Donald J. Trumpfor securing a $50B agriculture purchase commitment - 2x the amount ever purchased by China before."

I was grateful to be presented with the 2019 Wheat Advocate award.
It is an honor to represent West Texas wheat growers in Congress.
"President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush Coin Act Last week I spoke in favor of the President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush Coin Act sponsored by my friend and fellow Texan,John Cornyn."
"George and Barbara Bush were the ultimate examples of leadership, service and the purest picture of a loving and devoted marriage."
This coin will honor their lifetime of public service to our nation.
Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
"I'm grateful for Dr. Martin Luther King, an American hero, and his efforts to help us live up to our ideals as a nation that all men are created equal."
I remember learning about Dr. King as a boy.
I was moved by his courage and awe-struck by his strength of character in the face of such great persecution.
"But, what inspired me most about Dr. King was the way he chose to fight."
It was clear that his source of strength was his faith in Almighty God and his firm belief that love never fails (1 Corinthians: 13:8).
"Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative."

"USMCA Heads to the Presidents Desk for Signature On Thursday, I voted in favor of approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on the Senate floor."
The agreement was approved overwhelmingly in the Senate and will now be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature.
"Passing USMCA is a major step in implementing this 21st-century trade deal and providing needed certainty for Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers."
Over one-third of Kansas exports go to Canada and Mexico making those countries Kansas two largest export markets.
"On Jan. 3, IurgedMajority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to consider USMCA as soon as it passed out of the appropriate Senate committees."
"I voted Wednesday in both the Senate Appropriations and Commerce Committees to pass USMCA, moving it to the full Senate for a vote."
I appreciate Senate leaders listening to my request and quickly moving this important trade agreement to a vote on the Senate floor.
"Over the past two years, I have consistently advocated for a deal like USMCA to be reached."
"I have heard directly from many Kansas producers on the vital importance of a modern trade deal that expands export opportunities, and I applaud President Trumps work to get this trade deal accomplished."
"To view the timeline of my efforts on a modern trade deal, clickhere."
"Update Regarding the Impeachment TrialAt noon on Thursday, seven House managers delivered and read the articles of impeachment to the Senate."
"Shortly after 2 p.m., Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was escorted into the Senate chamber and sworn in as the presiding officer."
"After he was sworn in, Chief Justice Roberts swore in each U.S."
Senator and then we individually signed the oath book.
The oath represents a pledge to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law.
I take this oath and responsibility seriously.
"The impeachment trial will officially begin on Tuesday, January 21, 2020."
The Senate will first set the rules of the trial and then we will move to oral arguments.
The trial will be held every day at 1 p.m.
"ET, Monday through Saturday, until we reach a verdict or dismiss the charges."
"Meeting with NASA Astronauts, including Kansan Nick Hague On Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet with NASA Astronauts Anne McClain and Nick Hague."
Both recently served as flight engineers on expeditions to the International Space Station.
Astronaut Hague is a Kansas native and graduated from Hoxie High School in 1994 before serving in the United States Air Force.
"During Expedition 59/60, Hague conducted three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 56 minutes with a total of 203 days in space before returning to Earth in October 2019."
"After he returned to Earth, I took the opportunity to speak with him over the phone to tell him how proud Kansans are of him and how often I get to brag about his accomplishments serving our country."
"It was great to talk with Astronaut Hague again and as Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee on Appropriations, I enjoyed getting a chance to discuss both of their missions and the resources that are vital to their success."
"At the end of our meeting, Astronaut Hague presented me with a Kansas flag that was flown by him at the International Space Station."
I look forward to displaying the Kansas flag in my office and having the opportunity to share this with the many Kansans who visit my office.
"Attending the Signing Ceremony for the Phase One China Trade Agreement  On Wednesday, the United States and China signed an historic trade agreement that will open new trade opportunities for farmers and manufacturers across Kansas."
I was pleased to join President Trump at the White House for the signing ceremony.
This agreement includes a commitment by China to purchase at least $40 billion annually in agricultural products from the United States each of the next two years.
"This agreement is also a first step in addressing Chinas misbehavior on trade, such as the theft of American intellectual property and forced technology transfer."
Congress must work to make certain China lives up to its agreement and hold China accountable if its bad behavior continues.
I will continue to urge the administration to reach an agreement with China that removes U.S. tariffs and Chinas retaliatory tariffs that are damaging to Kansas.
"Attending the American Farm Bureau Federations Annual Convention This weekend, I attended the American Farm Bureau Federations Annual Convention to speak with farmers and ranchers from across the United States about making certain rural America has a voice in Congress."
"An important part of this conversation centered around access to healthcare and broadband, which allows the rural way of life to be sustained."
"It was also great to discuss the recent vote by the Senate to approve USMCA, ensuring further trade certainty for farmers."
I also highlighted my trip to the White House for the signing of Phase One of the China trade agreement by President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He which should be significant for the economic well being of farmers and the U.S. economy.
"Town Hall Project Announces 2019 Awards  This past week, Town Hall Project released their end of year report and announced that I held 73 town hall meetings in 2019  the most town halls of any member of Congress."
"Each town hall had to meet the criteria of having at least a twenty-four hour notice, being open to the public and feature at least 30 minutes of open QA."
"Town halls are a part of my Kansas Listening Tour, a priority throughout my time in Kansas to stay connected to the Kansans I represent."
"Every Congressional session, I visit each of Kansas 105 counties, and the conversations I have help drive the work I do in Washington, D.C."
Thank you to each Kansan that I have spoken with during my time in Congress for sharing your thoughts and ideas with me.
I look forward to many more Kansas Listening Tour stops in 2020.
"Recognized as a 2019 Wheat Advocate  On Thursday, I met with representatives from Kansas Wheat Commission."
"During the meeting we discussed a variety of issues, including the importance of trade and exports to Kansas farmers, the Federal Grain Inspection Service reauthorization, international food aid and federal funding for wheat research."
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, I secured resources for critical wheat research initiatives, including the Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative, which develops control measures forFusariumhead blight, or scab."
I was also honored to be presented with the 2019 Wheat Advocate Award from the National Association of Wheat Growers during the meeting.
"Our wheat growers are critical to the global foodsupply, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside Kansas Wheat Commission to improve the outlook for agriculture in Kansas."
Announcing the Addition of Two District Representatives  Two new district representatives have joined my team to serve northeast Kansas.
Susan Metsker will primarily work on behalf of Kansans to address any concerns or issues they may encounter with a federal agency.
"Jason Osterhaus will serve as a contact and representative at community events and meetings for Shawnee, Douglas, Wyandotte, Miami, Lyon, Ottawa, Osage, Jackson and Jefferson Counties."
They join State Director Alex Richard and District Representative Michele Payne in representing the northeast region of Kansas out of the Olathe office.
"Susan Metsker, District Representative:Metsker previously served 12 years as a member of the Shawnee Mission School District Board of Education and currently serves on the Board of Directors for Inclusion Connections."
Metsker served as a district representative for Congressman Kevin Yoder for eight years and prior to that she worked nearly 20 years in development for a non-profit youth organization.
Metsker holds a Masters in Public Administration from the University of Kansas.
"Jason Osterhaus, District Representative:Osterhaus, a resident of Overland Park, served on the Johnson County Commission for the past eight years where he worked to oversee the Johnson County Library Master Plan, expand the Johnson County Mental Health Department, including the Veterans Treatment Courts, supported the construction of the New Johnson County Courthouse and Coroners Facility, and corrected the understaffing of the Johnson County Sheriffs office."
"Previously, Osterhaus worked at Sprint and Perceptive Software."

"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                       January 19, 2020 This past week saw several history-making moments occur as the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), becoming the 38th state needed to finally ratify the ERA to the U.S. Constitution, and the U.S. House of Representatives approved a slate of managers to try the impeachment case against President Donald J. Trump in the U.S. Senate."
"As the latter unfolded, we also saw new evidence turned over to the House Intelligence Committee, on which I serve, that further provesthat the President was driving the effort to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political opponent by withholding critically needed military aid and funds approved by Congress for our ally."
"This week also saw my colleagues and I in the House take action to protect student borrowers who have been defrauded by predatory colleges and who were further violated by the Trump Administration's Borrower Defense rule, which made it even more difficult for students to qualify for and access student loan debt relief."
We also voted to protect older Americans' rights to fight against age discrimination on an even playing field when in court.
This year will bring many more votes and workto ensure that hard-working Americans and their families are able to benefit from the same opportunities as thePresident's donor classand that our democracy and Constitution continue tostand strong.
Rest assured that my Democratic colleagues and I will continue to do everything we can to resist this Administration's attacks onour core democratic principles and norms.
It's more important than ever that we stand up for what is right and just and we will not falter in our duty.

"Votes and Legislative Highlights Virginia Ratifies the Equal Rights Amendment in a Historic Vote This week, the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), becoming the crucial 38th state needed to ratify the ERA to the Constitution."
The ERA affirms our commitment to womens equality and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.
This historic vote proves that there is no expiration date on equality and this issue is as salient as ever.
"For survivors of sexual violence, pregnancy discrimination, unequal pay, and more, the fight for equal justice under the law cant wait any longer."
"The Archivist must act swiftly to certify the ERA and Congress must pass my bill, H.J."
Res 79 to eliminate any legal ambiguities by striking the deadline for ratification.
The bill is cosponsored by 224 bipartisan Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have introduced a companion joint resolution in the U.S. Senate.
"Voted to Protect Student Borrowers Defrauded by Predatory Colleges This week, House Democrats passed legislation to overturn the Trump Administrations harmful Borrower Defense rule that makes it more difficult for defrauded students to qualify for and access debt relief."
"All too often, predatory for-profit colleges leave student borrowers high and dry."
"With overwhelming debt and useless credentials, these students struggle to find work."
Current law and rules put into place by the Obama Administration recognize the special challenges facing defrauded students and entitle them to relief from the loans they took out in good faith.
"Unfortunately, Secretary DeVos refused to implement these life-changing policies for over a year and then issued a rule officially rolling back many of the provisions that allowed students to qualify for debt relief."
"76, the first use of the Congressional Review Act since Democrats took back the majority, restores the policies that hold predatory colleges accountable and allows students to move forward with their lives."
Students and their families are counting on the Senate to do the right thing and take up this critical legislation.
"Voted for House Impeachment Managers to Transmit Articles On Wednesday, in a historic vote, the House approved a slate of House managers to try the impeachment case in a trial against President Donald J. Trump in the Senate."
"Later that day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the managers held a formal engrossment ceremony certifying the articles of impeachment and then, in the Speakers words, prepared to cross a very important threshold in American History."
This included ceremonially processing through the central artery of the Capitol Building to deliver the articles to the Senate.
"The House managers, led by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, include Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Zoe Lofgren of California, Sylvia Garcia of Texas, Val Demings of Florida, and Jason Crow of Colorado."
The team brings a diversity of experiences and talent to this demanding role and I trust that they will present the most powerful and convincing possible case against the President before the Senate.
The process in the Senate began with an oath the Senators take to be impartial.
The trial will begin next week with consideration of the rules.
"If the President is convicted by two-thirds of the Senate, he will be removed from office."
"Meanwhile, even more evidence has emerged that further corroborates the two articles of impeachment against the President for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress."
"Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump personal attorney and shadow diplomat Rudy Giuliani, has turned away from the President and answered the call of duty to deliver truth and justice to the American peoplejust like Michael Cohen did last year when he spoke out about Trumps illegal hush-money payments."
"This time, the stakes are even more grave as the evidence Parnas has given directly implicates the President in the scheme to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Trumps political rival."
"On Tuesday night, the House Intelligence Committee released documents obtained from Parnas showing Parnas involvement in the campaign to oust Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into the Bidens."
"Lev Parnas then went on the record in an interview with The New York Times stating, I am betting my whole life that Trump knew exactly everything that was going on."
It is unbelievable that the Republicans in the Senate continue to resist having Parnas and other witnesses such as Bolton take the stand in the Senate trial.
"In order to maintain our constitutional sense of justice, it is critical that the whole truth is presented to the Senate and the American people."
"Voted for Legislation to Protect Older Americans from Discrimination This week, I voted in favor of the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act to restore the rights of older Americans to achieve justice for age discrimination."
"Prior to 2009, older workers faced the same mixed-motive burden of proof as those who alleged discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or religion."
"In Gross v. FBL Financial Services, the Supreme Court imposed a new single-motive standard that made it substantially more difficult to prove age discrimination, sending a dangerous message that some forms of discrimination are more permissive than others."
This bill simply restores Congressional intent by returning to the original burden of proof.
Im proud to support this legislation because all workers deserve safe and equal workplaces free from harassment and discrimination!
Attended Armed Services Committee Hearing on Strategic Competition with China    Meeting with Jackie Spoke with UNITE HERE about Challenges Facing Airline Food Service Workers  Many of the UNITE HERE airline catering workers want to strike but have been held in mediation for two years.
"The Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee held a hearing on Wednesday, conducting oversight of the working conditions of airline ground workers, where UNITE HERE, SEIU, and the Communications Workers of America testified to the stories of countless workers facing low wages and subpar health care coverage despite record profits in the airline industry."
I will continue to press to ensure that workers have a voice because one job should be enough to live a life of dignity.

"Quick Links This week, the Senate finally had the opportunity to vote on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."
"It passed with broad, bipartisan support and will soon head to President Trump's desk to be signed into law.USMCA preserves critical, duty-free access to Mexico and Canada."
And it removes unfair restrictions on U.S. farm and food products.
"For the first time ever, U.S. eggs and dairy exports will be sold in Canada."
This is very good news.
Watch my full floor speech on the passage here.
I had the opportunity toattend the White House signing ceremony for Phase One of a trade deal between the United States and China.Farmers have borne the brunt of retaliation throughout this trade war.
"I hope this proves to be a turning point in our economic relationship with China, but Ive seen enough history to be clear-eyed."
"Not only must China follow through with its commitments in this Phase One deal, but also work toward a comprehensive agreement that ends forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft and unfair restrictions on U.S. goods, including agriculture."
Only then will we know if China can be a reliable economic partner in the 21st century.
"As president pro tempore of the Senate, it was my duty to preside over the start of the presidential impeachment trial that began on Thursday."
"I oversaw the presentation of articles and administered the trial oath to Chief Justice Roberts, who will now preside for the rest of the trial."
                                       A Somber Moment for Our Country This week marked the beginning of the Senate impeachment trial.
"On Thursday, I joined my fellow Senators in taking an oath to be impartial, to abide by our countrys values, and to uphold our Constitution."
"This is a somber moment for our country, and I will approach this grave responsibility with the thoughtfulness and thoroughness that the people of New Hampshire expect and that the Constitution demands."
"To fulfill that responsibility, I will continue calling for a fair and thorough trial that ensures that Senators and the American people  have full access to all relevant information and facts."
"I hope that my Republican colleagues will join me in supporting a fair trial, including hearing from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the Presidents actions, in particular Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton."
"As this trial proceeds, Congress should continue to work on the issues that I hear from Granite Staters about every day, which is why I was pleased that the Senate voted this week on a bipartisan basis to advance the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)."
"I voted to pass this critical agreement earlier this month as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, and now that it has passed the full Senate it will head to the Presidents desk for his final signature."
"I supported this bipartisan deal because it will help to level the playing field for New Hampshire businesses and consumers, support our small businesses and dairy farmers, and cut red tape for our businesses."
"Additionally, it includes key labor and environmental enforcement standards."
I will keep working with members of both parties on critical priorities to expand opportunity for all Granite Staters and all Americans.
"With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan  What the Senator is Working On The Senate passed bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Senator Hassan to help ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to curb the opioid epidemic and better target fentanyl and similar synthetic drugs, which have contributed to the devastating substance misuse epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country."
Senator Hassan led a bipartisan group of her colleagues in introducing a bipartisan bill to help state and local entities prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats by requiring the Department of Homeland Security to establish a Cybersecurity State Coordinator in New Hampshire and all 50 states.
"Senator Hassan, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management, voted to confirm Peter Gaynor as the next Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)."
"Photo of the Week This week, Senator Hassan visited Rockingham Brewing Company in Derry, where she had the chance to tour the facility and speak to local brewers about the recent federal extension of craft beverage tax cuts that she successfully advocated for."
"This craft beverage tax cut extension will help New Hampshires small breweries continue to thrive, and Senator Hassan is continuing to advocate for a permanent extension of these tax cuts."

This trade deal culminates a three-year-long effort by the Trump administration to rebalance our trade relationship with China.
"Prior to this deal, the U.S. trade relationship with China suffered from cybertheft of U.S. intellectual property, forced technology transfers, and inadequate market access to U.S. businesses."
"With this Phase One trade deal, China has committed to purchasing roughly $200 billion of U.S. goods while promising to implement structural reforms and other changes to their economic and trade regime."
"In particular, the deal dramatically expands U.S. agriculture and food exports to China."
Im optimistic this Phase One trade deal will usher in free and fair trade with China and bring economic growth to the Central Valley.
I look forward to the Trump administrations continued efforts to deliver strong and enforceable trade deals for all Americans.

"Senator Rick Scott Applauds Decision to Make Bases Safer, Pushes for Hard Reset of Foreign National Training Program  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after an update on the findings of the FBI investigation into the shooting at NAS Pensacola last month."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Im glad federal officials are taking steps to make our bases safer, including sending a number of potentially dangerous individuals back to their home country."
"This is a positive step, but more must be done when it comes to addressing the failures in this program that led to the tragic terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola."
"Given the FBIs confirmation that a number of Saudi nationals engaged in troubling conduct, its clear we need a hard reset."
Im calling on the Saudi government to recall all Saudi nationals training in the U.S. back to their home country until the Department of Defense can conduct a full review of the program.
I will continue to work with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Inhofe and administration officials to get to the bottom of exactly what went wrong so we can figure out if these training programs are safe to continue.Read more HERE.
"Sen.

"They are actively trying to use strategic relationships to advance their geopolitical and economic goals, which threatens our nations security."
I appreciate the responses Ive received from some Florida universities detailing the steps they are taking to protect their information from Communist China.
But Im still waiting to hear from many universities in Florida.
"Everyone needs to understand this risk, and I look forward to hearing back from every institution as we work to protect our universities and our students.Read more HERE."
Senator Rick Scott Statement on China Trade Deal  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the Presidents signing of Phase 1 of the China trade deal.
"Senator Rick Scott said, I applaud the President for trying to negotiate deals that put American businesses first."
But Communist China never lives up to its commitments and I dont believe they will honor this deal.
"Communist China is militarizing the South China Sea, breaking the agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom, and attacking religious freedom by detaining possibly more than one million Uyghurs in internment and re-education camps."
Our relationship with China is about more than just trade.
We have to talk about human rights and we have to talk about Chinas growing influence around the world.
The United States has been down this road before with Communist China.
"They never live up to their agreements, so why should we believe them now?Read more HERE."
Sen. Rick Scott on the Peace Corps Ending Programs in Communist China: Im Glad They Finally Came to Their Senses  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Peace Corps announced its decision to wind down operations in Communist China.
"This decision follows months of Senator Scott calling for the Peace Corps to get out of Communist China, and the introduction of Senator Scotts Peace Corps Mission Accountability Act, which prohibits all Peace Corps activity in hostile countries, including Communist China."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Im glad the Peace Corps has finally come to its senses and sees Communist China for what it is: the second largest economy in the world and an adversary of the United States."
"Communist China continues to be a horrible human rights violator, one of the largest polluters in the world and a geopolitical threat."
There is no reason we should prop up our adversaries with U.S. tax dollars.
"Ive repeatedly asked the Peace Corps to pull all volunteers and resources from Communist China immediately, and Im glad they finally decided to start protecting both taxpayer money and the American people."
I will also be asking the Peace Corps to present their plan to me to ensure a speedy withdrawal of their resources in Communist China.Read more HERE.

"Watch video from the hearing HERE.Senator Rick Scott said, Im proud the Senate passed the USMCA as we work with the Administration to negotiate trade agreements that put American businesses first."

I will not stop fighting until Florida growers have what they need to succeed.Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott on Fox: Congress Needs to Stop Wasting Time on Impeachment and Get Back to WorkWatch the full interview HERE or below.
"Sen. Rick Scott: My Fathers Fight for Freedom During World War II Continues to Inspire Me  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for Fox News about his father, a World War II hero, who inspires him to fight for freedom every day."
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, My dads story is the story of many in his generation."
Kicked out of his house at9because his parents got divorced and neither could afford to feed him.
He grew up during theDepressionwith almost nothing by moving in with family and friends.
He joined the Army as a teenager.
"But I often wonder if he recognized how important he, and those like him, were to the fabric of American society.I think for my dad, a man who never had any financial success, World War II was a time he felt important."
"We seldom give credit to the men and women who struggle financially and simply show up,dayin and dayout,doing the best they can."
I think thats a mistake.
"They are the foundation of a country that always yearns for more, for better."
"The forgotten men and women not only must not be forgotten, but they must also be appreciated, valued."
"Lastmonth,I went to Luxembourgforthe 75thanniversary of the Battle of the Bulge."
I learned about the German surprise attack on American troops.
About how American troops were initially outnumbered three to one.
About Germans massacring unarmed American prisoners of war.
About the lack of food and medicine.
About the bitter cold and snow.
Aboutsleeping in foxholeswith nowinter clothing.
I always loved my dad.
I was always proud of him.
"But as I learned more about what he and others did to make sure we have the freedoms weenjoy,I was even more awe-inspired."
Freedom is fleeting and worth fighting for.
"I hope we will never forget theprimary goal of thefederal governmentis to provide for the common defense,so our children and grandchildren live in freedom and peace, and our sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters never have to fight in the dead of winter for American freedom."

Sen. Rick Scott to Floridians: Thank You for the Opportunity to Work on Your Behalf  Senator Rick Scott wrote and op-ed reflecting on his first year in the United States Senate and thanking Floridians for the opportunity to fight for them in Washington.
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, ""...This year, we got some big wins for Florida."
"Following my questions at a Homeland Security Committee hearing, the FBI finally acknowledged they held their employees accountable for mistakes prior to the Parkland shooting, and revamped and improved their tip center process."
The Federal Department of Transportation made significant investments in Floridas infrastructure and I fought to secure the full $200 million for Everglades restoration.
"In December, President Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which included a number of provisions that I fought for, such as an authorization of over $1.5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base, a well-deserved raise for our military, a provision to hold Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro accountable and a restriction on buying Chinese products that are a risk to our safety and security."
I know my job: make life better for the 22 million who call Florida home.
"Forcing the federal government to embrace competence, efficiency and common sense will not be easy."
But we have to do it.
"Thank you for the opportunity to work on your behalf."""

"A special thank you to Martin County Sheriff's Office Sgt.Timothy BaltesandWalton County Sheriffs Offices newest K-9 officer, Colt, for going above and beyond the call of duty!"
"        Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window                      January 14, 2020  Dear Friend,  It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate."
Last week was a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues Ive been working on.
"War with Iran is Not in Americas Interest    Senator Shaheen questions witnesses during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  First and foremost, Im very relieved that no U.S. personnel were lost in last weeks attacks by Iran on Iraqi military bases housing U.S. service members."
I strongly condemn Iran for these attacks.
We have 80 New Hampshire National Guard soldiers deployed throughout the Middle East supporting U.S. and Allied operations -they are top of mind for me as Iran continues to threaten U.S. forces.
"As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, I continue to urge the administration to step back from the brink with Iran and take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of our service members and diplomats in the region."
The Trump administration also needs to lay out a comprehensive policy towards Iran and the Middle East more broadly.
The United States shouldnt stumble into armed conflict because a war is not in Americas or Irans interest.
"And in keeping with the Constitution, Im calling for Congress to require a vote before any decision is made to go to war."
"Bipartisan Progress to Improve U.S. Trade with Canada and Mexico    Senator Shaheen examines a ground penetrating radar device during her visit to Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. in Nashua  International trade has long spurred New Hampshires economy, creating good paying jobs and opportunities for small businesses."
"In reviewing the details of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal - during meetings with New Hampshire business owners, labor leaders and community members - I weighed heavily whether this agreement was in the best interest of our state."
Last week I announced that I plan to vote in favor of this trade agreement.
"It has been substantially improved by the priorities pressed by Democratic leaders in negotiations with the Trump administration, and it makes improvements to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that will help empower Granite State businesses while protecting American workers and safeguarding our environment."
Im glad to see bipartisan progress on this issue and hope we can build on this work in Congress by addressing the many other critical concerns impacting middle-class families throughout the country.
"Supporting Law Enforcement Officers Access to Mental Health Services   Senator Shaheen participating in a law enforcement resiliency roundtable at the Nashua Police Department  Each day, our police officers dedicate themselves to protecting and serving their communities."
"On the job, police officers experience tremendous stress and trauma that is all too often hidden from their peers and families."
"According to a recent study by the mental health organization Blue H.E.L.P., 228 American police officers died by suicide last year - a staggering statistic that surpassed the number of law enforcement who were killed in the line of duty."
"Each one of these officers represents a family member, friend and loved one."
"As this figure was compiled using only public reports, the actual total number of suicides may be higher than we know."
This is a crisis that demands the attention of Congress.
"As the lead Democrat of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice and allocates federal resources to our law enforcement communities, I fought for more resources in the government funding bill signed into law in December to boost access to mental health services for officers."
I also worked to include text that for the first time will require the Department of Justice to collect data on police suicides so that we can have a better understanding of the scope of this crisis.
"While these are positive steps forward, there is so much more that needs to be done."
"We have a commitment to support the brave men and women who protect us, and I will never stop fighting for them."
"Bipartisan Action to Lower Insulin Prices  For Americans with diabetes, there is no alternative to insulin -it can be the difference between life and death for millions of Americans."
The skyrocketing price of this lifesaving drug means that many Americans are rationing or even foregoing taking their insulin.
This is unacceptable -no one should have to choose between purchasing their medication and putting food on the table.
Thats why I have worked to lower these exorbitant costs.
"During negotiations on the government funding legislation signed into law last month, I joined forces with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) to include a provision prohibiting insulin manufacturers from gaming the system to block generic, more affordable versions of their products from coming to the market."
"In addition, our provision will help lower costs by improving and streamlining the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) approval process for new cheaper forms of insulin."
Ill continue to work across the aisle to build on this progress and will keep fighting for more federal investments to treat and ultimately cure this disease.
"Further Exposing a Dark Money Campaign that Sought to Undermine Bipartisan Efforts to Combat Surprise Medical Billing   During Senate floor remarks, Senator Shaheen calls out the dark money campaign against Congressional action on surprise medical billing  In New Hampshire and across the country, millions of families have been impacted by the scourge of surprise medical bills, which often cost thousands of dollars and can easily put a family budget in the red."
"As bipartisan work is underway in Congress to stop this unfair practice, there are private equity firms on Wall Street that want to preserve the status quo which allows them to continue to reap enormous profits."
These firms have flooded New Hampshire and states across the country with ads funded by dark money that seek to undermine bipartisan progress in Congress.
"Last week, their shameless campaign to drown out the voices of patients who have received surprise medical bills, mislead Americans and derail Congressional action was further exposed."
Ill keep working to get dark money out of politics and continue to reach across the aisle to finish the work weve started to address surprise medical billing.
Its past time that Congress address health care costs for Granite Staters and ignore the special interests.
Contact My Office  One of my most important responsibilities as a U.S.
Senator is assisting New Hampshire residents who need help navigating federal agencies.
"Ive worked with my staff to help Granite Staters avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, deliver delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance, and access VA benefits, among many other services."
"If you have an issue with a federal agency, you can open a casehere."
"If it is time-sensitive, you can call my Manchester office at (603) 647-7500."
"Here are a few testimonials from Granite Staters who have been helped: George Palmer, Londonderry: George is a Korean War veteran who was having trouble receiving VA benefits that he earned during his military service."
"After his daughter contacted my office on his behalf, my staff reached out to the VA to investigate and followed up repeatedly to keep Georges case on their radar."
"Eventually, George not only received a positive decision on his claim, but was also awarded retroactive compensation to make up for lost benefits which will help his family care for him in the years to come."
"Robert Jelley, Somersworth: Roberts daughter, SueAnn, contacted my staff because he was having trouble obtaining a decision from the VA on a disability claim."
"Working with his daughter and a VA liaison, my staff helped secure Robert the full disability benefits he deserved."
"Debra Kraytenberg, Londonderry: Debra connected with my office to request assistance to renew her daughters passport."
"She was hoping to travel abroad with her family very soon, but was experiencing delays in getting a response from the National Passport Center (NPC)."
"My staff immediately made an inquiry on Debras daughters behalf, working to resolve the issue that was holding up the processing of her passport."
"After my staff made contact with the NPC and inquired on Debra and her daughters behalf, the NPC approved the passport and the Kraytenbergs were able to go on their family vacation."

" News from Representative Luria                                       DearLindsey,   I am excited to tell you about this past week in Congress!"
"From advocating for a bill to clean our drinking water to voting to secure our telecommunication networks, there is so much to tell you."
Scroll down for a recap!
"Championing Legislation to Protect Our Drinking Water    Earlier this week, I voted for the PFAS Action Act of 2019 (H.R."
"This bipartisan bill, which I cosponsored, would take steps to clean sites contaminated by hazardous per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) across Coastal Virginia and America."
The PFAS Action Act will require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to list several categories of PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the Superfund program.
It also requires the EPA to set enforceable limits on the levels of certain PFAS in drinking water and direct federal resources to clean sites contaminated by PFAS.
"Within five years of the bill's enactment, it would instruct the EPA to make a final decision on the safety status of all remaining categories of PFAS."
This bill also authorizes $800 million in appropriations for entities that help fund infrastructure upgrades that reduce PFAS exposure.
"In Hampton Roads, PFAS are a clear and present threat to our servicemembers and their families."
The PFAS Action Act is an important step toward addressing this public health issue with the attention and urgency that it demands.
"I am pleased to vote for this legislation, and I will continue to prioritize the long-term health of Coastal Virginians by protecting our drinking water from this carcinogenic contaminant."
"Safeguarding American Telecommunications from Foreign Threats    On Wednesday, I voted to secure our telecommunications infrastructure from foreign privacy and security threats, a growing problem as our nation transitions to 5th generation telecommunications (5G)."
I was pleased to announce the House passage of several bills that promote our national security interests by ensuring that America sets the international standards for 5G telecommunications.
"The implementation of 5G telecommunications will revolutionize the way Americans communicate, send, and receive valuable information."
"As these technologies are rolled out, America must implement international standards to protect the security of our nation and our allies from foreign interference."
I am proud to vote to expand Americas role as a key leader in setting these international regulations.
"Engaging with Constituents    Over the past year, I have had the honor of meeting and connecting with countless constituent organizations."
"During 2019, my office and I hosted 1,195 constituent meetings."
This was the second most constituent meetings held by a freshman representative.
I am proud of our active presence in the community and I am looking forward to meeting with many more constituents!
"Mobile Office Hours in Virginia Beach and Nassawadox    This week, our team is hosting mobile office hours in Virginia Beach and Nassawadox."
"We are eager to assist you with federal issues including Social Security, veterans' affairs, Medicaid, and more."
"For more information, please see below!"
Virginia Beach Mobile Office Hours      Nassawadox Mobile Office Hours      AmeriCorps Community Service in Chincoteague    I am happy to announce that the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) has begun important work on the Eastern Shore.
AmeriCorps NCCC is a full time residential service program that strengthens communities through community service.
"Last Friday, an NCCC team began a project at the Chincoteague Wildlife Refuge to replace 17 miles of fencing that holds 150 horses."
The team's work will prevent overgrazing and support the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company.
"On Wednesday, our office held mobile office hours in James City County."
I was excited to hear that a constituent visited to thank us for our help.
"In June, Nancy contacted our office and we were able to save her money in social security benefits!"
I enjoyed stopping by Coreys Chicken Shack in James City County!

"Sincerely,       P.S."
"Around the Eighth District and Washington Here's a close look at a few of the highlights from my week:  On Monday, I was honored to attend the annual Sea of Blue Memorial in Tipton County for fallenTennessee Highway PatrolTrooper Calvin Jenks."
Trooper Jenks was killed in the line of duty thirteen years ago while performing a routine traffic stop.
This was a humbling and important reminder of the dangers of the profession and the sacrifices our law enforcement officers make every day to keep us safe.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Jenks family.
It was good to sit-down with Matt Mika and Chuck Penry withTyson Foods this week to discuss their new Gibson County location.
"Tysons new complex will bring great economic opportunity to West Tennessee, and I look forward to continuing to work with Tyson."

United States Member of Congress8thCongressionalDistrict of Tennessee                              You have received this e-mail because youhaveenrolled in our mailing list.
"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                          January 12, 2020 This week's return to session saw my colleagues in the House and I take one of the most consequential votes any Member of Congress can cast, a vote to avert the President's reckless and willfully-ignorant march to war."
"President Trump put us on a perilous path that remains fraught with tension and places the more than 65,000 military servicemembers and embassy staff in the region at grave risk."
It all goes back to his heedlessly petty withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear dealwhich was workingand the alienation of our longstanding allies and partners.
"When Iran lashed out in response, Trump doubled down and killed a senior Iranian leader, setting off Irans latest retaliation and galvanizing people in the region against the U.S. who had, until just last week, been demonstrating against the regime.The question everyone should be asking is whether the President's rash foreign policy decision, and his presidency overall, have made us more safe."
"That is why I proudly joined 224 of my colleagues, including severalRepublicans, who voted to reassert Congress' constitutional war powers to prevent further escalation ofa conflict that the American people do not want."
"Our message was clear: The Constitution gives Congress, and only Congress, the power to declare war."
"That was far from the only business conducted in the House, as you will see below."
"My colleaguesand I took action on limiting PFAS chemical exposure, though there is far more that must be done to address this public health threat."
We alsovoted toadvance 5G technology to keep America globally competitive.
And we continued to fight against Senator Mitch McConnell's and President Trump's jointscheme to undermine the Senate impeachment trial process and keepthefacts of the President'smisconduct and corruption hidden from the American people.
Next weekwillbe just as busy so make sureyou check outthe next Jackie's DC Dashboard.

"Votes and Legislative Highlights Reasserted Congress Constitutional Powers to Prevent War On Thursday, the House passed Congresswoman Elissa Slotkins resolution by a vote of 224-194to prevent the President from initiating military actions against Iran, which I voted for and co-sponsored."
"This bipartisan vote sends a strong message to President Trump that we will not tolerate dangerous foreign policy whims that cannot be justified as ""imminent."""
"Like so many of you who have reached out in the wake of this escalation, I remain deeply concerned for the safety of more than 65,000 Americans stationed in the region as well as the security of the nation."
We are less safe than we were two years ago and the Presidentcannot be trusted to continue managing the crisis he created.
I hope that our Republican colleagues in the Senate will respect Congresss constitutional authority on this matter and do what is right.
"Impeachment Update: Standoff Between Chambers on Trial Rules With our return to session this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued to hold the articles of impeachment that the House approved in December and that accuse the President of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress."
"Before sending over the articles to initiate the Senate trial, Speaker Pelosi has rightly insisted that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put forward fair trial rules that include subpoenaing documents and testimony from witnesses."
Sen. McConnell wants to avoid a full and fair trial at all costs because it would expose even more details about the corrupt and treacherous schemes of President Trump.
"To that end, Sen. McConnell has been working closely with the White House to rig the trial for an easy acquittal."
"This is a travesty and makes a mockery of the Constitution and the Senate Rules that require Senators to swear an oath to be impartial jurors that states, ."
Its an oath Sen. McConnell and other Republicans have violated before the trial even begins by colluding with the defendant.
"Since the House vote in December, further evidence has come to light underscoring the need for subpoenaed witnesses and documents to be presented at the Senate trial to ensure a fair process that provides the American people with the truth."
"First, it was revealed that documents produced by the Administration in response to court orders redacted the most incriminating emailsthe textbook definition of a coverup."
"And former National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that he would testify at the Senate trial if a subpoena were issued, to provide us with new information about President Trumps interactions with Ukraine."
"President Trump initially said would be up to the Senate to determine witnesses, but then indicated that he would seek to block Boltons testimony."
Please knowthat my Democratic colleagues and I will notgive up on our search for the truthand congressional oversight duties.
"Voted to Regulate Harmful Forever Chemicals and Protect Consumers This week, the House took long-overdue action to regulate PFAS, a class of thousands of chemicals that accumulate in the environment and in our bodies."
"In spite of extensive evidence that PFAS are associated with adverse health impacts, the EPA has failed to take meaningful regulatory action to protect Americans and their families."
"While servicemembers and communities located near military facilities are particularly at risk of PFAS exposure, the CDC estimates that a staggering 98 percent of the US population already have PFAS in their blood."
"On Thursday, I voted to take an important first step toward addressing thiscontamination with the PFAS Action Act of 2019."
This groundbreaking legislation would force the EPA to set a safe drinking water limit for PFAS that takes into consideration particularly vulnerable populations.
"It would also designate PFAS as a hazardous substance under the SUPERFUND law, a tool for cleaning up contaminated sites and ensuring that polluters bear responsibility for the brunt of remedial costs."
"Critically, this legislation also contains provisions to promote accountability from chemical manufacturers, ensure transparency for consumers, and support communities with contaminated water sources."
"If passed by the Senate, the PFAS Action Act will go a long way toward addressing PFAS pollution in our water and air."
"However, wemust still fight to ensure that common household items such as cookware, food wrappings, and personal care items like cosmetics and sunscreen are PFAS free and safe for consumers!"
"Voted to Advance 5G Communications Infrastructure and Security On Wednesday, I voted in favor of a package of bills addressing the advancements of fifth-generation (5G) technologies  the future of the global telecommunications market."
China has taken great efforts to advance their 5G networks and its imperative for the United States to do the same and then some.
"This package of bills will help ensure adherence to international security recommendations adopted at the Prague 5G Security Conference, develop a 5G security strategy in consultation with our intelligence community, and support U.S. leadership at international 5G standards-setting bodies."
Congress must ensure that America remains a global leader for new technologies and I will continue to work so that our District  in the heart of Silicon Valley  continues to set the trends and be ahead of the curve.
"Oversight Hearing on Census Efforts to Reach Hard-to-Count Communities On Thursday, in the Oversight Committee, I heard from public advocacy groups on the preparedness of the 2020 Census, and the Census Bureaus efforts to reach hard-to-count communities."
"The Census is crucial to distributing over $1.5 trillion a year in federal support for housing, health care, education, and so much more that is needed to build strong communities."
"Instead of dedicating efforts to ensuring an accurate count, this Administration frittered away years in an effort to bias the count and silence immigrant communities with a citizenship question."
"Because they failed to focus on the job at hand, they now are playing catch-up to hire census employees and engage in outreach necessary for a full and accurate count."
The silver lining of Thursdays hearing was the testimony of civic advocates engaged in grassroots efforts to reach hard-to-count communities and make sure they are counted.
The House Oversight Committee will continue to engage in oversight of the Census Bureau to pressure them to do their job and get an accurate count.
"Meetings with Jackie Congressional Offices Implementing the #MeToo Congress Act This week, I met with leadership of the Office of Employee Advocacy and Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which is responsible for helping to ensure legislative branch employees rights are respected and the dispute resolution process is fair."
"I heard an update on implementation of the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) Reform Act, which was based on my #MeToo Congress Act to finally rein in the scourge of harassment and discrimination in the halls of Congress."
"I was pleased to hear that the new Office of Employee Advocacy, which now provides legal advice and representation to complainants, is being utilized and well-received by employees and that Office of Congressional Workplace Rights changes are coming along smoothly."
I will continue to conduct oversight and push for change so that all employees may benefit from the safe and respectful workplaces they deserve.
"Economic Gains From Women's Equality in Nordic Countries  Womens equality is not just a moral good, it makes economic sense."
Swedish Ambassador Karin Olofsdotter attributed 20 percent of Swedens GDP growth to womens increased labor force participation.
"Research shows that when women have the tools to succeed and there is greater gender equality in societies, those societies are more peaceful and prosperous."
The United States has a long way to go and lots of opportunities for growth on womens equality.
Rest assured that I wont stop fighting until our policies unleash the power of women and girls.
Voices of California's 14th District  Here are some issues constituents raised this week:  628 constituents expressed grave concern for the hostilities between the United States and Iran after the lethal airstrike near the Baghdad airport that killed Major General Qassem Soleimani.
I strongly agree with your concerns and believe this strike constitutes the Trump Administrations biggest and most consequential foreign policy blunder to date and proudly joined my colleagues this week in voting for the War Powers resolution.
45 constituents shared support for the Endangered Species Act.
I am proud to have a long record of support for animal and wildlife conservation and have signed multiple letters to the Administration supporting the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and wildlife conservation programs.
Recent efforts to derail the ESA are part of a greater trend of politically-motivated assault on science and the environment.
You have my word that I will fight against these efforts and work to safeguard our wildlife conservation laws.
25 constituents expressed support for gun violence prevention.
"     News from Representative Bustos                                  Dear Lindsey  This week I spent time with local veterans, my bill to improve health outcomes gained new support and more."
"The organizer of 22 VAs Veterans Art Exhibit, Michael Ragan, shows Congresswoman Bustos his artwork and shares his inspiration for starting the event."
I kicked off my week visiting with local veterans at the Peoria Public Library for 22 VAs Veterans Art Exhibit.
22 VA is a group of veterans committed to bringing awareness to veteran suicide and who encourage veterans to express themselves through art.
I thank them for showing me around the exhibit.
"As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the Department of Veterans Affairs, Ill continue to work to ensure our local veterans have access to the care they need."
I encourage everyone in the Peoria area to take a trip to the library to see the exhibit before the end of the month.
You can see more of the visit here.
"This week, more than 60 organizations called for a hearing on my bipartisan, bicameral Social Determinants Accelerator Act of 2019 in a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee."

" News from Representative Pappas                About Contact Services       Marking One Year Since Taking Office            Ayear after taking my oath of office, I'm as committed as ever to working on behalf of all the constituents of New Hampshire's First District."
"I'm proud of what we've accomplished, like getting our veterans the care theyve earned, fighting for funding to address the opioid crisis, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and working to rebuild our states roads, bridges, and infrastructure."
"And while weve accomplished a lot, I'm always more interested in what is left to do."
Lets keep moving forward.
So I hope youll join me in the year ahead and we work together to keep moving New Hampshire forward.
"PFAS Action Act Passes the House        Congressman Pappas offering his amendment on the House floor     Today the U.S. House of Representatives passed the PFAS Action Act of 2019, a comprehensive piece of legislation that seeks to limit the impacts of PFAS contamination on our communities and our environment."
"Although these chemicals have been linked to cancer, immune disorders, thyroid problems, and other chronic health conditions, there have been few federal protections in place to protect public health."
I represent so many tireless advocates and concerned constituents in New Hampshire who have identified this threat in their communities and raised our collective consciousness about the dangers of PFAS.
I am pleased to have passed a bipartisan amendment to this legislation on their behalf.
"This legislation calls on the EPA to set proactive limits for PFAS discharge, holds polluters accountable, and provides impacted communities with resources to address contamination."
"Granite Staters deserve clean water, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to stop PFAS from getting into the environment and our drinking water."

"Keeping Americans Safe  I am thankful no Americans were killed or wounded in this weeks missile attacks by Iran, and I strongly condemn their aggression against the United States."
We must continue to do everything in our power to protect American lives and prevent any further escalation.
"Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution makes clear, in no uncertain terms, that the power to declare war resides in the Congress of the United States."
"Additionally, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the President to consult with Congress in every possible instance before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities.Congress has not authorized the President to use military force against Iran, and it was not consulted in advance of the President ordering his recent action."
"Because of this and the need for a thoughtful and firm policy toward Iran moving forward, I supported the House Concurrent Resolution and call on the President to consult with Congress on any further application of force."
"The United States must be a leader on the world stage now more than ever, drawing on our values and ability to be a force for peace, democracy, and human rights."
"I urge the Administration to present Congress and the American people with plans that open diplomatic channels and engage key allies; keep our soldiers, citizens, and partners safe; prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and exporting terror across the Middle East; and move us toward de-escalation."
Addressing Veteran Hunger  Thirty-six million Americans receive assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
"More than 1.3 million of those individuals are veterans.Recently, the USDA made the decision to cut benefits, potentially impacting 92,000 people in New Hampshire, including veterans who have served their country."
"It's critical we ensure the USDAs decision to cut benefits does not leave our veterans food insecure, and that is why the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, held a hearing this week reviewing the availability of resources to address veteran hunger."
We have got to make sure that veterans get connected to the help they need even as this administration seeks to pull the rug out from under those who are struggling.
"No veteran should go hungry, and I will continue to work on the Veterans Affairs Committee to fight for the health and well-being of our veterans."

This weekend I had a great time helping kick-off the 2020 FIRST season!
"FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a Manchester, New Hampshire-based organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology."
"Each year, students of all ages from across the country compete in competitions to test their creativity, scientific know-how, and ingenuity."
"This years FIRST Robotics Competition - #InfiniteRecharge -is Star Wars themed and I was pleased to speak to thousands of students in Manchester and across the country to kick off the season, and even got to meet R2D2."
Good luck to all the FIRST teams competing in this year's challenge.

"Protecting You from Forever Chemicals             Cleaning Up Our Communities  Today, the Democratic House passed the H.R."
"535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019, to protect communities from PFAS forever chemicals, which are a serious public health threat in America."
"These chemicals are contaminating the water we drink, the air we breathe and the food we eat, and they are exposing millions of Americans to liver disease, asthma, thyroid dysfunction, multiple forms of cancer, and further health threats."
"In fact, nearly all Americans, including newborn babies, have PFAS in their blood, and up to 110 million people may be drinking tainted water."
That is why the Democratic House is taking action.
"We are cleaning up our communities by designating PFAS as a hazardous substance by the EPA, which is the key barrier to cleaning up military and industrial sites, and working with states to fund and support clean-up and remediation efforts."
"And we are helping stem the tide of further contamination, with tough new testing, reporting and monitoring requirements, strict limits on the introduction of new PFAS chemicals, limits on air emissions and banning unsafe incineration, and strong measures to hold contaminating companies accountable."
We urge Senator McConnell to take up this bipartisan legislation  or else he will have to explain to the American people why he is blocking the Houses action to clean up contaminated communities.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi speaks with reporters as the House prepares to vote on a War Power Resolution limiting President Trumps military actions regarding Iran.
"McConnell Fears The Truth For weeks now, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has been engaged in tactics of delay in presenting transparency, disregard for the American peoples interest for a fair trial and dismissal of the facts."
"Yesterday, Leader McConnell showed his true colors and made his intentions to stonewall a fair trial even clearer by signing on to a resolution that would dismiss the charges of impeachment against the President, ignoring the 70% of Americans that believe the President should allow his top aids to testify."
Leader McConnells tactics are a clear indication of the fear that he and President Trump have regarding the facts of the Presidents violations for which he was impeached.
"The American people have clearly expressed their view that we should have a fair trial with witnesses and documents, with more than 70 percent of the public stating that the President should allow his top aides to testify."
"Clearly, Leader McConnell does not want to present witnesses and documents to Senators and the American people so they can make an independent judgment about the Presidents actions."
"Honoring our Constitution, the House passed two articles of impeachment against the President  abuse of power and obstruction of Congress  to hold the President accountable for asking a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections for his own political and personal gain."
"While the House was able to obtain compelling evidence of impeachable conduct, which is enough for removal, new information has emerged, which includes:   On December 20, new emails showed that 91 minutes after Trumps phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, a top Office of Management and Budget (OMB) aide asked the Department of Defense to hold off on sending military aid to Ukraine."
"On December 29, revelations emerged about OMB Director and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaneys role in the delay of aid, the effort by lawyers at the OMB, the Department of Justice and the White House to justify the delay, and thealarm that the delay caused within the Administration."
"On January 2, newly-unredacted Pentagon emails, which we had subpoenaed and the President had blocked, raised serious concerns by Trump Administration officials about thelegality of the Presidents hold on aid to Ukraine."
"And on January 6, just this week, former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton announced he would comply with a subpoena compelling his testimony."
His lawyers have statedhe has new relevant information.
"I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution toappoint managers andtransmit articles of impeachment to the Senate.Every Senator now faces a choice: to be loyal to the President or the Constitution.No one is above the law, not even the President."
A constituent contacted my office because he was having trouble with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services due to US State Department not receiving his documents.
"After my office submitted an inquiry on his behalf, the State Department was able to resend the approval notice to the US citizenship and Immigration Services."

Several pieces of legislation we wrote were signed into law including raising the smoking and vaping age to 21 nationally and offering 12 weeks of paid parental leave to federal workers.
"Federal funding for Hawaii also increased, and we secured over a half a billion dollars in federal disaster relief funding."
"In addition to continuing our work on issues that are priorities for our state and country, I was also named Chair of the Senate's Committee on the Climate Crisis."
"The committee has been working with experts and community organizations to take meaningful action that will help us combat the economic, national security, and environmental impacts of climate change."
Thank you for staying engaged with our office.
"You can also follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter or visit our website for more information."

"Mahalo,    Brian Schatz  United States Senator             Schatz Legislation Signed Into Law Raising the Smoking and Vaping Age to 21This legislation prohibits the sale of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to anyone under the age of 21."
"Research from the National Academy of Medicine shows that raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products to 21 nationwide would reduce the number of new tobacco users, decrease smoking frequency by 12 percent, and save more than 220,000 lives from deaths related to smoking."
"Providing Paid Parental Leave for Federal Workers This bill provides twomillion federal workers with 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child after birth, adoption, or the initiation of foster care."
"Increasing the Ability for Military Bases to Handle Extreme Weather Senator Schatzs legislation, the Requiring Every American Defense Installation to Nullify Environmental Stresses for Security (READINESS) Act, protects military bases from extreme weather events by requiring them to prepare for potential disasters and other risks posed by severe changes in environmental conditions."
"Improving the Emergency Alert System The Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats (ALERT) Act, which was introduced by Senator Schatz following the false emergency alert that went out across Hawaii in January 2018, will improve the emergency alert system and give the federal government the primary responsibility of alerting the public of a missile threat."
"Fighting Trafficking of Child Pornography The End National Defense (END) Network Abuse Act upgrades the training and technical capacity of military criminal investigative organizations to confront the misuse of the DoDs computers, facilities, and equipment to access and trade child pornography."
"It would also require the DoD to enter into collaborative agreements with appropriate federal, state and local law enforcement entities, child protection organizations, trauma informed health care providers, and targeted social services."
"To read more about it, click here."
"Expanding Benefits for Veterans As a result of legislation authored bySenatorSchatz, which was signed into law in 2018, theDepartmentof Defense (DoD) has expanded access to military commissaries, exchanges, and recreation facilities to more veterans and caregivers."
Thousands of veterans in Hawaii may be eligible for these new benefits.
Veterans and caregivers now eligible to access commissaries and exchanges include:   Purple Heart recipients Former prisoners of war All veterans with service-connected disabilities Individuals approved and designated as the primary family caregivers of eligible veterans under theDepartmentof Veterans Affairs (VA) Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers    Leading on Our Priorities Chairing the Senate Special Committee on the Climate Crisis Senator Schatz was named Chair of the newly established Special Committee on the Climate Crisis.
The committee is responsible for working with experts to issue findings on the economic and national security consequences of climate change.
"The committee held several hearings on issues related to climate this year including disaster resilience, environmental justice, and current mitigation initiatives at the local level."
"They have also solicited input from labor leaders, Indigenous groups, and international banking executives."
"Providing Quality Low-Cost Choices for Health Insurance SenatorSchatzand U.S. Representative Ben Ray Lujn (D-N.M.) reintroduced theState Public Option Actto create a Medicaid-based public health care option to strengthen the Affordable Care Act by providing Americans with a new high-quality, low-cost choice when purchasing health insurance."
"Expanding Care Through Telehealth Senator Schatz led a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) for Health Act of 2019, legislation that would expand telehealth services through Medicare, improve health outcomes, make it easier for patients to connect with their doctors, and help cut costs for patients and providers."
Several provisions in earlier versions of the CONNECT for Health Act have become law or been adopted by federal agencies.
"Leading on Affordable College SenatorSchatzand Representative Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) led a group of 42 members of Congress in reintroducing theDebt-Free College Act, legislation that will reverse the growing student debt crisis in the United States."
The bill restores a path to affordable college by providing states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education and provide students with debt-free college.
"Addressing Disparities in Higher Education SenatorSchatzintroduced the College Equity Act, a bill that would give colleges and universities funding to address disparities in higher education recruitment, admissions, and support."
Studies show that too often higher education outcomes depend on demographics.
"Students of color have lower acceptance, enrollment, and graduation rates, as well as lower post-graduation salaries and higher student loan debt."
Over half of all college students with disabilities do not graduate within eight years.
Less than 60 percent of all Pell Grant recipients complete degree programs within six years.
"Increased Federal Funding forHawaii Hawaii has now been allocated more than a half a billion dollars in federal disaster relief funding to help the state recover from the historic storms in April 2018, Hurricane Lane, and the eruption of Kilauea on Hawaii Island."
"The funding includes:   $15.3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) inindividual assistance to help people who have lost their home; $205 million from FEMA in public assistance to help local and state governments clean up and repair public infrastructure such as facilities, parks, and water lines; $93.1 million from the Department of Transportation to help rebuild roads and highways; $80 million from the Department of the Interior to help repair damages at the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory and the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge; $71 million from the Department of Housing  Urban Development for housing and community development; $47.2 million from the Small Business Administration in subsidized loans to help individuals and businesses pay for repairs not covered by insurance; $4 million from the Department of Labor in Disaster UnemploymentInsurance to help those who lost their job temporarily or permanently because of a disaster and are not eligible for regular unemployment benefits; and $187,000 from the Economic Development Administration to provide technical assistance."

"Constituent Spotlight In 2019, my office helped recover more than $3 million for constituents owed money by the federal government."
"In 2012, we were contacted by a woman in Clark County who was helping her father obtain back pay he was owed from a VA pension."
"At one point, the funds were even deposited in the account before being removed."
"After seven years of fighting, we helped the constituent obtain nearly $10,000 she was owed last summer."
"Though her father passed away before receiving the benefit, his daughter reported the funds will be used placed into a college fund for her neice."
My Statement on the Death of Qasem Soleimani Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist mastermind who was responsible for the murder of hundreds of Americans.
"Under his command, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps brought death and destruction across the Middle East  and beyond."
"Last week, justice was delivered."
"The Presidents maximum pressure campaign against Iran has always been about pushing Irans leaders, primarily through economic means, to change their behavior and stop exporting terror around the globe."
"Iran failed to change, and mass murderer Soleimani met his fate."
I hope this strike will finally wake up the Ayatollah and the outlaw regime in Tehran.
End the terror and focus on improving the lives of the Iranian people by embracing peace.
"As the Administration considers next steps from here, Congress must be involved in that debate."
"UPDATE: Aquabountys Salmon Farm in Albany AquaBounty in Albany, Indiana, received the first batch of genetically engineered salmon eggs this summer and have now progressed from the hatchery to nursery tanks."
"One step closer to consumption, this Indiana company will provide healthier food options for Hoosiers, create jobs, and spark economic activity for our state."
I played anactive role in opposing regulatory hurdles that threaten AquaBountys production in Indiana by voicing my concern with harmful language previously included in Appropriations bills.
"I will continue to fight for innovation, American free market principles, and Hoosier jobs."

"Hoosiers Need More Federal Justices Indianas federal courts are some of the most overworked in the nation, with the Southern District having the second highest caseload and only five judges to work them."
Many Hoosiers have to wait years before receiving justice.
Adding just two federal judges would help spread the workload so that Hoosiers can receive justice in a timely manner.
"Learn more about my efforts to add these much needed judges here: Sen. Todd Young wants to add federal judges in Indiana, but 2020 election is a hang-up."

President Trump in the Middle East President Trumps decisive actions in the Middle East sent a clear message to the world that the United States will not let attacks against our country go unpunished.
"The strikes led to the death of Qassem Soleimani, the known terrorist leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force."
Soleimani was responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans and thousands of people across the world.
His reign of terror is now over.
We will continue to work with President Trump to ensure our military has the tools to root out terrorism both at home and abroad.
"Meeting at Tyndall Air Force BaseThis week, I was honored to meet with Colonel Travis Leighton and Colonel Brian Laidlaw at Tyndall Air Force Base."

"At both stops, Jim answered a wide variety of questions from residents and clearly and honestly expressed his positions opposing impeachment and the Green New Deal, and supporting USMCA and expanded trade, securing Americas borders, and U.S. energy independence."
Both town hall meetings can be viewed in full on Rep. Hagedorns Facebook page.

"Setting the Record Straight  Jim submitted a statement for the record on the House Floor ahead of his ""no"" vote on the impeachment articles against President Trump."
"Hagedorn wrote, Even the highest-ranking member of this body publicly stated that this process has been two and a half years in the making."
"The Speaker admitted this just months after she told the American people that impeachment would need to be compelling, overwhelming and bipartisan."
"Yet, the only thing bipartisan about this impeachment is the opposition to it."
Jims full statement can be read here.
"December 18, 2019    8."
#USMCAfinally  Jim delivered a speech on the House Floor lauding the long-awaited passage of the USMCA by the House of Representatives.
"USMCA is a win for farmers, businesses, workers and families in the First District and throughout the nation."
"It will open new markets, expand economic opportunity and create high-wage jobs, build momentum for trade deals with China and other nations, and help sustain our rural way of life in southern Minnesota."

"5146, the Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019, was signed into law by President Trump as an amendment included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA) on December 20."
The bill works to remove barriers to entry for small businesses looking to compete for federal prime contracts by requiring contract officers to consider relevant past performance and subcontractor experience of these companies.

"ICYMI: UNLIKE PELOSI, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE A BIPARTISAN CURE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS In case you missed it, I recently wrote an article with fellow members of the Doctors Caucus about our bipartisan plan to lower prescription drug costs for patients."
Click here to read more in the Washington Examiner.
"Unlike Pelosi, House Republicans have a bipartisan cure for prescription drug costs As physicians and healthcare providers, and now policymakers, we believe that innovation will drive the cost of healthcare down more than any new law or policy."
"Whether here in Congress or in our office as a physician, we strive to keep patients out of the hospital and at home and healthy with their loved ones."
Having the best tools and medicine in our toolkit helps us achieve that mission.
"Patients deserve access to cutting-edge medicine that is going to treat, and maybe even cure, Alzheimers or diabetes."
"We need to make sure the next miracle drug sitting in the approval pipeline that could cure childhood cancers, as well as metastatic breast, lung, skin, prostate, or pancreatic cancers, are more quickly available for your loved ones."
Lives literally depend on it.
"While we were in medical, pharmacy and dental school, there were simply no cures or good treatment options for most cancers, leukemia, hepatitis, depression, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
"Within the last decade, weve seen groundbreaking medical miracles."
"One notable example is former President Jimmy Carter, who had widespread metastatic melanoma and was treated by a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug."
"Thanks to American research and ingenuity, we have medicine unlike the world has ever seen, such as CAR T-cell therapy."
Two therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration within the last two years to defeat lymphoma and acute pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia.
"More recently, the FDA approved a miracle drug for cystic fibrosis, which affects 30,000 Americans."
"And, finally, its worth mentioning that just six years ago, Hepatitis C was a death sentence."
"Thanks to investments in innovation, 3.5 million people with Hepatitis C can now take a pill once a week for 12 weeks and be completely cured."
None of these treatments would have been made available if it werent for the United States protecting innovation and encouraging innovators to be pioneers.
"Last year, national healthcare spending reached $3.6 trillion."
"About one-third of all healthcare spending is tied to hospital care, while prescription drugs make up 9%."
About 28% of the federal budget is now being spent directly on healthcare.
"If we are ever going to balance the federal budget, we must get the cost of healthcare under control."
Protecting and streamlining the next miracle drugs is an obvious way to help do that.
We cannot even begin to guess what the savings to Medicare costs would be if we had the cure for Alzheimers and dementia and other illnesses where Medicare is the single largest payer.
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently introduced, and the House passed, H.R."
"3, a government price-fixing bill that would absolutely decimate private research and development for potential future miracle drugs to come to market."
"As with any other industry, the federal government takeover of medicine will halt innovation and lower quality."
"While it may seem popular today to demonize Western medicine, America is still the gold standard and global leader in cutting-edge medicine."
"Of note, of the 270 drugs that have come to the world market since 2011, 100% are available to patients in America, compared to 8% in China, 41% in Australia, 52% in Canada, and 67% in Germany."
"With that said, as policymakers, we recognize the need to balance innovation while appropriately addressing shortcomings in our system."
Were addressing these failures head-on.
"19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act."
"The provisions in this legislation are bipartisan and will lower out-of-pocket patient spending, protect access to new medicines and cures, strengthen transparency, and champion competition."
"We want to promote innovation, which requires government getting out of the way  not more government red tape."
"19 will make the process for FDA drug approval far more streamlined and, among other things, promote generic competition."
"Finally, for the first time ever, this bill provides seniors and Medicare recipients a cap on out-of-pocket drug spending, which allows them to budget their out-of-pocket expenses annually."
We want to reiterate that every single provision in this legislative alternative is bipartisan.
19 could actually become law.
"We truly can lower drug costs for consumers without destroying innovation, unlike with H.R."
"Thanks to the Trump administrations leadership, people now have twice the number of generic drugs approved per year in comparison to the previous administration, and the actual costs of prescriptions have gone down slightly for the first time in modern medical history."
This is just the beginning.
Republicans are ready to do more to work together with Democrats to lower prescription drug prices without killing ingenuity with government control.
"As physicians and healthcare providers, we will continue to advocate for incentivizing good health and prevention."
Lets get to work and deliver meaningful solutions to all.

"Fighting For The People             Over 400 Bills And Counting Our Democratic Majority in the House of Representatives has been hard at work this past year to deliver on our For The People agenda: lowering health care costs by reducing the price of prescription drugs, increasing paychecks by building the green and resilient infrastructure of the future, and cleaning up corruption in government."
"So far, we have passed and sent to the Senate more than 400 bills, of which 275 are bipartisan."
Here is a look back at just some of the incredible legislation that we passed in the House in 2019:   H.R.
"1  For The People Act, to restore confidence in our democracy; H.R."
"3  Lower Drug Costs Now Act, sweeping legislation to dramatically reduce drug prices by giving Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies; making lower drug prices negotiated by Medicare available to Americans with private insurance, not just Medicare beneficiaries; and stopping drug companies from ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the same drugs; H.R."
"4  Voting Rights Advancement Act, to finally restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act after the disastrous 2013 Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court decision; H.R."
"5  Equality Act, to finally and fully end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans; H.R."

"987  Protecting People With Pre-Existing Conditions/Lowering Drug Costs, to strengthen protections for pre-existing conditions, end ACA sabotage, and bring down drug costs; H.R."
"1585  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, a strong improvement and long-term reauthorization of VAWA; H.R."
"1644  Save the Internet Act, to protect the free and open internet for all; H.R."

"4617  Stopping Harmful Interference In Elections For A Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, which focuses on preventing foreign interference in our elections, including requiring campaigns to notify the FBI if a foreign power seeks to provide campaign assistance."
"5068  Farm Workforce Modernization Act, to honor workers dignity and support the farm economy; and H.R."
"5430  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, which, thanks to Democrats changes, now has the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any U.S. trade agreement, as well as critical victories for workers, lower prescription drug costs and environmental protections."
"We continue to call on Senator McConnell, the Grim Reaper, to take up our legislation For The People, so that we can deliver results for families and seniors across America!"
"Happy Holidays The holiday season offers a special opportunity to reflect on the miraculous blessings of family, community and Country."

Wishing You Happy Holidays  Happyholidays to you and yours!
Robba and I hope that you are able to spend quality time with loved ones during this joyous season.

"As we gather with loved ones to celebrate this season, we are also thinking of the many men and women in uniform at home and abroad who are unable to be with friends and family as they fight to protect our homeland."
"Missing the holidays represents one of the many sacrifices our servicemembers and their families make, and I am grateful for their dedicated service to their fellow Americans."
"Safeguarding our FreedomsOn Tuesday, the SenatepassedtheNational Defense Authorization Act(NDAA), which is critical to safeguarding our freedoms and supporting our servicemembers and their families."
This legislation further modernizes our military and includes the largest pay raise for our troops in nearly a decade.
I applaud my colleagues for working to create a bipartisan bill that we can send to the Presidents desk.
I was particularly pleased to see several of my priorities included in the final legislation.
"This includes the Cyber Red Team Assessment to increase security against new and emerging cyber threats, which will help support missions related to the 177th Information Aggressor Squadron of the Kansas Air National Guard Unit stationed at McConnell Air Force Base."
"In addition, the NDAA includes my bill,the Global Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing Act,to strengthen Kansas manufacturers, specifically within aerospace, defense, technology and agriculture."
"Im also pleased that this bill will secure a Military-Type Certification for the Textron AT-6 Light Attack Aircraft, which will have a significant impact on the Kansas aerospace community."
"To read more about my priorities included in this legislation, please click here."
"Funding our Government Passing the CJS Appropriations Package  On Thursday, the Senate passed myFY2020 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriationsbill."
"As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee who authored this legislation, this fiscally responsible bill includes essential resources to further our nations priorities in scientific innovation, law enforcement and economic development."
"This legislation will not only benefit Kansans with federal programs aimed to keep communities safe and invest in infrastructure, but it also accelerates the goal of returning American astronauts to the moon and cementing our countrys leadership in space exploration."
This legislation also strengthens trade enforcement and invests in advancing severe weather forecasting.
"I am grateful to have worked closely with Ranking Member Shaheen to pass a good government, bipartisan bill that enables numerous agencies within our jurisdiction to accomplish their missions and address the needs of our nation."
I look forward to President Trump signing this legislation into law and seeing the ways in which these federal resources impact communities in Kansas and across the country.
"NIH Appropriations Increase Throughout my time in Congress, I have been an advocate for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its mission to save lives, invest in the next generation of Americans and help to establish the United States as a world leader in health research and innovation."
"This week Congressprovided additional resourcesthat will serve to assist our nations top minds and researchers in new discoveries, including treatments and cures for diseases."
"In addition, deadly and devastating diseases result in large financial pressure on families and our healthcare system."
"NIHs research serves to find new treatments and therefore reduces costs, serving to benefit all Americans."
Appropriations Increase for International Food Aid Within the FY2020 Appropriations package thatpassedlast week were increases to international food aid resources.
"As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I work to prioritize funding for our international food aid programs and I was pleased to see that both the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program and the Food for Peace Title II Grants received increases in funding to further their missions and assist in reducing global food security, and benefits Kansas farmers in moving commodities, such as grain."
This is an issue in which the morally correct thing to do is also whats in the best interest of our country.
"By continuing to invest in Food for Peace, McGovern-Dole, and other international food aid programs, food grown by U.S. and Kansas farmers will save lives around the world and reduce conflict by promoting greater social and economic stability."
"Promoting Advancement in Technical Aviation Training  Recently, I introducedThe Promoting Aviation Regulations for Technical Training (PARTT) 147 Act of 2019."
This legislation would establish performance-based regulations to ensure aviation maintenance education institutions have the flexibility to teach core curriculum reflective of the ongoing technical advances and innovation happening across the aviation and aerospace industry.
"Updated 50 years ago, these regulations are no longer reflective of the modernized industry, and updated curriculum requirements are critical in ensuring our future workforce of highly-skilled aviation maintenance technicians."
"Providing Better Care for Our Veterans On Wednesday, IintroducedtheCompetitive Pay for Leaders in Veterans Health Care Actto make certain we have the highest quality workforce at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) delivering the best possible care to our veterans."
"Nine years ago, we passed a law to help VA recruit and retain the best and brightest leaders to manage the many different specialty care functions that VA provides."
This bill will make certain that VA retains the ability to provide competitive pay to attract and keep highly specialized and highly competent leaders serving our veterans in the nations largest integrated healthcare system.
"Without this change, VA would need to collect the higher payment amount back from current and past employees and would face significant challenges hiring qualified healthcare providers."
Honoring Kansans at Arlington National Cemetery This Tuesday I attended the funeral of Colonel (Ret.)
Clyde and Sadie Tate at Arlington National Cemetery.
"Clyde and Sadie were the parents of one of my law school classmates, Butch, who went on to serve as the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army before retiring in 2013."
"Clyde had a distinguished career in the United States Army, enlisting in 1948 and rising to the rank of Sergeant First Class before commissioning as a second lieutenant in 1953."
"Throughout his career, Clyde served two combat tours in Vietnam, once deploying from Fort Riley, Kansas."
"His final posting allowed him to serve as the Director of the Department of Tactics at the Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a school that his son would eventually graduate."
"Throughout Clydes military career, Sadie made certain the family was happy and healthy after braving 37 moves."
"Attending Clydes funeral and catching up with Butch was a somber occasion, but one that filled me with gratitude."
"The funeral was just days after Wreaths Across America took place, an event in which thousands of patriotic Americans across the country place wreaths on the gravestones of our fallen service members in national cemeteries, including the 400,000 in Arlington alone."
Walking through Arlington National Cemetery and seeing every memorial stone adorned with a carefully-placed wreath highlighted the impact of these veterans sacrifices and the debt we owe them for their service.
"As we look forward to Christmas, I ask you to keep the men and women serving in uniform in your prayers during this holiday season."
"Judicial Nominations Reach Record Numbers  At of the end of this week, the Senate confirmed the 187th Article III judge appointed by President Donald Trump."
"This includes the appointments of Judges Holly Teeter and John Broomes to the court for the District of Kansas, 50 circuit court judges, 133 district court judges and two international trade court judges."
"Working together, President Trump and the Senate sat more appellate court judges than any president in history."
There is still work to be done with another 84 total judicial vacancies in the US and I will continue to work with my colleagues to fill these seats and ensure timely court access for all Americans.
"Confirming Kansan Michael Graham On Thursday, the U.S. Senate confirmed Michael Graham to serve as a Member of the National Transportation Safety Board."
"A Wichita native, Mr. Graham currently serves as the Director of Flight Operations Safety, Security, and Standardization at Textron Aviation, where he has worked since 1997."
"Prior to his work in the aviation industry, he spent nine years as a Naval Aviator flying A-7s and F/A 18s as well as being an F/A-18 Aircrew instructor for Boeing/McDonnell Douglas."
"With a long and decorated career of service and safety, both in the military and as a civilian, Mr. Graham is well suited to be a member of the National Transportation Safety Board and I am proud to call him a Kansan."
I appreciate his willingness to continue to serve our country and look forward to continuing to work together here in Washington.
"To watch my introduction of Mr. Graham to the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year, please clickhere."
"Paying My Respects to Ben Bennett On Friday morning, I attended the funeral service for a longtime public servant and friend, Ben Bennett."
"Ben began serving the community of Junction City in 1965 when he accepted a position as a high school government teacher and head wrestling coach, quickly establishing himself across the country for his positive impact on student-athletes."
"After his teaching and coaching career, Ben continued his public service as the Geary County Commissioner for over a decade."
"From my first days as a Congressman, I was lucky to know Ben and his desire to give back to his community."
"He served those around him loyally, and truly embodied the Kansan way of life."
Bens impact on the community will be remembered by many..
"Visiting Mitchell CountyAlso on Friday, I was in Mitchell County for a Kansas Listening Tour Stop in Beloit."

"                             This week, Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Marco Rubio, David Perdue, Johnny Isakson, Richard Shelby and Doug Jones to pass a resolution honoring the victims of the tragic shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola on December 6th, 2019."
Senator Scott also honored the victims in a speech on the Senate floor.
Watch Senator Scotts speech and read his full remarks as prepared for delivery below.
"Today, we come together to honor the courage of our brave men and women in uniform  our heroes  and to remember the victims of the tragic terrorist attack that took place at Naval Air Station Pensacola on the morning of Friday, December 6th."
"Id like to thank my colleagues, Senators Rubio, Perdue, Isakson, Shelby, and Jones for standing with me today as we honor the sacrifice and memory of the 3 victims and their families: Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, known to friends and family as Mo, just 19-years-old from St. Petersburg, Florida, a great athlete who loved to make others laugh."
"Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson of Enterprise, Alabama, a 23-year-old natural born leader and selfless volunteer who lifted others up."
Joshua died a hero after giving first responders information on the shooters location while he was mortally wounded.
"And Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters of Richmond Hill, Georgia, just 21-years-old with a contagious smile whose dream was to serve his country."
"Our sailors and law enforcement officials showed heroism and bravery in the face of evil as they ran towards the shooter that day, saving lives."
"And our first responders, who came to the swift aid of those in need: thank you."
"Today, the State of Florida stands united around the community of Pensacola and the families of the victims as we pray for healing."
And I join my colleagues as we do everything we can to prevent future terrorist attacks.
"Sen. Rick Scott Commemorates 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and Luxembourg    Over the weekend,Senator Rick Scott joined a bipartisan Senate delegation to Belgium and Luxembourg to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge."
"On Monday, the Senators joined members of the House of Representatives at an official ceremony at the Mardasson Memorial near Bastogne, Belgium to mark the occasion."
"Senator Scott also joined his colleagues in introducing a resolution honoring the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, which passed the Senate last week."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Seventy-five years ago, American soldiers  including my father  joined our Allies to fight evil and free Europe from the yoke of tyranny.It was an honor to join my colleagues in Belgium and Luxembourg tohonor the sacrifices made by so many freedom-loving people in support of this cause.We will never forget their sacrifice, and the United States will always stand up for freedom and democracy."

"Sen. Rick Scott: Military Officers Should Be Allowed to Carry Firearms on U.S. Military Bases  In the wake of the tragic terrorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola, andcalls from Navy pilotsto change current policy, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement."
"Senator Rick Scott said, It defies logic that our men and women in uniform, who we train to operate multi-million dollar pieces of military equipment and trust to keep our country safe, are not allowed to carry firearms on U.S. military bases."
Its time for this policy to change.
The terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola shows that its more important than ever for our men and women in uniform to be in a position to defend themselves.
I will work with the leadership of the Armed Services Committees and the Department of Defense to see what needs to be done to change this policy and allow military officers to carry firearms on U.S. military bases.Read more HERE.

"Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Final Passage of National Defense Authorization  Senator Rick Scott applauded the Senates final passage of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes:   Nearly $750 billion in defense spending; A 3.1% pay raise for military members; Senator Scotts amendment to cut off funds to the Maduro regime; Senator Scotts amendment to hold China accountable; More than $1.5 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael; and A ban on the purchase or use of foreign-made drones by the Department of Defense."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Im glad Congress made our men and women in uniform a priority by finally passing the NDAA, which includes nearly $750 billion to fund our military and gives them the resources they need to defend our nation."
"I fought to include more than $1.5 billion in funding to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base and a pay raise for military members, as well as my proposals to hold China accountable and prohibit the DOD from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduroregime."
"Im incredibly proud these priorities were included in the final NDAA, and I will always do everything I can to support our military and its mission to protect our nation, support our allies and stand up for freedom across the globe."
Sen. Rick Scott: Government Misfires in Funding the Arts  Senator Rick Scott released an episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money.
See previous Washington Waste Wednesday features HERE.
This week's episode focuses on what happens when Washington gets involved in the arts  waste and misuse of taxpayer dollars.
"We all can support research and appreciate the arts, but the federal government spends $300 million a year on arts and humanities, including funding expensive projects that dont provide any return on investment for taxpayers."
"For example, this years spending bills include $25 million for the operation, maintenance and security of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and a $7.25 million increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest increase in a decade."
"These spending increases might be nice to have, but with $23 trillion in national debt, Congress needs to make some tough choices."

Senator Rick Scott Applauds Moffitt Cancer Center for Taking Decisive Action to End Chinese Influence  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Moffitt Cancer Center announced that several members of its leadership team resigned after connections were discovered with Communist Chinas Thousand Talents Program.
This investigation was the direct result of a letter Senator Scott sent this month to Florida university presidents urging them to protect national security by safeguarding U.S. research from Communist China.
"Senator Rick Scottsaid, I applaud Lee Moffitt and the board of directors of Floridas H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute for their proactive leadership in taking swift and decisive action against these individuals, who had an improper and undisclosed relationship with the Communist Chinese government."
"According to the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee, the Thousand Talents Program incentivizes individuals engaged in research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and research they gain here to China in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives."
We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China and its attempts to steal U.S. research and intellectual property.
"We have to remain vigilant and proactive, and I will to continue to work with universities, hospitals and businesses to make sure they are protected.Read more HERE."
Senator Rick Scott Response to House Impeachment  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the House vote on impeachment.
"Senator Rick Scott said, The House Democrats just spent a month confirming that the President did nothing wrong and that this impeachment circus is nothing but partisan politics."
This vote solidifies how little the Democrats care about whats really important to the American people.
Its clear all they care about are political games.
"This is sad and embarrassing, but I came to Washington to get something done for the American people."
"I look forward to getting back to working on all the things that arent getting done, like passing No Budget, No Pay, securing the border, and lowering drug prices for American families.Read more HERE."

"Sen. Rick Scott: Merry Christmas, Heres How Congress is About to Waste Your Money  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for National Review about the $1.4 trillion, 2,313 page-long spending package that Congress voted on this week."
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, This week, Congress is set to vote on a giant spending package  2,313 pages long  that was just released, was negotiated in secret, spends $1.4 trillion, and is chock full of member projects and special-interest giveaways."
"To put that number in context: Without any opportunity to read the bill, Congress will vote to spend more than $4,200 for every man, woman, and child in America."
"Thats on top of the $23 trillion in debt weve already accumulated, not to mention that the federal government is already running a trillion-dollar deficit, every year."
"This bill spends $1.4 trillion, with no cuts or reforms."
This is not how Washington is supposed to work.
"But one simple idea that we can get done right now is No Budget, No Pay."
"If Congress cant pass a budget and appropriations bills in a timely and orderly fashion, members of Congress shouldnt get a paycheck."
You dont get paid if you dont do your job.
Its time to stop the madness.
How many more trillions of dollars do we need to spend before we wake up to the danger of our national debt?
"We need to reform the way Washington works, and we need to do it now."

"CAMACOL hosted its 34th annual Holiday Basket Distribution food drive in Little Havana this week, serving holiday meals to nearly 3,000 families in South Florida."
Thanks for all that you do!
"This week, more than three dozen children found their forever homes during the 15th annual Home for the Holidays event at theDuval County Courthouse in conjunction with Family Support Services of North Florida."
"                          NEWSROOM  18TH DISTRICT               December 20, 2019              Weekly Report From Your Congresswoman    It was a historic and somber week in Congress, with the House adopting two Articles of Impeachment against the President, only the third time in our nations history to do so."
This will be my last E-Newsletter of the year because the House has adjourned for the remainder of the year.
Ive also included accomplishments in 2019.
"Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week    Voted YES on two Articles of Impeachment  On Wednesday, the House passed two Articles of Impeachmentagainst the President."
The first Article accuses the President of abusing his power by withholding congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into his political rival.
"In doing so, the President undermined our national security and the integrity of our elections to support his own political interests."
The second Article accuses the President of unprecedented obstruction of Congress by defying subpoenas and directing agencies not to cooperate with the investigation.
"As I cast my vote for the Articles, I was guided by my oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic."
"The Constitution is the soul of our nation, and by defending it, we are saying we will not be soulless."
"To review a timeline of the impeachment inquiry and related documents, visit my website."
"Voted YES on the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act    The 2017 Republican Tax Bill took a sledgehammer to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction by limiting it to $10,000 annually for both individuals and married couples beginning in tax year 2018."
"Prior to this harmful cap, 194,160 of my constituents claimed an average SALT deduction of $63,083 in 2017."
"More than half of all taxpayers in our District claimed this credit, and half of these taxpayers earned between $75,000 and $100,000 annually."
Ive consistently stated that capping the SALT deduction represents an assault on the middle class which is why I cosponsored and voted for the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act to eliminate the marriage penalty this year and the SALT deduction cap altogether in 2020 and 2021.
The measure passed the House by a vote of 218 to 206.
Voted YES on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act  The House passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act after months of tough negotiating.
"Democrats secured critical changes to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for American workers, delivering an agreement that is stronger than the first draft of USMCA that the Trump Administration put forward."
"The USMCA now has the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any U.S. trade agreement, as well as critical victories for workers, lower prescription drug costs, and environmental protections."
Voted on Spending Bills  This week the House considered two spending bills to provide funding for the federal government for 2020.
"I voted Yes on the first spending bill, which increases funding for important investments in public health, housing, education, child care, clean energy, infrastructure, and foreign aid."
"Importantly, the legislation includes $25 million split between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to study the public health impacts of gun violence, the first time such funding has been provided in more than 20 years!"
I voted No on the second spending bill because it failed to significantly reduce funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and hold them accountable for their inhumane treatment of migrants at the border.
The legislation also fails to limit the Trump Administrations ability to transfer funding from other accounts to pay for his misguided wall on the southern border.
"While there were other good provisions in this bill, I could not in good conscience vote for legislation that does not hold the Trump Administration accountable for cruel immigration policies."
Legislative Accomplishments of 2019  The first year of the new Democratic Majority has been highly productive.
"The House passed over 450 bills, with 330 of them being bipartisan."
"We tackled the important issues to strengthen health care, implement background checks for firearms, protect our environment, and secure election security and voter rights."
Below are some highlights of the 452 bills I sponsored and cosponsored this year.
"Passage of 31 Bipartisan Bills by the Health Subcommittee which I Chair    On January 15, 2019, the Democratic Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee elected me as the first woman ever to serve as Chair of the Health Subcommittee."
"In my first year as Chairwoman, my Subcommittee passed 31 bills to:   Lower drug prices Strengthen the ACA Fund critical public health programs and workforce training programs End surprise billing Address the maternal health crisis End the youth e-cigarette epidemic  Each of the 31 bills passed by my Subcommittee received bipartisan support, either through bipartisan cosponsors or bipartisan votes in the Committee or in the full House."
"My subcommittee also held 19 hearings this year, including hearings to address the broken pharmaceutical supply chainand examine gun violence as a public health issue."
"To review a full list of the hearings and legislation we passed, click here."
"3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act  The House of Representatives passed H.R."
"3, theElijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Actto address the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. For the first time in the history of Medicare, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be able to directly negotiate the price of the most expensive drugs in the country, including insulin."
"The lower prices will not only apply to Medicare beneficiaries, they will apply to everyone who has private insurance."
"Manufacturers will no longer be allowed to hike prices faster than the rate of inflation, and very importantly, it caps the out-of-pocket costs of seniors for their prescription drugs at $2,000 annually."
"Among several significant policies, theLower Drug Costs Now Act:   Lowers drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for all Americansby allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug companies."
The lower prices and cost-sharing will apply to Medicare and ALL private insurance plans.
Stops drug price hikesby requiring manufacturers who raise the price of any drug that is covered by Medicare (including generics) above the rate of inflation to lower the price or pay the entire price above inflation back to the government.
Limits out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugsfor Medicare beneficiaries.
"For the first time in the history of the Medicare Part D program every senior will have their out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000."
"Today, some seniors pay up to $5,100 in out-of-pocket costs and some pay more."
Increases NIH fundingto research and develop new cures.
It provides $2.895 billion for the FDA to ensure the safety of our drugs; invests in our community health centers; and directs $10 billion to address the opioid crisis.
"Adds vision, hearing, and dental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as colonoscopies and lymphedema treatment."
"Passage of a Resolution to Recognize the Armenian Genocide   After fighting for 27 years to end the official U.S. silence regarding the first genocide of the 20th century, I led the effort to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide, and the House passed a resolution to do so on a bipartisan vote."
"Between 1915 and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians, and hundreds of thousands of Assyrians, Greeks, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire."
"There is a historic parallel today as Turkey is once again engaging in ethnic cleansing, this time against the Kurds in Syria."
"The resolution we passed not only honors and commemorates my Armenian and Assyrian ancestors and all those who perished in the first genocide of the 20th century, but it also serves as a timely reminder that we must remain vigilant to prevent similar atrocities today."
100+ years of official U.S. silence ended on October 29th with a bipartisan vote of 405 to 11.
The Senate passed the Resolution last week on December 12th.
"The U.S. has now joined the 49 U.S. states and over 2 dozen countries, including 14 NATO allies, that have passed Armenian Genocide resolutions."
"Introduction of the Online Privacy Act, the Strongest Privacy Bill in Congress  Every American is vulnerable to privacy violations with few tools to defend themselves."
"Too often, our private information online is stolen, abused, used for profit, or grossly mishandled."
"In November, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA-19) joined me to introduce theOnline Privacy Act."
"Our legislation secures individuals privacy, encourages innovation, and restores trust in technology companies."
"It protects our privacy by:   Creating User Rights The bill grants every American the right to access, correct, or delete their data."
"It also creates new rights, like the right to impermanence, which lets users decide how long companies can keep their data."
"Placing Clear Obligations on Companies The bill minimizes the amount of data companies collect, process, disclose, and maintain, and bars companies from using data in discriminatory ways."
"Additionally, companies must receive consent from users in plain, simple language."
Establishing a Digital Privacy Agency (DPA) The bill establishes an independent agency led by a Director thats appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term.
The DPA will enforce privacy protections and investigate abuses.
Strengthening Enforcement The bill empowers state attorneys general to enforce violations of the bill and allows individuals to appoint nonprofits to represent them in private class action lawsuits.
"Our bill received strong endorsements from public interest organizations, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) ranked our bill the strongest of nine privacy bills in Congress."
Passage of the Presidential Tax Transparency Act as a part of H.R.
"1, the For the People Act  The House passed H.R."
"1, the For the People Act, to restore trust in our government."
"The legislation addresses corruption, strengthens our democracy, and returns power to the people of our country."
Im proud to have one of my bills included in H.R.
"1 that requires sitting presidents, vice presidents, and major party nominees for both offices to disclose their 10 most recent federal income tax returns to the public."
Presidents and presidential candidates should be required by law to inform the American people of their finances so we can determine who will best make decisions in the interest of our country.
"Passage of the TRACED Act to End the Scourge of Robocalls  Americans received an unfathomable 48 billion robocalls last year and a near-record 5.5 billion calls in October of this year, but relief is on the way!"
The House and Senate passed the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act.
The bill will bring much needed relief to all of us who are subjected to abusive robocall practices.
This legislation requires that phone carriers implement call authentication technology and offer call blocking services to consumers at no additional charge.
"Importantly, it requires the FCC to enact safeguards so companies cannot abuse robocall exemptions, and ensures the FCC has the authority and the tools to take strong, quick action when it tracks down robocallers."
The bill awaits the Presidents signature.
"Three of My Health Bills Passed the House, Two of Them Were Signed into Law  Pandemic and All-Hazards Advancing Innovation Act  My bipartisan Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA) was signed into law to strengthen and improve U.S. national preparedness and response for public health emergencies, including infectious diseases such as Ebola and measles, natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, and manmade disasters."
The legislation provides essential funding to bolster our defenses against bioterrorism and public health emergencies.
"ACE Kids Act  My bipartisan legislation with Reps. Castor, Bilirakis, and Herrera Beutler, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (ACE Kids Act), was signed into law to improve how care is delivered to Americas children with complex medical conditions on Medicaid."
The legislation allows states to opt into a new Medicaid program which will provide complete wrap-around healthcare services for the nations sickest children.
The ACE Kids Act aims to better coordinate this care while reducing overall Medicaid spending by creating a Medicaid care coordination program.
This legislation is based on existing programs that save money by decreasing hospital visits and improving care.
Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital was a sterling partner in this effort.
Purple Book Continuity Act  The House unanimously passed my bipartisan Purple Book Continuity Act to make drugs more affordable by bringing transparency to the current patent system.
"The legislation implements transparency reforms to the Purple Book, a document created by the Food and Drug Administration, which manufacturers use when considering where to invest their research and development dollars."
"Under my legislation, the Purple Book will be updated more routinely and be made available easily online, informing manufacturers of brand-name biological drug patents that are expiring."
"This will encourage manufacturers to develop alternatives to high cost drugs, adding pricing pressure to the drug market and saving patients money."
Passage of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act  The House passed my bipartisan legislation that increases efficiency of federal data centers.
The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act directs the Executive branch to harness information and communications technologies to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use within the federal government.
"As the nations largest energy user, landowner, and employer, the federal government should lead by example to improve the energy efficiency of its technology equipment and data centers."
"This legislation will reduce the federal governments energy use, save taxpayer dollars, and set the standard for the private sector."
This legislation is still awaiting a vote in the Senate and I look forward to them taking this up in 2020.
Passage of Key Provisions of the TRUE Fees Act  Cable companies pocket an estimated $28 billion a year from the American people by advertising one price to customers and then tacking on confusing charges and hidden fees to their bills.
"Congress passed key provisions from my TRUE Fees Act which requires cable and satellite TV providers to disclose an all-in price to consumers, including fees and taxes, before consumers sign up for a service; requires that consumers receive a formal notice of fees and all-in prices within 24 hours of signing up for a service; and grants consumers 24 hours to cancel after receiving formal notice of fees, without penalty."
Passage of the Save the Internet Act  The House passed theSave the Internet Actto restore bipartisan net neutrality protections for consumers and small businesses.
The legislation reverses the Trump Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) wrong-headed repeal of critical net neutrality protections in late 2017.
"Since the FCCs decision to end net neutrality, control of the Internet has been taken from the American people and handed over to Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, ATT, and Verizon, empowering them to generate new profits by restricting access."
"TheSave the Internet Actis a simple, but powerful three-page bill that wrests control from ISPs and restores the internet as an open platform for content, speech, and information."
The Internet is one of the greatest communication networks in human history and an American invention.
"Its our responsibility to protect it as a force to drive innovation, expand our economy, and promote free speech in our democracy."
Watch my floor speech on theSave the Internet Acthere.
Constituent Outreach  Town Hall Meetings  I held 15 Telephone Town Hall Meetings and six in-person Town Hall Meetings throughout our District to give constituents the opportunity to ask me questions and voice their concerns.
Thousands of constituents participated in to our Tele-Town Hall Meetings and our in-person Town Hall Meetings.
"With each Town Hall Meeting, I'm inspired by the deep sense of patriotism of my constituents, and that together we can keep our country a beacon of hope and freedom."
"Mail  In the first year of the 116th Congress, my office received over 115,000 letters, phone calls, and email from constituents about issues they care about."
"I appreciate the time constituents take to write to me, and I want you to know that I personally read and respond to every letter my constituents send to me."
I never put out group letters or canned mail and I dont plan to.
"I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas."
---------  2019 has been a historic year in Congress.
It has been stressful and it has been productive and theres much work to do in 2020.
"Whether its working to meet the challenges of climate change; ensure Americans have access to affordable health insurance; bring down the cost of prescription drugs; strengthen our privacy rights; protect our environment; or save the free and open Internet, I will continue to be an outspoken champion for my constituents and advance impactful legislation in the second year of the 116th Congress."
"Should you have any questions or comments, let me hear from you."
"I value what my constituents say to me, and I always need your thoughts and benefit from your ideas."
"May the New Year be filled with every blessing for you, your family, and our country."
"Dear Friends, Today, I voted for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)."
"Under the current trade agreement, NAFTA, all agricultural tariffs were phased out to zero except for certain products, which include U.S. imports from Canada of dairy products, peanuts, peanut butter, cotton, and sugar, and Canadian imports from the United States of dairy products, poultry, eggs, and margarine."
"All food and agricultural products that have zero tariffs under NAFTA would remain at zero under USMCA, and market access would be expanded for the additional agricultural products traded between Canada and the United States."
Our trade partnerships with Mexico and Canada are important to the well-being of our economy.
"USMCA is a win for farmers, ranchers, manufactures, and the American economy."
This agreement is good for our markets.
It is important that Americans have open markets to sell goods.
How will this agreement affect you?
"Eliminates the NAFTA loophole that exempts purchases by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) from the Buy American requirements known as the Kissell Amendment, affecting cotton."
TSA will now be required to purchase uniforms made of American-grown cotton.
"In Fiscal Year 2017, TSA purchased approximately $34 million worth of textile and apparel products."
Texas currently exports more than any other state to Mexico and is second in exports to Canada.
This totaled $137 billion worth of products to North American partners in 2018.
"More than 950,000 jobs in Texas are supported by trade with Mexico and Canada including 60,400 jobs supported by exporting agriculture products."
The annual value of Texas agricultural exports to our North American neighbors total more than $7.2 billion.
"Economy-wide models estimate that USMCA will increase Americas GDP by about $68.2 billion and employment by 176,000 full-time jobs."
Wages are expected to increase for workers in all fields by .27 percent or $150 per worker per year.
"U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada would increase by $2.2 billion, when are implemented."

"                                                   Boozman Bulletin:Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge   On December 16, 1944 in the Ardennes Forest of Luxembourg and Belgium, American soldiers were unexpectedly attacked by German forces."
"The Allies were unprepared, outnumbered and facing record-low temperatures with dwindling supplies."
"Still, the men on the frontlines dug in to defend against the enemy at the Battle of the Bulge, a critical engagement of World War II."
"Arkansan Bill Strauss was one of the brave men who faced the bitter cold, with lack of sleep and a shortage of food."
He and his fellow troops endured this extreme test of will and resolve.
I met with Bill this year to help him celebrate his 100th birthday and thank him for his service and continued commitment to sharing his experiences with the community.
"Its been 75 years, but Strauss recollection of the details of the unimaginable circumstances he faced was still very clear."
He talks about his memories in the Battle of the Bulge in order to honor his fellow soldiers who werent so fortunate as well as teach succeeding generations about the realities of war and the remarkable perseverance of American troops.
"The six-week battle demonstrated the commitment, courage and resilience of Bill and all American soldiers."
It was the largest battle ever fought by the U.S. Army.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called it the greatest American battle of the war.
It came at a considerable cost.
"More than 89,000 American soldiers were casualties including 19,000 soldiers killed, 47,500 wounded and 23,000 captured or missing in action."
The people of Belgium and Luxembourg have a close place in their hearts for American soldiers who sacrificed their lives on foreign soil.
They continue to display that gratitude today.
Thanking a Battle of the Bulge veteran for his service at an event recognizing the valor of American troops.
This past weekend I led a group of my fellow senators to both countries to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.I was honored to visit with the American veterans who fought in the battle and were returning to the land theyd defended.
"There are fewer and fewer who are able to join, but that doesnt diminish what they did there or the steadfast way they fought and sacrificed in the name of freedom."
We can be proud of the unwavering bravery of the American troops and the Allied Forces whose efforts defeated the German attack and led to the end of the Nazi regime.
I was honored to support the Senate-passed resolution recognizing the 75th anniversary of this battle and honoring the heroism of the troops who helped secure this victory.
"As we reflect on this occasion, let us protect the legacy of brave individuals like Bill and countless others whose courage and sacrifice secured peace in Europe."
"_______________________________________________________________________  Quick Takes:     Urging Passage of USMCA trade agreement: Modernizing our trade deal with Canada and Mexico will deliver wins for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and businesses in Arkansas and across the nation."
"The Trump Administration and particularly Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, has worked incredibly hard to make this deal possible."
I'm looking forward to reviewing the final details of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and hopefully getting it across the finish line soon.
I highlighted a report produced by the World Trade Center Arkansas to make the case for the passage of this trade agreement.
"Investing in National Security: On Tuesday, the Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)."
This legislation is critical to ensuring service members have the tools and resources they need to protect national security.
I'm pleased provisions for which I advocated are included in the bill.
"It repealsthe Widow's Tax, allows a land transfer that willexpand burial space for veteransat the Arkansas Veterans Cemetery, authorizes additional full-time Air Force Reservists  one of the top priorities for the Air Force Reserve, expands Arlington National Cemetery and broadens Wounded Warriors Adaptive Sports programs."

"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk Important news from this week:* - This week, we celebrated the fourth anniversary of the Every Student Succeeds Act -- bipartisan legislation I introduced that restored to states, including Tennessee, communities and teachers the responsibility for improving student achievement."
"- Amazon purchased two properties in Wilson County, which will bring more jobs to Middle Tennessee."
"- Vanderbilt's Dr. Josh Denny will serve as the new chief executive officer for the *All of Us* Research Program, the centerpiece of the Precision Medicine Initiative at the National Institutes of Health."
Dr. Josh Denny is an experienced team leader and has precisely the skills needed to finish the important job of collecting health information from one million people and using that information in a way that saves lives.
- The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Dr. Stephen Hahn to serve as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
"Now he can get to work approving new life-saving drugs and devices, regulating tobacco and e-cigarettes, addressing the opioid crisis, ensuring pain patients can receive the medications they need and protecting our nation's food supply."
"*Announcing a bipartisan agreement on legislation to lower health care costs for Tennessee families* This week, I announced a bipartisan agreement with health committee leaders in the House of Representatives on legislation to lower what Americans pay [link 1] out of pocket for their health care."
I do not think it is possible to write a bill that has broader agreement than this among Senate and House Democrats and Republicans on Americans' number one financial concern: what they pay out of their own pockets for health care.
"This legislation includes proposals from 80 senators, 46 Democrats and 34 Republicans."
"It would end the practice of surprise billing for patients - this occurs when you go to an emergency room covered by your health insurance, and are surprised several weeks later by an unexpected bill in the mail that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars."
"It will also provide nearly $20 billion for five years of funding for the nation's 1,400 community health centers, including the more than 200 community health centers in Tennessee, and lower the cost of prescription drugs and other medical services by requiring transparency and spurring competition."
Congress should pass the bill promptly and give the American people a very good Christmas present.
"*Permanently funding Historically Black Colleges and Universities and simplifying the federal student aid application form* [image = The United States Senate passed [link 2] on Tuesday the FUTURE Act, which included a bipartisan amendment I sponsored that permanently reauthorizes $255 million in annual funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions and simplifies the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) -- the complex, archaic form that 20 million families, including 8 million minority students and 400,000 Tennessee families, fill out every year to qualify for federal student aid."
This legislation is now headed to the president's desk so it can be signed into law.
It's hard to think of a piece of legislation that would have more of a lasting impact on minority students and their families than this bill.
"First, this legislation provides permanent funding, fully paid for, for HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions attended by over 2 million minority students."
"Second, after five years of bipartisan effort, the legislation takes a first step to simplify the FAFSA which removes a huge roadblock for the millions of Americans who apply for federal grants and loans to attend college."
Former Governor Bill Haslam has called the FAFSA the single biggest impediment to Tennessee students taking advantage of our state's two free years of community college.
This bill is now headed to the president's desk to be signed into law.
"*Celebrating the fourth anniversary of fixing No Child Left Behind* On December 10, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Every Student Succeeds Act [link 3] (ESSA) -- bipartisan legislation I introduced that restored to states, including Tennessee, communities and teachers the responsibility for improving student achievement -- calling it a ""Christmas miracle."""
"This week, I celebrated the fourth anniversary of what the *Wall Street Journal* called ""the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century."""
"Under ESSA, every state plan for spending federal dollars has now been approved by the U.S. Department of Education."
"More than half of states have already improved those plans with amendments based on feedback from superintendents, principals, teachers, parents and students."
Less time is being focused just on test scores.
States have begun to identify their lowest performing schools and provide extra support in order to improve during this school year.
I hope states will continue to take advantage of this new flexibility.
[image = *I enjoyed celebrating ESSA's fourth anniversary this week in a panel discussion with a few of my congressional colleagues.
"* *New trade agreement with Mexico and Canada is ""good news"" for Tennessee auto workers and farmers* Updating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) makes sense, and the agreement announced [link 4] this week will continue to raise family incomes and create even more good-paying jobs, which is good news for Tennessee auto workers and farmers."
"I believe the president's stated goal of ""zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies"" is exactly the right goal for Tennessee's auto industry, manufacturers and farmers, and a welcome movement away from piling tariffs on top of tariffs that threaten to destroy jobs and lower family incomes."
"Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple."
"Tennessee's automotive industry is so important to me because in 1978, when I was running for governor, Tennessee hardly had any auto jobs."
"Now, 136,000 Tennesseans -- one third of our state's manufacturing jobs -- work in the automotive industry at plants and suppliers in 88 of our 95 counties."
One of the reasons Tennessee has been able to have so much success building cars and SUVs is because NAFTA was fundamentally a zero tariff trade agreement.
[image = *It was good meeting with Tennesseans this Tuesday with my colleague and friend Senator Blackburn.
"* *Passing the most important new law for over-the-counter drugs in 40 years* The Senate Tuesday passed the most important new law [link 5] affecting the safety, innovation, and affordability of over-the-counter drugs since the 1970's."
"In 2015, as the Senate health committee I chair was working on the 21st Century Cures Act, I asked Janet Woodcock, the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, if there was any change she needed but hadn't been able to get done."
She replied that the over-the-counter monograph -- the rules that govern how all drugs sold at pharmacies other than prescription drugs are approved -- hadn't been updated since the 1970's and that she hadn't been able to persuade Congress to do it.
Johnny Isakson (R-G.A.)
and Bob Casey's (D-P.A.)
"Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act will now modernize those rules."
"It is a great testament to Senator Isakson's legislative skill and determination, and I thank him and Senator Casey for their work to get this update across the finish line."
*Confirming Dr. Stephen Hahn to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration * The U.S. Senate confirmed Dr. Stephen Hahn [link 6] to serve as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner by a bipartisan vote of 72-18.
"Dr. Hahn's experience as a practicing oncologist, a successful leader of the MD Anderson Cancer Center and work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) make him the right leader for the FDA at this critical time."
"Dr. Hahn can now get to work approving new life-saving drugs and devices, regulating tobacco and e-cigarettes, addressing the opioid crisis, ensuring pain patients can receive the medications they need and protecting our nation's food supply."
"*Health committee approves legislation to help states prevent child abuse and ensure safety and welfare of children* I often suggest Tennesseans look at Washington, D.C., as if it were a split-screen television."
"This week, on one side, you had hearings on impeachment and the Department of Justice's Inspector General report."
"On the other side, Thursday, the Senate health committee approved legislation to help states ensure the safety and welfare of children [link 7] and legislation to fill shortages in the pediatric and geriatric health care workforce."
The bills passed included the CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2019 introduced by Senators Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Doug Jones (D-Ala.) that reauthorizes the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act -- the federal legislation that gives states funding to prevent and respond to child abuse -- and also included the Adoption Opportunities Reauthorization Act of 2019 and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.
"The committee also passed the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act, the Investment in Tomorrow's Pediatric Health Care Workforce Act, the Child Care Protection Improvement Act of 2019, and the NIMHD Research Endowment Revitalization Act of 2019."

"On Friday, Chairman Nadler and the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted 23 YEA and 17 NAY on party lines  to send two articles of impeachment - abuse of power, and obstruction of Congress to the House floor next week."
"Sadly, this comes as no surprise, because Democrats have wanted to impeach President Trump since the day he was elected, more than three years."
"Since then, Democrats have manufactured an endless litany of scandals in the hopes of overturning the results of the 2016 election."
The exchange between President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine did not demonstrate impeachable conduct.
The partisan Articles of Impeachment voted out of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday are very weak and at best utilize an ambiguous standard.
Democrats relentless and obsessive hatred of the President has completely crippled their ability to govern and to deliver bipartisan solutions for the American people.
"Hamilton warned us of this day in the Federalist Papers, he worried as the constitution was written that one-day impeachment would be used as a political tool, in order to overturn the will of the American people."
We cannot allow our political process to start weaponizing impeachment against political opponents.
"Click Video     USMCA  More than a year ago, President Trump signed an agreement with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to revolutionize the way we do business with our top trading partners."
"Tuesday, the United States- Mexico- Canada trade Agreement was ready to be ratified."
The USMCA is a big win for Pennsylvania and the people of Lancaster and York counties.
The USMCA will create new opportunities for Americans in every sector of our economy.
"Our farmers have been hurting for a longtime, especially our dairy farmers, this agreement will open new markets in Canada and Mexico that will help to maintain and expand their sales."
"The USMCA will improve and modernize trade for American Farmers, American Manufactures, and the American workforce in PA-11."
"This week, I had the opportunity to talk with Varney  Co on Fox business, and The Greg Barton radio show about the USMCA and the Presidents visit to Hershey Pennsylvania."
"Click Video    Greg Barton Interview  Click Video     The National Defense Authorization Act  This week the House passed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization act (NDAA) for FY20, it included two of my amendments  The Defense Small Business Advancement Act which permanently reauthorizes the U.S. Department of Defenses Mentor- Protg program with some additional accountability measures, and The Warrior Wellness Act that requires the Department of Defense to submit a report that details the exact shortage of mental health providers at the DOD no later than 180 days after enactment."
"NDAA Highlights  The fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes $738 billion in defense funding, provides a 3.1% military pay-raise, and rejects restrictions on the Presidents authorities to secure our borders."
"This bill also:   Provides the resources to continue to rebuild readiness, advance modernization of the nuclear triad, develop emerging technologies, enhance missile defense, and confront our adversaries."
"Maintains long-standing prohibitions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay, constructing detention facilities in the U.S., and closing Guantanamo."
Provides an additional $5.3 billion in emergency funding for military installations damaged by natural disasters.
Establishes the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the military.
"Provides up to 12 weeks of Paid Parental Leave for the Defense Department, Intelligence Community, and across the federal government, a key administration priority."

"ROBOCALL BILL  On April 3rd, 2019, I joined with my colleagues and introduced a bill to deter robocalls in the U.S. called the TRACED Act, which passed the House with bipartisan support."
Senators John Thune (R-S.D.)
"and Ed Markey (D-Mass) introduced the Senate companion bill (S. 151), which had 22 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the Senate."
"December 5th 2019, the TRACED Act was sent to President Trumps desk and hes expected to sign this important legislation into law, to help cut down on the nuisance of robocalls."
Spam calling has gotten out of hand.
"Day after day, too many Americans receive countless phone calls from suspicious numbers."
"Not only are these calls a nuisance, they are dangerous since wrongdoers can prey on vulnerable people and commit crimes with their information."
"Both sides of the aisle have come together to agree robocalls are endlessly irritating, I urge the President to sign this commonsense measure and help put an end to this frustrating practice once and for all."
For more information on the TRACED Act click here.
"Raw Milk Bill  This week, I joined eighteen members of Congress to introduce a bipartisan bill to allow Interstate Traffic of Raw Milk."
The Interstate Milk Freedom Act (H.R.
5410) prohibits federal interference with the interstate traffic of unpasteurized milk and milk products that are packaged for direct human consumption.
"Its legal to drink raw milk in 50 states, and to sell raw milk in 28 states."
Congress has never passed a ban on raw milk.
"Yet, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did so in capitulation to a lawsuit."
Raw milk is a niche product highly valued by educated consumers who understand any risks associated with its consumption.
"This industry is vital economically for many small family farms in Lancaster and York counties, who survive and thrive by selling directly to the consumer."
"Farmersthroughout Pennsylvanias 11th District and the nation work tirelessly to ensure safe, nutritious dairy products are available to everyone."
Small family farms have been consuming and distributing raw milk safely for hundreds of years.
This bill rightly gets the federal government out of the way and decriminalizes farmers and producers who choose to sell or take unpasteurized milk and other dairy products to willing customers throughout the nation.For more information on The Interstate Milk Freedom Act click here.
"Examining the Education Departments Implementation of Borrower Defense  This week, in the Committee on Education and Labor which I am a member of, we had Secretary DeVos appear before the Committee to discuss the Department of Educations work to address borrowers defense claims that have been filed with the Department."
"Committee Democrats decided instead of using the committee time to have a constructive dialog with the Secretary on the issue, instead they used taxpayers time and money to insult and attack Secretary DeVos and Committee Republicans."
Their comments were unnecessary and offensive.

Hershey With The President  This week I had the opportunity to travel with the President to Hershey Pennsylvania.

"                     HOME ABOUT ME NEWS CONSTITUENT SERVICES ISSUES CONTACT ME          Protecting Voting Rights Last week, I voted in favor of H.R."
"4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which passed the House by a 228-187 vote."
"This legislation would restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act after the U.S. Supreme CourtsShelby County v. Holderdecision in 2013, which greenlighted severe and pervasive voter suppression in several states across the country."
This legislation will ensure that jurisdictions with a proven record of voter discrimination would once again have to pre-clear changes to election laws or voting regulations with the Department of Justice (DOJ) or a panel of federal judges before implementing them.
"I believe it is incumbent upon the federal government to make voting as easy for citizens as possible, not harder."
This bill protects the right for all American voices to be heard.
Addressing Sexual Assault and Harassment in Passenger Transportation Sexual assault and harassment are a problem across our transportation system.
"From airplanes, to public transit, to for hire vehicles, reports of sexual assault and harassment continue to rise."
"Emphasizing that point, just last week, Uber released its first-ever safety report, which detailed 3,000 reports of sexual assaults on U.S. rides in 2018 alone."
"I have been ringing the alarm bell on this issue for several years, and am glad to see growing acceptance of the need to act."
"As Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I have been pressing Uber, and its ridesharing competitor Lyft, to cooperate with the Committee to answer critical safety, labor, and regulatory questions."
"Im glad Uber finally agreed to release this information, as it is incredibly important to the Committees ongoing work to identify much-needed solutions to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment across all modes of transportation, but merely releasing this information will not be enough."
"Taking the first step in tackling the epidemic of sexual assault and harassment in transportation, I introduced H.R."
"5139, the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in Transportation Act."
"As Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I fast tracked this bill, which was recently approved by my Committee unanimously, and I expect it to be considered by the full House of Representatives early next year."
"This legislation would help track and prevent sexual assault and harassment from occurring on board airplanes, buses, passenger vessels, commuter and intercity passenger railroads, and ridesharing vehiclesby requiring companies to establish formal policies, training, and reporting structures regarding sexual assault and harassment."
It also requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to collect information on the number of sexual assault or harassment incidents reported by these entities and make this information publicly available.
"In transportation, the number one priority is safety."
"That means not only getting the traveling public to their destination safely, but also ensuring their safety throughout the trip."
I look forward to this legislation ultimately being signed into law because we need to build a safer transportation system for everyone.
Read my full opening statement at the October 16 hearing on the practices of the ride hailing industry here.
"Stopping Robocalls On December 12, I was pleased to join my colleagues to pass the TRACED Actbipartisan legislation to safeguard Americans from the harassment, fraud, and abuse of robocallsby an overwhelming vote of 417 to 3."
This legislationwould take important steps to stop annoying and abusive robocalls bygranting the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the authority and enforcement tools necessary to rein in robocallers and take quick action when it tracks them down.
"According to a recent report,approximately 48 billion robocalls were placed in the U.S. in 2018, up from 30.5 billion in 2017 (an almost57 percent increase)."
"While some of these calls were made for legitimate reasons  debt collectors, charities, political groups, etc."
"many were not.This flood of calls has resulted in huge profits for robocallers, with every dollar spent by robocallers returning as much as $20 in profit."
Another report predicts that 50 percent of all cellphone calls in 2019 will be from scammers.
"In fact, Americans lost $9.5 billion to scam calls in 2016 alone."
This is absolutely unacceptable.
This legislation has been sent to President Trump for his signature.
"I look forward to this legislation becoming law, and you can be sure I will continue to do all that I can do fight for Americans right to privacy, including curbing unwanted and abusive robocalls."
"SAFER Pipelines Act: Combatting Climate Change, Improving Public Safety, and Holding Operators Accountable On November 20, I passed H.R."
"5120, the SAFER Pipelines Act, out of my committee."
"The bill, which I introduced along with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, holds pipeline operators accountable for reckless actions and addresses climate change by reducing emissions and preventing pipeline leaks."
"For the first time ever, this bill will meaningfully address climate change and safety at the same time."
"There are nearly 3 million miles of pipelines transporting hazardous liquid and natural gas just feet below countless communities across the U.S., yet federal efforts to ensure these pipelines are safe, reliable and environmentally-sound are woefully outdated."
"Moreover, its estimated that this industry is responsible for one-third of our countrys emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the first few decades of its release and a major contributor to climate change."
"This legislation presents a significant opportunity to do better and address the threat of climate change head-on, and I look forward to its full consideration in the House."
Protecting SNAP A new rule finalized by the Trump Administration earlier this month would set stricter requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) to be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Current federal law limits SNAP benefits to three months for ABAWDs unless these recipients work 20 hours a week.
"However, states with high unemployment rates or a demonstrable lack of sufficient jobs can waive the three-month time limit, providing needed support to struggling families and individuals."
"The final rule is scheduled to become effective April 1, 2020."
"The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that 688,000 SNAP recipients will lose benefits  including 19,000 Oregonians."
This rule is the first in a series of Trump regulations that would cut life-saving nutrition assistance from our poorest and most vulnerable.
"This year alone, the Trump administration has proposed rules that would cut benefits for millions of families, including free school lunches for one million kids."
"Time and time again, they display contempt for our nations poor  while doling out handout after handout to millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations."
The truth is that many SNAP recipients are either attempting to find work or face hardships that prevent them from doing so.
"Thats why I am an original cosponsor of the Protect SNAP Act, which would prevent the Secretary of the USDA from implementing this dangerous proposal."
People who are food insecure deserve access to food.
"The administration should work with Congress to promote policies that help the poor, not continue to demonize them."

I am proud to have been selected as a Conferee each year since my first term in Congress to negotiate the legislation with the Senate.
"As the number one advocate for Fort Drum, I worked hard to turn the NDAA into a bipartisan bill that gives our military service members the support they need."
"Our men and women in uniform deserve the maximum amount of resources we can give them to protect our nation and our freedom.This NDAA contains several wins for Fort Drum and the 21st district, including the authorization of appropriated funds for Fort Drum rail head and unmanned aerial vehicle hangar, the requirement of a report on the next steps in securing Fort Drum as the preferred East coast Missile Defense Site, a 3.1% pay raise for servicemembers, substantial military housing reform, addressing climate change and installation resiliency, and the expansion of emerging technologies and higher education opportunities, among many other things."

"Supporting the USMCA Deal    After months and months of tireless work, I am proud to support the negotiated USMCA."
"This trade agreement is a win for North Country farmers and workers, the North Country economy, and America as a whole."
Many hardworking families in my district have been negatively impacted by ineffective trade deals that have outsourced much-needed jobs.
"As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Northern Border Caucus, I have been a leader in pushing for the passage of this long-overdue update which will benefit our workforce and economy for many years to come, and will expand markets for North American-made goods."
"This is a great step forward for the North Country, and I am looking forward to a swift, bipartisan vote in the House to make this agreement official."
"Helping the House Pass the Farm Workforce Modernization Act    This week, I voted to pass the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act, legislation that I was an original cosponsor of.The bill includes solutions to address the labor crisis facing American agriculture.This legislation is not pro-amnesty  agriculture workers enrolled in this new program must have worked a minimum of 16 years in agriculture in the United States before they may apply for legal permanent resident status, not full citizenship."
"Additionally, individuals must pass a background check, and will not be eligible for public benefits, certain tax credits, or Affordable Care Act subsidies.It allows year-round workers, including dairy workers, to gain access to the H-2A program for the first time."
"Additionally, it simplifies the H-2A application process and establishes a mandatory E-Verify program to maintain employment authorization and records for the agricultural workforce.I was proud to help the House pass this bipartisan legislation to ensure our farmers have access to a stable, legal workforce, allowing them to continue to produce abundant, safe, and affordable food."
"North Country farmers have been waiting for agricultural labor reform for years, and this is a major step towards a real solution to the issues facing their workforce."
"We are fortunate to have a wide range of agriculture operations in the North Country that create jobs and drive our economy, and this legislation will maintain their success."
I applaud the House for coming together to pass this important legislation and will continue to advocate for the diverse group of farmers in the North Country.
"Helping Introduce the Lower Costs, More Cures Act  This week, I signed on as an original cosponsor to H.R."
"19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act  the bipartisan policy solution to Speaker Pelosis partisan drug pricing legislation."
"The Lower Costs, More Cures Act is a package of over 40 provisions previously introduced to lower out-of-pocket spending, ensure new medicines and cures are not heavily taxed, strengthen transparency and accountability, and champion competition in the medical community."
"Each provision has bipartisan support.Speaker Pelosis partisan legislation, H.R."
"3, is a 95% tax on lifesaving cures for Americans that has no chance of passing the Senate and becoming law."
"In contrast, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act is a compilation of over 40 truly bipartisan provisions that could be passed by the House, Senate, and signed into law by the President swiftly."
"Im proud to cosponsor this legislation to prioritize more options and lower costs on prescription drugs, promote innovative cures for patients, and reform the drug industry."
"This bill also makes insulin more affordable, increases transparency and removes uncertainty at the pharmacy counter, and stops subsidizing other developed countries' health care through stronger trade agreements."
This legislation would bring real results for my constituents in the North Country who are tired of their prescription drug costs skyrocketing.
"Introducing an Amendment to the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act  This week, I offered an amendment along with Congressman John Katko (NY-24), Congressman Anthony Brindisi (NY-22), and Congressman Joe Morelle (NY-25) to the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act."
This amendment adds harmful algal bloom development research to the list of topics the U.S. Geological Survey can include in the research they are directed to conduct under the Great Lakes Fishery Research title of the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act.
"Unfortunately, Harmful Algal Blooms have been reported across my district  including in Franklin, Washington, and Saratoga Counties."
Offering this amendment to support research into why these blooms are developing and how to eradicate them was critical to preserving the North Countrys diverse ecosystems.
Tackling any issues that arise that threaten our region is one of my top priorities in Congress  I have a clear record of working to conserve and protect our environment.
"This amendment was adopted unanimously into the legislation, which passed on the House Floor this week with bipartisan support.Read more here."
"Cosponsoring Legislation to Support Community Health Centers  This week, I cosponsored the Specialty Treatment to Access and Referrals (STAR) Act."
This legislation establishes a grant program to provide Community Health Centers with the resources they need to build out their telehealth capabilities.
"Telehealth systems allow doctors to communicate with one another to discuss referrals, and for patients to personally interface with doctors online."
Telehealth systems can significantly improve access to specialist care and reduce the need for primary care physicians to conduct such work.
"The proposed funding includes up to $200,000 per health center and up to $5,000,000 for qualifying health networks."
Community health centers are critically important to North Country residents.
This crucial funding would allow groups like Hudson Headwaters and the Adirondack Health Institute to collaborate and expand the scope and types of telehealth services that they can offer the community.
This bill would enable these groups to improve the quality of primary and specialty care services offered to patients in the North Country.
I am proud to cosponsor this legislation and will continue to work diligently to support our community health centers.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:      ___________________  Featured Read:   Officials hope for swift vote on negotiated USMCA  Local, state and federal officials shared their support after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that House Democrats and the White House had reached a deal on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."
"After months and months of tireless work, I am proud to support the negotiated USMCA, North Country Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville) said in a statement."
"This trade agreement is a win for North Country farmers and workers, the North Country economy, and America as a whole."
"Back in October, Stefanik told the Press-Republican that passage of the USMCA  which would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  needed to happen before the end of the year."
"She said the agreement continues NAFTAs zero-tariff treatment, expands access to the Canadian market for U.S. dairy products and includes greater intellectual property protections."
Stefanik and more than 150 other Republican representatives had sent a letter to Pelosi Monday urging her to bring the USMCA to the floor.
"Many hardworking families in my district have been negatively impacted by ineffective trade deals that have outsourced much-needed jobs, Stefanik said Tuesday."
"As co-chair of the bipartisan Northern Border Caucus, I have been a leader in passing this long-overdue update which will benefit our workforce and economy for many years to come, and will expand markets for North American-made goods."
"Today is a great day for the North Country, and I am looking forward to a swift, bipartisan vote in the House to make this agreement official."

Great news: The House just passed the Lower Drug Costs Now Act that will give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescriptions drugs and make the lower prices available to people with private insurance!
Drug companies have been charging Americans more than people in other countries and thats not fair.
"Savings from HR 3 will help improve Medicare with new benefits for vision, hearing and dental care  and save families and employers enormous sums."
"More good news for military families and all federal workers: the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report passed yesterday with a 3.1% pay raise for service members (largest in a decade), improvements to base housing, and a new 12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal employees."
The needs of our military service members and their families are paramount and I am delighted that the Democratic-led House delivered for service members and their families.
"For months, I have worked with families who reside on MacDill Air Base in housing that contains mold and who have pressed for accountability from derelict contractors."
The NDAA establishes a bill of rights for military families and ensures that contractors are held accountable.
"CLIMATE UPDATE On Wednesday, my Select Committee on the Climate Crisis held a hearing on Creating a Climate Resilient America: Smart Finance for Strong Communities to hear from experts on ways that diverse communities across the nation can prepare for disasters, accelerate recovery and increase resiliency."
ENERGY AND COMMERCE UPDATE The Energy and Commerce Committee held two important hearings on health care.
My Subcommittee on Health examined Proposals to Achieve Universal Health Care Coverage.
Florida is one of the last states to expand health services under Medicaid and is leaving over $13 Billion in Washington (through 2024).
"That is crazy and puts our state, our neighbors and our hospitals at a big disadvantage."
"Florida alone accounts for almost ten percent of the nonelderly uninsured in the United States and a new report shows that former Governor Scott and GOP-led Legislatures refusal to expand Medicaid likely resulted in the deaths of as many as 2,800 Floridians."
3- Lower Drug Costs Now Act passed: This bill will finally allow for the negotiation of prescription drug prices through Medicare and stop drug companies from ripping off American families and seniors.
This is an all-American proposition that makes sure everyone can afford the cost of their prescription drugs.
"H.R.729- Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act passed: Congress must pass bold climate legislation, like this legislation, which includes ten separate bills to help coastal communities become more resilient."
"Grants in this bill include the Living Shoreline Grant Program, which will help with designing and implementing climate-resilient living shoreline projects; and applying innovative uses of natural materials and systems to protect coastal communities, habitats, and natural system functions."
"5038- Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 passed: Supported by Florida farmers and agriculture, the bill provides stability for food production by providing undocumented agricultural workers the opportunity to qualify for a new temporary immigration status or permanent legal status."
Impeachment: The Judiciary Committee will report two Articles of Impeachment for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress setting up a historic vote in the House next week.
I recommend the Judiciary Committee Report for your review.
"President Trump abused the power of his office, undermined our national security and jeopardized the next election."

"Visiting the U.S.-Mexico Border This week, I traveled to Rio Rico, Arizona to visit the U.S.-Mexico border for a tour led by U.S. Border Patrol and an Operations and Drug Threat briefing from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)."
"During my visit, I witnessed first-hand the efforts of our law enforcement to interdict drugs and stop crime at our southern border, and the need for more resources to keep our nation safe."
"I have long recognized our immigration system is broken, and I look forward to returning to work in Washington with first-hand knowledge of our border crisis."
Thank you to all the law enforcement officers who work tirelessly to protect our borders.
A special thanks to U.S. Border Patrol Acting Patrol Agent in Charge Agent Kevin Hecht and DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Apolonio Polo Ruiz for hosting me at the Arizona-Mexico border.
"It is Time to Pass USMCA On Tuesday, Ispokeon the Senate floor regarding the importance of passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)."
Canada and Mexico are Kansas top two export markets and this trade agreement would provide certainty for farmers and ranchers while protecting the supply chain for Kansas manufacturers.
"I was able to highlight my time at the Kansas Farm Bureau townhall last week where farmers, ranchers and agriculture leaders expressed the importance of trade and the need to pass USMCA."
"I also noted USMCAs role in protecting the integrated North American supply chain critical to the many manufacturers  aerospace, aviation, automobile, farm equipment and numerous others  that call Kansas home."
"Twenty-five percent of the manufacturers in our state, mostly small- to medium-sized businesses, export to Canada and Mexico."
"USMCA was signed over a year ago, and it is time for the House to pass this important agreement."
"Questioning Panel on Consumer Data PrivacyOn Wednesday, as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Iparticipatedin a hearing with a panel of industry stakeholders and advocates to discuss legislative proposals to protect consumer data privacy."
"We discussed a variety of legislative proposals put forward to address issues related to the privacy and security of consumers personal information.As the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection with jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission, I have held hearings, briefings, and met with multiple subject matter experts and stakeholders in the interest of developing a federal privacy framework that will provide strong protections for consumers nationwide, including bolstering the FTCs existing enforcement authorities and resources.I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on the committee towards enacting a bipartisan federal privacy bill that will offer Kansans and all Americans the privacy assurances they deserve."
"Supporting the Senate Hunger Caucus Food Drive As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I helped host a Senate Holiday Food Drive over the past weeks."
"Senate offices in Washington, D.C. have collected food for needy families, which will be given to the Capital Area Food Bank at the conclusion of the drive this week."
I am thankful for the food my office collected to help hungry families this Christmas season.
Special thanks to my staff member Judd Gardner for his leadership on this year's drive.
"This is the time of year to come together as a community and help those less fortunate than ourselves, and food drives are a great way to help those in need."
"In 2018, its estimated that more than 37 million people in the U.S. were food insecure, including 371 thousand Kansans."
"I appreciate the organizations in Kansas that are helping to end hunger in our state, including Harvesters Food Bank and the Kansas Food Bank, which feeds thousands of families across Kansas."
"Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C."
Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face.

Prescription Drug Prices: Two Paths House Democrats are spending most of their time on the impeachment of President Trump.
"They soon plan to take a break from that activity, however, to push Speaker Pelosis unconstitutional and anti-cures drug pricing bill."
Reducing prescription drug prices should be a priority for the House of Representatives.
"It has been for Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee, including myself."
We have worked repeatedly with the Democrats on the committee on legislation that will help with the unacceptably high costs many people pay for their prescriptions.
"Earlier this year, several bipartisan bills on the issue were advanced out of the committee unanimously."
"Before those bills came to the House floor for a vote, Speaker Pelosi used a backroom maneuver to combine them with highly partisan bills that killed any chance of them becoming law, because the Senate will not pass them."
Her actions constituted a roadblock to progress on an issue important to many Americans.
"Now Speaker Pelosi is at it again with her drug pricing bill, H.R."
"Republicans in the House have repeatedly shown our interest and ability to work with Democrats in tackling this problem, and President Trump has been a strong advocate for action as well."
"But instead of including us in the process and giving the bill a realistic chance of becoming law, it appears Speaker Pelosi wrote H.R."
3 chiefly to please the far left of the House Democrat caucus.
The centerpiece of her bill is the imposition of prices by government bureaucrats.
"Supposedly, the Federal Government will negotiate a maximum drug price."
"In reality, if a drug manufacturer does not comply with the bureaucrats price, the government takes by tax up to 95 percent of the manufacturers gross revenue  in other words, all money made by the sale of those drugs, not just the money made after including the expense of making them."
"That is not negotiation, but coercion."
"Earlier this year, I raised the objection in committee on the record that such a provision would violate the Constitution."
The nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Research Service agree.
"Having analyzed the bill, they warn that H.R."
3 would violate the Fifth Amendments takings clause and Eighth Amendments prohibition of excessive fines.
Speaker Pelosi nevertheless has failed to correct this glaring problem.
The imposition of price controls on drugs will lead to the development of fewer new cures.
"Democrats have accepted that outcome, but I will not."
"Because we are committed to meaningful, practical reform in drug pricing, House Republicans are introducing H.R."
"19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act."
Our bill contains numerous provisions with widespread support that would deliver lower costs without sacrificing new cures.
"For example, it would cap the cost of insulin for seniors in Medicare Part D at $50 a month."
"When insulin can cost patients thousands of dollars today, it is worth remembering that the discoverer of this life-saving product sold the patent for $1 almost a century ago to make sure it was readily available."
"The American Diabetes Association has found that more than 25 percent of Americans aged 65 or older have diabetes, so this protection against high insulin prices will bring real relief."
"The Lower Costs, More Cures Act would give more authority to the Food and Drug Administration to approve more products, increasing competition and creating pressure to lower prices."
"Transparency in drug pricing is a key piece of drug pricing reform, and the Lower Costs, More Cures Act would bring more transparency into the system."
"It would implement changes I have long advocated regarding pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), bringing more of their activities into the sunlight."
The House of Representatives now must consider what it wants out of a drug pricing reform bill.
"3 may excite the far left, but it has no chance of becoming law, nor should it."
"Its provisions, even if they withstand judicial scrutiny, would only prevent or delay the delivery of more innovation in the medical sector."
"In contrast, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act contains a list of policies that would benefit the health and economic well-being of Americans using prescription drugs."
These policies would correct problems without undermining the strengths our health care system does possess.
Most enjoy broad support across the political spectrum and have been introduced as bipartisan bills in the past.
The House should reject H.R.
"3 and take up the Lower Costs, More Cures Act."
"If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office."
"                        The Webster Wire Listening to Floridians Dear Friends:  On Friday, we learned that American employers added 266,000 jobs in the last month."
"Unemployment rate held at 3.5%, the lowest it has been since December 1969!"
A prosperous economy means more opportunities are provided for Floridians and Americans across the nation.
"Since day one, President Trump made it a priority to remove unnecessarily burdensome regulations that were crippling job and wage growth and hurting American small business owners."
These results are proof our economy will prosper when leadership sends the clear message America is open for business and government gets out of the way of hardworking Americans.
"_______________  On Monday, I was pleased to announce Xander Jenkins as the 2019 Congressional App Challenge winner for our district."
"Jenkins, an 11th grader from Citrus County created an app which allows users to take a photo on their phone, upload the photo into the app, and detect any color that is present within the photo."
"As an electrical engineer, I am passionate about computer science and STEM-based education."
These skills are essential as our economy continues to prosper and remains the global leader in innovation.
Xanders app will be featured on the U.S. House and App Challenges websites and is eligible to be displayedin the Capitol Building for one year.
A total of 35 students and 16 teams from schools across District 11 participated in this years challenge.

_______________  The Democrats continued their impeachment obsession as the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing with college professors as witnesses.
"The professors discussed the Founding Fathers view of impeachment, constitutional definitions and past impeachment proceedings."
"Only one of the witnesses was nonpartisan, Professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University."
"Not surprisingly, committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and the majority members of the committee called in three liberal, anti-Trump professors to testify."
"In fact, one of the witnesses  Professor Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School recently stated she reacted so strongly to seeing the Trump Hotel in D.C. she had to cross the street instead of walking in front of it!"
Hardly an unbiased witness.
I was struck by Professor Turleys testimony and comparisons between this process and historical ones.
"He testified that House Democrats were conducting the fastest impeachment"" and that he was ""concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger."""
"He exhorted the committee to slow down, subpoena witnesses who may have direct knowledge of the events in question and use the courts if necessary, to settle disputes between Congress and the Trump administration."
"The next day, the Democrats proved once again this is not about getting the facts, but about overturning the 2016 election results and preventing President Trump from being re-elected."
"Thursday morning, despite still not having received testimony from key witnesses that advanced their narrative or connected the President to their bribery, extortion, or quid pro quo allegations, Speaker Pelosi announced she was directing the House Judiciary Committee to prepare Articles of Impeachment."
"_______________  At every turn, House Democrats are doubling down on their decision to play politics over tackling the issues most important to hardworking Americans.The most recent example, is H.R."
"4, which I voted against last week."
This bill is another attempt by Democrats to give partisan activists the power to undermine the integrity of our election laws for their political benefit.
This bill uses the power of the federal government to overturn voter ID laws and prevents states from ensuring the integrity of their own elections.
"Contrary to their explanations, this bill does not reauthorize the Voting Rights Act nor protect Americans from voter discrimination based on race or gender."
It does not empower states to ensure our election systems are secure against cyber or other attacks.
This is a power grab that would allow federal bureaucracies to manipulate voting rules for partisan political advantages.
Election integrity is a critical component of the American system.
"Instead of promoting election integrity, this bill promotes the interests of Washington politicians and special interest groups."
"_______________  On Wednesday, I attended Holiday Mail for Our Heroes, hosted by the American Red Cross."
"Every Christmas, the Red Cross hosts this opportunity to write several letters to members of our military who will be spending the Christmas season away from their families while they are stationed in Kuwait, Iraq, Poland, Romania, and Djibouti."
Sending our servicemen and women Christmas cards of thanks is a small expression of our gratitude for their service.
We owe them a debt we can never repay.
_______________  Christmas celebrations are in full swing across the district.
On Saturday enjoyed being a part of Lady Lake's annual Christmas Parade.It was great to see so many friends and neighbors out celebrating this holiday season.
_______________ Residents of Ridge Manor!
"Stephen, my Director of Constituent Services, will be at the Community Center of Ridge Manor on Wednesday from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m."
"He will be available to assist constituents with issues involving federal agencies, including, but not limited to:   Department of Veterans Affairs   Social Security Administration   Internal Revenue Service   United States Postal Service   U.S."
Citizenship and Immigration Services Stay Tuned!
"In the coming weeks and months, Stephen will be at more community centers, libraries and neighborhoods across the district."
"Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress   Constituent Corner A constituent was having issues with the VAs online Veteran ID Card application system."
He contacted our office and we submitted the application on his behalf.
"Two weeks after the request was submitted, the veteran had received his Veteran ID card."
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you.
District Update Pam Jones joined the Florida Department of Health at the Lake County Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) meeting.
"They celebrated accomplishments and identified lessons learned for each of their current focus areas: Obesity, Substance Abuse, Access to Food and Nutrition, Access to Primary Care, and Diabetes."
"Legislative Update Last week, I voted against H.Res."
"326, a non-binding resolution regarding the ongoing violent conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East."
This resolution asserts that the U.S. House of Representatives believes a two-state solution is the only viable acceptable solution for this conflict.
"Most troubling, this resolution was a veiled attempt by House Democrats to punish the Trump Administration for reversing the Obama-Era approach to Israeli settlements in the West Bank."
I supported the administrations decision to recognize these Israeli settlements.
I am thankful that the Trump Administration has made clear on the world stage that the United States wholeheartedly supports Israel.
"President Trump has taken great strides in this relationship, including fulfilling a promise made by four preceding presidents - moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, Israels capital."
"Survey By October 1, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security will require a REAL ID compliant drivers license for air travel as part of minimum security standards."

THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING This week was another busy week in Washington.
I'm excited to say our agreement between the House and the Senate to end robocalls was passed by the House this week.
I've been working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee on this legislation to finally end robocalls once and for all.
It is estimated that there were nearly 48 billion robocalls in 2018 nationwide.
This is an increase of more than 64 percent since 2016.
Robocalls are more than just a nuisance.
They can scam consumers and even block hospital phone lines.
The Senate is expected to officially approve the agreement soon.
I look forward to President Trump finally signing this critical legislation into law.
"Also this week, House Democrats continued their impeachment sham."
"Shockingly, Democrats brought liberal professors to Congress to give their opinions."
"However, you can't impeach the President of the United States based on opinions."
"You need facts, and the Democrats do not have a case for impeachment."
Catch up on these issues and more in this week's Buddy's Briefing.
"Click here to watch Buddy's Briefing FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXLI Monday, December 2, 2019: Im in Alma in Bacon County early this morning as I am hosting an H2A roundtable discussion designed to bring local farmers together with federal and state agencies that deal with the program."
The H2A program is a federal program that allows employers to apply for guest workers from other countries to perform seasonal or temporary farm work for a maximum of ten months.
"Representatives from the four main agencies involved in this process, United States Citizens and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Labor (DOL), Homeland Security, and Department of State (DOS), join us at the roundtable via telephone."
Those physically attending the meeting are representatives from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Georgia DOL.

"ATL is the worlds busiest airline hub with over 7,000 airport customer service employees working above-wing, below-wing and in cargo."
"Georgia has been home to Delta for over 75 years and Delta has over 36,000 employees based in the state."
Delta operates 76% of Georgia-based flights and served over 81 million passengers worldwide in 2018.
"Reps. Carter and Bucshon visiting Delta After a great tour, I head back to Washington (via Delta, of course), and head straight to the Senate Chamber at the Capitol where I am present to hear a true Georgia icon, Senior Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA), give his farewell address."

I remain focused on issues that matter most to our community and to providing outstanding constituent services.
Continue reading this brief update to learn more about my work on your behalf last week.
Stopping Robocalls  Robocalls have become more than just a nuisance.
"They are a tool for scammers to prey upon the most vulnerable in our society, the elderly and disabled."
"Illegal robocalls perpetuate fraud, threaten personal privacy, and undermine our telecommunications system."
"Last week, a bill I helped create to fight the plague of robocalls passed the House."
I believe it will go a long way in giving the FCC the tools it needs to prosecute these scammers and shutdown illegal robocall operations.
My hope is that my Senate colleagues will expedite the bill's passage and it will go to the President to become law very soon.
Advocating for our Nations Heroes  The suicide crisis is a multi-faceted national crisis - not a Veteran-specific one - and it is going to take a government and society wide effort to solve it.
"Since only six of the 20 servicemembers and Veterans per day who are taking their lives are receiving healthcare services at VA, we must empower VA to work with community partners to reach those most in need."
"Sadly, during last weeks VA Committee Markup, Chairman Takano missed the opportunity to work in a bipartisan manner with our bill, the IMPROVE Act, which was originally designed as a bipartisan measure to help achieve this important goal."
"While I appreciate the Chairmans intent and know that we have a common goal, by pushing a partisan substitute amendment he has made it much less likely that the IMPROVE Act will garner the bipartisan support it would need to pass the Senate."
This is extremely disappointing and could have negative consequences for our nations heroes.
Clickhere to listen to my comments during the hearing.
"Despite this setback, I remain hopeful that we can work together in the coming weeks to do the right thing for Veterans."
"To learn more about the IMPROVE Act, as originally introduced, click here."
"Additionally, last week my team had the opportunity to visit the construction site of the future VA Outpatient Clinic on Little Road in New Port Richey."
"During the visit, my team was able to talk with the fine folks who are working hard to make the dream of this new, expanded clinic a reality."
"According to the project foreman: the grading, cutting, and balancing of the earth is almost complete."
"Within the next few days, his crew will begin working on the building's foundation."
"It is exciting to see this important project finally come to fruition, as the new facility will allow more Veterans to receive quality care closer to home."
"Helping Seniors  Last week, I reintroduced the Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act of 2019 (H.R."
This legislation will help millions of seniors on Medicare by ensuring more timely access to the treatments they need.
"Additionally, there are more than 600 medical device companies in our state working to develop innovative and effective products."
"During a roundtable discussion in my district, I heard from many of these businesses about how these lengthy and unnecessary Medicare coverage delays create a significant barrier in bringing new products to market."
This bill is about connecting patients with important devices and technologies more quickly.
"Additionally, it is about encouraging innovation rather than stifling it."
Government has to get out of the way and streamline the payment process for effective new devices that can ultimately help improve and save lives.
"Specifically, this bill will guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to cutting-edge medical innovation by streamlining the coverage determination process and improving the availability of breakthrough devices for patients."
"Currently, Medicare does not automatically cover the latest advances in medical technology, even when the products are approved through the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) breakthrough pathway process."
"Medicares coverage determination for FDA approved products can take up to three years, delaying vital treatments to millions of seniors."
"The Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act would require Medicare to temporarily cover all breakthrough products approved through the FDAs breakthrough pathway for a three-year period, during which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must make a permanent coverage determination."
"Facilitating Financial Success  Despite slowing growth around the world, last weeks Jobs Report shows that the U.S. economy remains a bright spot, thanks to lower taxes and fewer burdensome regulations."
Watch thisvideo to learn more.
"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following message from a constituent after her fathers passport was stolen while he was visiting Paris."
"Thank you, Kristen and Tucker of Representative Bilirakiss office in Pinellas County."
Dad is now able to come home!
These ladies made sure a temporary passport was being processed before they left (LATE) on Thanksgiving break!
Youre Americas finest and we could not have done it without you!
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team enjoyed the YMCA Suncoast West Pasco Prayer Breakfast last week.
It is wonderful to see so many leaders praying for our community.
Im very excited that my team had the opportunity to begin an important conversation with the leaders of Dunedin Elementary School and Dunedin City Commissioner Deborah Kynes about a potential mental health pilot project that will provide additional services for at risk youth.
It is my belief that early intervention can make a tremendous difference.
My team also enjoyed participating in last week's graduation ceremony from the transition preparation program at the Zephyrhills Correctional Institute.
This voluntary program prepares inmates who are about to be released for successful reintegration into society.
This program has proven effective in reducing recidivism.
My team was delighted to participate in the Zephyrhills Chamber of Commerce annual Christmas breakfast last week.
The Saint Leo Chorus did an outstanding job performing for the group of community leaders.
My team was honored to participate in the Alliance for Substance Addiction Prevention (ASAP)'s annual brunch to celebrate the progress being made in Pasco County.
"Did you know that over the last year, Pasco moved from having the 5th highest drug overdose death rate in the state of Florida to the 10th?"
This is largely due to the fact that Pasco first responders are using Narcan more frequently.
Narcan helps prevent death in cases of opioid overdose.
"Last year, Narcan was used 900 times by first responders in Pasco County."
"We still have work to do in terms of improving access to treatment, but it is important to recognize the collaborative effort of our community partners as they work to combat addiction."
"Additionally, my team was pleased to participate in the Hillsborough County Medical Association's annual legislative advocacy luncheon to learn more about the issues impacting the medical community and the needs of patients."

"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk *Important news from this week:* - The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan solution that will permanently fund Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions and simplify the FAFSA -- a complex student aid form filled out by 400,000 Tennesseans every year."
"- iHeartRadio announced it will open a second headquarters in Nashville next year, which will bring even more jobs to Music City."
- Johnson City celebrated its 150th anniversary -- what a wonderful part of our state.
I know the next 150 years will bring the area even more success.
"*Remembering the life of Bishop William Graves* This week, we celebrate the life of Memphis' own, Bishop William Graves [link 1]."
I believe he was one of our nation's most consequential religious and civic leaders.
"With his quiet, strong leadership, he made our lives better and made us proud to claim him as a native son."
"Over the years, Bishop Graves became a treasured friend of my family."
We will miss him and offer his family our great respect for his life of service.
"*Simplifying the FAFSA for 20 million families and permanently funding Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority serving institutions* This week, I released and the Senate passed a bipartisan solution [link 2] that will make permanent $255 million in annual funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions and simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 20 million American families."
It's hard to think of a piece of legislation that will have more of a lasting impact on minority students and their families than this bill.
"First, it provides permanent funding for HBCUs and other minority serving institutions attended by over 2 million minority students."
"Second, it takes a big first step in simplifying the FAFSA by eliminating the bureaucratic nightmare created by requiring students to give the federal government the same information twice."
"Students give permission to the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education to share tax return data, which eliminates up to 22 questions on the FAFSA with one click."
I look forward to working with the House of Representatives to put it on President Trump's desk to be signed into law.
*President Trump approved Governor Lee's Disaster relief request for the state of Tennessee* I sent a letter this week with Senator Marsha Blackburn and Representative Mark Green to President Trump urging him to support Governor Bill Lee's request for a major disaster declaration.
This request will provide public assistance for 10 Tennessee counties in order to respond to the overwhelming damage caused by severe storms and straight-line winds in October.
I commend President Trump for quickly approving Governor Bill Lee's request [link 3].
This federal assistance will help Tennessee communities begin to rebuild and recover.
Full text of the letter is available here [link 4].
*Dr. Stephen Hahn is well-prepared to lead the FDA at this critical time* [image = The Senate health committee I chair this week approved the nomination of Dr. Stephen Hahn [link 5] to serve as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by a bipartisan vote of 18-5.
"Dr. Hahn has extensive medical and research experience and is a proven leader in large health systems -- all around, he is exactly the type of nominee we want to lead an agency as important as the FDA."
"Now it's time for him to be confirmed because there is a lot the FDA needs to do -- approve new life-saving drugs and devices, regulate tobacco and e-cigarettes, address the opioid crisis and ensure pain patients can receive the medications they need, and protect our nation's food supply."
Dr. Hahn is well prepared to lead the FDA at this critical time.
His nomination will be voted on next week by the full Senate.
"[image = *I met with Gerald Parish, Director of Recreation Education Services for the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation."
"He even brought his granddaughter to see Washington, D.C. for the first time."
"* *Senate confirms Dan Brouillette to serve as U.S. Secretary of Energy* This week, the U.S. Senate confirmed Dan Brouillette [link 6] to serve as U.S. Secretary of Energy by a vote of 70-15."
I voted last month in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to advance Mr. Brouillette's nomination so it could be considered by the full Senate.
"I supported Mr. Brouillette's nomination to serve as deputy secretary in 2017, and I was happy to vote for him again to lead the energy department."
Mr. Brouillette has visited Oak Ridge National Laboratory and understands the critical importance of the work being done in Oak Ridge.
"I'm confident he will continue to build on the progress former Secretary Rick Perry made by supporting energy research, our 17 national laboratories and supercomputing, which helps give America a competitive edge in creating jobs."
"*Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia set an example for U.S. senators* I spoke on the Senate floor this week in a farewell speech to Sen. Johnny Isakson [link 7] of Georgia, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of the year."
"I like to encourage my constituents in Tennessee to look at Washington, D.C., as if it were a split screen television."
"On the one side, you see what most people are watching -- you see impeachment, tweets and Supreme Court controversies."
"But on the other side, where very few probably watch, you see senators like Johnny Isakson working to pass an opioid bill or senators working to pay songwriters a fair amount for their work."
That is where Johnny Isakson has spent most of his 15 years.
"Johnny learned a long time ago that if all you want to do is take a position or make a speech, then you don't need to go through all the trouble of joining the United States Senate -- you can get a radio program."
He has reminded us of why we're here.
"He reminded us that, if you are a United States senator, it's hard to get here, it's hard to stay here, and while you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something good for the country."
He set an example for why we senators are here.
That is Johnny Isakson's legacy and that is something we should be grateful for.

"*The best-kept secret in Washington is record funding for our national laboratories, supercomputing and biomedical research* On Friday, I met with members of the East Tennessee Economic Council (ETEC) and told them that the best-kept secret in Washington is record funding for our national laboratories, supercomputing and biomedical research."
"In fact, Congress sent $4.6 billion to Oak Ridge last year, and the Senate is on track to increase funding for national laboratories by 42 percent, supercomputers by 64 percent and biomedical research by 40 percent over the last 5 years."
Americans invented the Internet.
And the personal computer.
We invented nuclear power.
And the polio vaccine.
Government sponsored research has helped make America the greatest country in the world.
And much of that is happening right here in the Oak Ridge Corridor.
"The Knoxville airport now has a new sign that says: ""Welcome to Knoxville: Gateway to the Smokies and The Oak Ridge Corridor."""
And it's about time we celebrate it.
"I have come to think of the Oak Ridge Corridor not as something that requires renaming a highway, but as a concept -- a regional brand that can include Maryville and Morristown, Kingston and Sevierville, and any other East Tennessee community that wants to claim it."

QA: Expanding Markets for Family Farms Q.
Why did you push to create Value-Added Producer Grants?
How does the VAPG program help independent producers?
"Quick Links As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, lowering the cost of prescription drugs has been one of my top priorities this year."
"I recently joined Ranking Member Ron Wyden of Oregon inupdating our bipartisanPrescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019and reached an agreement to fund critical, expiring health care programs.This updated legislation turns a very good bill into a great bill that will help Americans afford the prescription drugs they need.Seniors and Americans with disabilities will see even lower out-of-pocket costs."
And it achieves all of this without charging the taxpayer a dime more.
Big Pharma will also finally be held accountable to taxpayers who subsidize their billions of dollars in annual profits.
The Department of Defense (DoD) released yet another failedaudit.
"Last year, Congress authorized more than $700 billion dollars for the DoD.Thats a lot of money."
And thats why its a big deal the Pentagon is unable to account for the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars it spends from one year to the next.
Every dollar we approve for the DoD is crucial to our national security.We must ensure Americas sons and daughters in uniform are well-paid and well-equipped to defend this country.And thats why I work tirelessly to hold the Pentagon accountable.
The only way we will root out fraud and wasteful spending is by knowing where the money is being spent.
We need a clean audit and reliable accounting systems.
Watch my full floor speech here.
I recently joined Senator Warren in sending a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over its lack of action on writing rules to allow the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids and requesting a status update.
"In 2017 our bill, theOver-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, wassigned into law."
"By allowing hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, there is more competition in the market and that will result in much lower prices."
"Last October, the FDA announced that writing those rules would be a priority for the agency, but has shown no sign of progress since."
"As part of my continued oversight work, Iwrote to the World BankPresident requesting a meeting regarding recent reports of a highly questionable $50 million loan provided to a Chinese organization associated with the forcible internment of some in the minority Uighur population."
The World Bank was created to help economic development in the worlds poorest countries.
"They should not, using American tax dollars, be lending to wealthy countries that violate the human rights of their citizens and attempt to dominate weaker countries either militarily or economically."

Post of the Week   The first reading of the emancipation proclamation by president lincoln hangs above the west staircase outside the Senate floor.#realhistorychannelIt depicts Lincoln reading the 1st draft of his Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 at the White House to members of his cabinet.
"                  ABOUT  SERVICES  LEGISLATION               December 6, 2019    Connect with us                   Dear Lindsey,  Remembering Our Troops During the Holidays    With Laura Landerman-Garber  For 16 years, Laura Landerman-Garber of Hollis has been collecting holiday letters and cards from children all over the country and sending them to American troops serving abroad."
"Its always wonderful to meet with Laura, sign cards, and talk about her commitment to making the holidays brighter for our service men and women."
"Laura, keep up the great work  you make New Hampshire proud!"
Combating Illegal Robocalls  All Americans know what its like to receive countless robocalls  often multiple times a day.
"I was glad to vote in favor of bipartisan legislation  the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act  this week to help put the American consumer back in control and reduce the frequency of these incessant, disruptive calls."
"Im pleased the House and Senate came together in a bipartisan way to pass this commonsense and much-needed bill, and I urge the President to swiftly sign it into law."
"Standing Up for Critical Nutrition Assistance   The Trump Administrations announcement that it will end nutrition assistance for approximately 700,000 Americans demonstrates a clear lack of care and concern for people who are struggling to put food on the table."
Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress rejected these cuts to the SNAP program last year.
"The Administrations rule recklessly casts people from the program without considering what economic, geographic, health, and other factors may contribute to their needing food assistance."
I hope that the President will re-think this unnecessary and cruel decision.
"Getting PFAS Chemicals Out of Cosmetics   It was great to join my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues on Wednesday to hear from administration officials, cosmetic industry professionals, and environmental experts to explore how we can empower the Food and Drug Administration to ensure all cosmetic and personal care products are safe."
"Despite our progress in New Hampshire to get PFAS chemicals out of our backyards, PFAS is present in many cosmetic and personal care products."
"From makeup to shampoo, Americans deserve products free from these harmful chemicals."
I look forward to the work ahead to protect communities in the Granite State and across the nation from PFAS.
Speaking out against PFAS chemicals in cosmetics.
"Ensuring New Hampshire Workers are Treated Fairly  While its encouraging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has heeded my request to return to the bargaining table and have a fair and open discussion with American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union representatives, the EPA should have come to this decision sooner."
"These union representatives are following in the footsteps of previous generations of union members who fought tirelessly for basic fairness and justice on the job, and they deserve a fair negotiation process."
Ill be monitoring this situation in the hopes that an acceptable contract will be agreed upon in a timely manner.
I will continue to stand up for the hard-working men and women in New Hampshire and Ill keep working to ensure that workers nationwide are treated fairly and with respect.
"Building a Clean Economy   The Granite State is home to some of our nations most pristine, breathtaking lands, and we must act to protect them for future generations."
"I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing the 100% Clean Economy Act  a critical step to combat climate change, improve public health, and strengthen our economy with green jobs."
The time to act on climate is now.
I look forward to my continued work to protect all that makes New Hampshire such a special place to call home.
"A Somber but Necessary Step   This week, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House will begin to draft articles of impeachment."
I believe this is a somber but necessary moment for our democracy and to protect our national security.
"We are taking this one step at a time, and when the House Judiciary Committee advances articles of impeachment, I will evaluate each on its individual merits and content."
The House Intelligence Committees report on the impeachment inquiry uncovered substantial and uncontested evidence that President Trump abused the power of the presidency to solicit foreign interference in our election for his own political gain.
Every American should have an opportunity to assess the facts and draw conclusions from the evidence.
I encourage you to examine the evidence and reach out to my office with your thoughts.
"Giving Back to the Community        At the Friendly Kitchen    It was wonderful to join my husband Brad, members of my staff and local volunteers to serve lunch at The Friendly Kitchen in Concord on Monday- thank you Chef Carl and Val for hosting us!"

"Honoring Bill Luti  a Granite State Role Model   Like so many Granite Staters, I am looking back fondly on the life of Bill Luti, who passed away last week at the age of 98."
Bill coached cross country and track for decades at Concord High School and inspired countless young people to challenge themselves and live up to their potential.
"He was also a role model for young women, having started Concord Highs girls track and field program in the 1970s, when girls participation in sports was not taken as seriously as it is today."
My thoughts are with Bills family and friends at this time  his kind and generous spirit will be long remembered.
"Here for You  I encourage you to continue reaching out to me with any questions, concerns or ideas you have  I love hearing from Granite Staters!"
"You can contact my Concord office at 603-226-1002 or my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5206."

"The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants (), the AMIGOS Act (), which includes Portugal in the list of foreign states whose citizens are eligible for admission into the United States as E1 and E2 nonimmigrants if United States citizens are treated similarly by Portugal, a bill that provides that the amount of time that an elderly prisoner must serve before being eligible for placement in home detention is reduced by the amount of good time credits earned by the prisoner (), a resolution supporting the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and its Sixth Replenishment (), the End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act (), a resolution reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements to ensure a lasting peace in Northern Ireland (), a resolution disapproving the Russian Federation's inclusion in future Group of Seven summits until it respects the territorial integrity of its neighbors and adheres to the standards of democratic societies (), the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act (), the TRACED Act (), which will combat the illegal robocall epidemic by improving deterrence and enforcement, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act (), a resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding United States efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution (), and the Voting Rights Advancement Act ()."
It is not unusual to hear your phone ring and see an unfamiliar number come across the screen.
Robocalls have become an aggravating and persistent problem in Arkansas and across the nation.
"These types of calls are irritating and, many times, the work of scammers looking to defraud or harass innocent families and businesses."
"Im pleased to report that while impeachment has overwhelmingly consumed the House agenda, Congress was able to pass bipartisan legislation to combat this problem."
"The TRACED Act, which I am a cosponsor of, increases protections for consumers by requiring telephone carriers to verify calls and allows additional capabilities that allow consumers to block calls from scam artists."
The bill also gives law enforcement and the FCC the resources needed to track and address robocall scammers.
"Im pleased that this legislation has been passed by both the House and Senate, and I look forward to President Trump swiftly signing it into law."
"With less than 10 legislative days left on the calendar, bipartisan work that will actually help Americans, like the TRACED Act, should continue to be the priority."
"Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen."
"While Democrats remain transfixed on removing a duly elected president  with Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing that she will proceed with filing articles of impeachment  the majority party continues to hurl us towards a potential government shutdown, is refusing to bring the USMCA to a vote, and has still failed to produce a budget."
"In this vein, I sent a letter with House Budget Committee Republicans to Chairman John Yarmuth (D-KY) to express disappointment with the Democrat majoritys focus on a partisan impeachment process that has resulted in failure to make progress on fiscal issues and other Budget Committee responsibilities."
"This year has been a tremendous missed opportunity, and it saddens me to see the First Session of the 116th Congress close with no effort to address the dire budget outlook we face."
"Rather than pursuing zealous partisan investigations and impeachment, House Democrats could have worked to pass a budget resolution - the primary responsibility of this Committee - and advance bipartisan solutions to address our nations rising deficits and debt."
We need to get back to the peoples work.

"MEETINGS  This week, I had the privilege of traveling to the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia."
"As you might remember, I recently brought Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of theCDC, to the Third District."
"With this visit, we were able to build on the recent discussions we had in Arkansas to get both a local and national lens on various topics."
"TheCDCs mission is to protect America from health, safety, and security threats, both in the U.S and abroad."
"That means tracking disease challenges, developing public health initiatives, detecting and responding to health threats, supporting medical innovation, and educating the public."
"The departments purview covers a range of things, including everything from the opioid epidemic and HIV challenges to Ebola and vaccines."
"Our visit started with a discussion on the CDCs mission and its future role in public health, including efforts for data modernization."
"Technology continues to change our capabilities, and things like data modernization will allow the department to respond faster and more effectively when there are outbreaks, like measles, mumps, or even the flu."
We then sat down to talk about rural health in Arkansas and the CDCs work with local health departments and the University of Arkansas.
These partnerships enable them to closely work with community members to more effectively implement programs focused on creating a healthier Natural State.
An example of one of these initiatives includes work with schools to help children make healthy decisions to reduce childhood obesity.
"Additionally, the CDC and the U of A work together to educate the Marshallese population on issues related to preventing and managing chronic diseases like diabetes."
"The CDC also discussed their efforts to reduce drug overdoses from opioids and meth, and their work to prevent people from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place."
"Unfortunately, while many states are beginning to see their drug epidemic leveling off, Arkansas has actually seen an increase in overdose deaths."
The CDC is working directly with Arkansas and has given the state some funding to help stem overdoses.
"The CDC is tracking opioid, meth, and fentanyl use and deaths and is committed to stopping these fatal overdoses."
I then received a briefing on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and learned more about their joint efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) to stop and track the potential spread of this disease.
"Whether near or far, disease threats can't be overlooked."
"Past and present examples show how easily infectious diseases can spread across borders, land, and water."
We also learned more about how the CDC tracks disease outbreaks from their Emergency Operations Center.
"These outbreaks are not just things like Ebola and polio, but include domestic issues like Hepatitis A and the flu."
Global health security and making sure that deadly diseases are stopped before they spread is an important part of the CDCs mission and one that was clearly shown during the visit.
"I want to extend a special thank you to the CDC, Director Redfield, and all the public health experts for their productive and important discussions on public health work in the Third District and across the U.S. and globe."
The CDC is a critical part of our nations well-being and health security.
I then headed to Washington for legislative business and meetings.
I love having the opportunity to meet and learn about the amazing manufacturing companies that are located in AR-3.
It was great to welcome Glatfelters leadership and employees to D.C. to receive an update on the facility.
"The company, which is located in Fort Smith, produces a range of household products, including things like wet wipes, coffee filters, and food packaging."
Im proud of our districts strongmanufacturing sector.
My goal is to always keep this opportunity growing and to build our pipeline of skilled workers.
"The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors of Arkansas also stopped in to discuss the SECURE Act, legislation focused on helping hardworking families to achieve retirement security."
I wrapped up the week by meeting an incredible young woman from Farmington: Britney Thomas.
Britney was nominated for a RareVoice Award for going above and beyond to impact policy change for the rare disease community.
She has faced many health issues and has persevered no matter the circumstance.
"Her passion for helping others and advocating for those suffering from rare diseases is notable, and I know she will continue to be a force of change."
Wishing Arkansass Third District a great weekend!

The House of Representatives has a busy three weeks of work planned for December.
"We intend to move the Lowering Drug Costs Now Act that will allow Medicare to negotiate to lower the costs of prescriptions drugs and carry lower prices over to private insurance, update the Voting Rights Act, finish appropriations bills and consider Articles of Impeachment along with other important items before Christmas."
"Speaker Pelosi and I started the week leading a delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 to demonstrate that, despite Presidents Trumps announced withdraw from the international Paris Climate Accord, the United States will remain committed to climate action."
"I am crafting a climate action plan to help transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy to benefit our health, create good-paying jobs and tackle the rising costs of climate change."
The time is now America must lead  and in the words of that great Floridian Tom Petty show the world that the U.S. wont back down!
Yesterday the Congress passed the bipartisan TRACED Act that will help eliminate robocalls that are not just annoying but are undermining our entire phone system and consumer safety.
"Last year, our Tampa neighbors suffered through an estimated 450 million robocalls and the scams are becoming more sophisticated every day."
The Act requires carriers to offer call-authentication technology to everyone at no additional charge; requires opt-in or opt-out robocall blocking be offered at no additional charge; gives the FCC the ability to step up enforcement actions against unlawful robocalls with a longer statute of limitations and increased fines; pushes DOJ to bring more criminal prosecutions against criminal robocallers.
"Moffitt Cancer Center helped highlight the problem of robocalls within hospitals and I am pleased that the Act protects patients, doctors and hospitals from unlawful robocalls too."
The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy and for more than 50 years the Voting Rights Act (VRA) was there to protect everyones access to this basic tenet.
"Many marched, bled and even died to establish these protections."
[KC Selma photo] The U.S. Supreme Courts 2013 decision Shelby v. Holder gutted important protections to the right to vote.
"Voter suppression campaigns, voter roll purges and insidious barriers to the voting booth, including elimination of preclearance requirements in Florida swept the country."
"Now the House will restore important, modern protections to the right to vote this week with passage of H.R."
"4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act."
"CDC, NIH and FDA urged everyone over age six to get your flu shot today during my Energy and Commerce Committee hearing entitled ""Flu Season: U.S. Public Health Preparedness and Response."
"Its shaping up to be a busy flu season here in Tampa, and local hospitals are already seeing multiple strains of influenza in children and adults."
"Be sure to protect yourself and your family, as I stressed in the hearing."
The House also will vote on H.R.
2534 the Insider Trading Prohibition Act to make it easier for the government to prosecute cases against company insiders and outsiders who receive confidential tips.
This legislation is a meaningful step towards protecting the hard-earned savings of Americans and cleaning up corruption across the country by holding bad actors accountable.
"During the holiday season, dont forget to shop small in local businesses that make Tampa so special."
"Be mindful of families that need a helping hand and the organizations that make that possible like Feeding Tampa Bay that provides groceries to over 600,000 food insecure Floridians."
My recent visit was a reminder of the importance of protecting federal food assistance for the most vulnerable among us.

Join Us for our Senior Holiday Dinners  Far too many of our older citizens are struggling.
"From the high cost of prescription drugs and basic needs, to social isolation and loneliness, seniors face many challenges."
"At a time of massive inequality, it is absolutely unconscionable that some in Washington shower the top 1% of wealthy Americans with tax breaks and giveaways, while cutting programs that so many seniors rely on."
"With 10,000 Americans turning 65 each day, we should be expanding  not cutting  programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security."
"That's why I'm fighting in Washington to increase funding for the Older Americans Act, as well as Community Health Centers."
I've also introduced legislation to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and expand Social Security.

"This Vermont Couple Knows We Must Bring Down Outrageous Drug Prices   The American people pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for the prescription medications they need."
That includes tens of thousands of Vermonters.
It is unacceptable that Tom and Sue Carlson are forced to spend their precious time and energy worrying about these outrageous costs when they should be able to focus on his health and their time together.
The president's empty promises are not enough  we must act now to allow families like the Carlsons to safely import the lifesaving medications they need.
"Fuel Assistance for Vermonters  As the weather gets colder and heating costs rise, some Vermonters will have a hard time keeping warm this winter."
"If you or someone you know is struggling to pay to heat their homes, help may be available."
"Honestly, it is unconscionable that in the wealthiest country on earth anyone, let alone seniors and families with young children, is forced to choose between keeping their homes warm or putting food on the table."
"That's why I am fighting in Washington to increase funding for the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), rather than cut it like the president and his allies in Congress have proposed."
"Learn more about the resources available through our flyer, or by watching our video."

"Hosting VA Secretary Wilke in Kansas This week, I hosted Robert Wilkie, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, in Topeka and Kansas City to highlight the innovative work taking place at Kansas VA Medical Centers and speak directly with Kansas veterans, caregivers and advocates."
Showing Secretary Wilkie around our state allowed him to learn about the unique challenges facing rural veterans.
"Throughout our visit, we discussed everything from the implementation of the VA MISSION Act to legislation I introduced to improve mental health care and increase suicide prevention programs within communities."
Secretary Wilkie and I started our visit in Topeka at the Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Center.
"Thank you to the Kansas VA leaders Dr. William Patterson, Director Rudy Klopfer, Director Rick Ament, Director David Isaacks, and Director Donna Meyer-Hickel for joining us from across the state, and for all the work you do on behalf of veterans."
"During our time at the facility, we had important conversations about how we can support our nations heroes by constantly improving the VA healthcare system."
"The Topeka VAMCs satisfaction rates are among the highest in the country, and it was a pleasure to highlight the hardworking Kansans that make this possible for our nations heroes."
"Next, we traveled to Kansas City and met with veterans and advocates."
Secretary Wilkie and I answered questions about our work to improve the VA and provide veterans with the care and support they deserve.
"Together, were working hard to create a 21st century VA that is worthy of the service and sacrifice of our heroes."

"Newton City-County Airport Awarded FAA Grant Earlier this week, I to announced that Newton City-County Airport was the recipient of a $7 million Airport Improvement Program grant awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration."
"Local airports, like the Newton City-County Airport are vital to the regions economy and this grant will allow for much-needed infrastructure improvements."
"According to the Kansas Department of Commerce, the airport generates $157 million in economic impact to the local economy, and this award will enable the airport to support the areas aviation needs for years to come."
"Touring the National Weather Service FacilityOn Tuesday, I toured the National Weather Service (NWS) headquarters for the Central Region, located minutes away from the Kansas City International Airport."
"This facility handles 11 states, including Kansas, and portions of five other states."
"It serves as a multipurpose location, operating as a Training Center for NWS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and as one of two Aviation Weather Centers in the world."
"This center is designated by the International Civil Aviation Organization to provide 24-hour forecasts for aviation-related weather issues, like turbulence and icing, providing a vital safety service to people and airports around the world."

This facility is a great example of the partnerships between law enforcement agencies in Kansas and their ongoing efforts to enhance public safety in our state.

I enjoyed hearing from several producers across our state on the topic of trade and its importance to the products we grow.
I spoke on the importance of USMCA to states like Kansas and how producers are facing tougher financial challenges that make working in agriculture more difficult.
"This can be addressed by promoting our commodities, strengthening existing trade deals and creating new trade relationships."
Thank you to KFB President Rich Felts for hosting and providing a platform on which these topics can be discussed.

"Turkey Tips In celebration of the holiday season, the USDA has released some helpful tips on how to cook a turkey safely this Thanksgiving."
The USDA recommends buying only frozen pre-stuffed turkeys that display the USDA or State mark of inspection on the packaging.
These turkeys are safe because they have been processed under controlled conditions.
A food thermometer should also be used to ensure a safe minimum internal temperature of 165 F has been reached to destroy bacteria and prevent foodborne illness.
For more information regarding food safety visit USDA online or call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline.
"Defending our Democracy The Courts have been clear: the Presidents insistence that he is above the law is an offense to our Constitution and to every American.Monday's District Court decision in the McGahn case is yet another resounding ruling that the Administrations claim of absolute immunity from Congresss subpoenas has no basis in the law or our democracy, and must immediately cease."
"Again and again, the Courts have reaffirmed the Congresss constitutional authority to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people."
"As the Court ruled, It is hard to imagine a more significant wound than such alleged interference with Congress ability to detect and deter abuses of power within the Executive branch for the protection of the People of the United States."
"The judge concluded that, Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings."
"The House will continue to conduct oversight for the people, upholding the separation of powers that is the genius of our Constitution and the cornerstone of our Republic."
My office assisted a constituent in retaining his disability benefits that had been suddenly terminated by the Social Security Administration (SSA).

"Its a blessing to live in the most beautiful, diverse and interesting state in the country."
"From the Mississippi River, to the Gulf of Mexico, to the sugar cane fields and fisheries, Louisiana has been blessed many times over."
Those blessings include everyone who calls Louisiana home.
Im grateful for the opportunity to represent Louisiana and all the wonderful people who call Louisiana home because yall are what makes Louisiana such a great state.
Im especially grateful for the men and women who cant be with their families this holiday because they are fighting for our freedom around the world.
"Because of their sacrifice, we can gather around our dinner tables and cheer over Thanksgiving football games and not have to worry about the conflicts being waged overseas."
We owe them a great debt for their service.

"Across New Hampshire, Granite Staters go out of their way to make sure that others experience the joy of the holiday season."
"Concord local and owner of the Windmill Restaurant, Kosmas Smirnioudis, provides a cozy place and a warm meal to eat for anybody who walks through the door in need of a comforting Thanksgiving meal."
Students at Manchesters Parkside Middle School put together fifty Thanksgiving baskets  turkey included  for their Parkside classmates who might not be able to have such a meal otherwise.
These are just two examples of Granite Staters kindness and compassion.
"There are countless other individuals and organizations who work diligently to help those in need  not only during the holiday months, but throughout the year."
"Because we know that when we take care of one another, we all get stronger."
"This Thanksgiving weekend, I hope that you are reminded of what is most important in life, are able to enjoy the company of those around you, and take the time to give back in the Granite State spirit."

"I hope amidst the food and fun we will all find a few moments to reflect on all we have to be thankful for, and to consider how we can share that bounty with those who are struggling and in need."
"And may this holiday season bring joy and peace to our community, nation and world."
"Congress had a busy schedule last week and, among other things, completed the important task of keeping the federal government working by passing funding until the end of the year."
(I remain hopeful that we will pass the full year funding before the now December 20 deadline.)
"In addition, I was proud to join with my Republican colleague from Georgia, Jody Hice, to launch a bipartisan Congressional task force focused on ethylene oxide  an issue important to ours and many local communities across the country."
I also had the opportunity to catch up with constituents last week both remotely (during Mondays telephone town hall) and in-person (at our most recent Congress on Your Corner town hall in Wheeling).
Last week also marked the second week of public hearings into the impeachment of President Trump.
"The inquiry is now likely moving into the next phase, in which the Judiciary Committee will review the findings of the Intelligence Committee and consider whether or not to draft articles of impeachment."
"As always, I will keep you updated on this matter as well as our continued work in the House on behalf of the American people."
"LEADING ETHYLENE OXIDE TASK FORCE IN CONGRESS  Last Wednesday, I launched a Congressional task force dedicated to addressing the issues surrounding the industrial use of ethylene oxide."
"I am joined by my Republican co-leader from Georgia, Rep. Jody Hice and so far eight other members from across the country."
"Since we learned of ethylene oxide emissions last year, our Illinois delegation has been pushing the U.S. EPA to do its job, release science-based rules, and engage with our communities."
But this is an issue that stretches far beyond just our state.
"Together, we will be concentrating pressure from both sides of the aisle on the U.S. EPA to act."
Protecting the public health of our communities is not a partisan issue.
INTRODUCING 100% CLEAN ECONOMY ACT  Climate change is an existential threat our environment and our way of life on this planet.
"The United Nations has declared it an emergency requiring immediate, dramatic actions."
We are already seeing first-hand in our community its many effects.
We need to get to net-zero carbon emissions as soon as humanly possible to prevent catastrophic damage to our world.
I believe the 100% Clean Economy Act (H.R.
"5221), which we introduced last week, is a comprehensive plan to help us get to that vital goal."
I am proud to be an original cosponsor.

"                    CONTACT  LEGISLATION               Dear Friend,   Advancing Legislation to Improve Maternal Health Care  Last week, as Republican Leader of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I helped advance legislation to improve maternal health care."
"Even though there has been extensive innovation in health care and improvements in technology, recent reports have shown an increase in the number of women that are dying due to pregnancy complications.The bills we advanced would further address maternal mortality and improve the health outcomes of expectant and new mothers by strengthening Americas maternal health care workforce and enhancing coverage for pregnant and postpartum women in Medicaid and SCHIP programs."
"The bills would also help improve rural access to maternal health services, something critical for our district."
"The bills, which passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, are now headed to the full House of Representatives."
"I will continue to work hard on this issue, and I look forward to moving these bills through the House and eventually to the Presidents desk."
Working to Protect Communities from Nuclear Waste  The Energy and Commerce Committee also approved legislation that would finally fulfill the federal commitment to have a safe and permanent nuclear waste repository.
"The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2019 would ensure that nuclear waste is stored in Yucca Mountain, which both current law and science designate as the safest place for nuclear waste."
Congress first designated Yucca Mountain as the key storage facility in 1978 after scientists found it could safely store nuclear waste for one million years.
"Currently, instead of Yucca Mountain, nuclear waste is temporarily housed in facilities located in 121 different communities across the country, one being near the Columbia River at Hanford in Washington."
"Nuclear energy provides a critical source of affordable, safe, reliable, and emission-free power for our country, and its important that we have a safe storage space for nuclear waste."
"The bill is now headed to the full House of Representatives.In the last Congress, I helped lead the effort to gain bipartisan House passage of this measure.While we got 340 votes in the House, the Senate ran out of time to take it up."
"Hopefully, in this Congress, we can finally get the job done and can ensure our communities are protected from nuclear waste."
"Protecting Oregon Tourism  Oregons Second District is blessed with many great wonders like Crater Lake, the Painted Hills, Ashlands Shakespeare Festival, andthe Wallowa Mountains, to name a few."
"Tourism brings a great source of revenue to every part of our district-- you know there arent a lot of places where you can ski in the morning, windsurf in the afternoon, and end your day with farm-to-table food and local craft beer, kombucha, or wine!"
"Brand USA has helped Travel Oregon get the word out about the many wonders Oregon has to offer.Last week, I helped advance legislation that continues this important, national program which operates at NO COST to the taxpayers."
"This bill will help entice foreign visitors to Oregon and across the United States, which will boost local economies and provide more jobs."
"The bill is now headed to the full House of Representatives along with more than a dozen others measures that will help improve Oregon and our country.The other bills help defend against cyber-attacks, expand rural broadband, and provide greater consumer protection."
We made a lot of progress last week in the Energy and Commerce Committee and I look forward to continuing that bipartisan work to help improve the lives of Oregonians and Americans.
Commemorating Veterans Day in Central Oregon  I sure enjoyed celebrating Veterans Day in Central Oregon.
"On the eve of Veterans Day, I was honored to join Central Oregon Marines in celebrating the Marine Corps 244th Birthday at their Marine Corps Ball."
I delivered the keynote speech andhad the chance to meet with many U.S. Marines and their families.I also spoke with the incredibly inspiring Redmond Marine Corps JROTC.
Greg Walden presents a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Redmond Marine Corps JROTC.
"On Veterans Day, I enjoyed coffee and conversation with veterans in Bend."
Our veterans are truly inspiring and have given so much to this grateful nation.
"It is important that we give back to them, which is why one of my top priorities in Congress is ensuring that our veterans receive the services and support they deserve."
The East Oregonian published my op-ed that details the importance of standing up for our nations veterans and what Congress can do to help.
You can read my op-ed here.
Greg Walden enjoying coffee and conversation with veterans in Bend.
I also spent time with central Oregon veterans in October.
I had the chance to meet with the Redmond Band of Brothers and the Central Oregon Submarine Group.
"Additionally, I held a roundtable discussion with a wide range of local leaders in La Pine."
"We discussed all sorts of important topics including forest management, cougar and wolf management and their impacts on the deer and elk populations, and the opioid epidemic and its impact on the local community."
"Greg Walden Talks Opioid Epidemic in Southern Oregon  In October, I delivered congratulatory remarks at the Josephine County Drug Court Graduation."
"At the graduation, I listened to stories from the young men and women who were part of the 69th Josephine County Drug Court graduating class."
"It was a great reminder that while we are making progress combating the opioid epidemic, more work remains."
Greg Walden delivers congratulatory remarks at the Josephine County Drug Court Graduation.
"While in southern Oregon, I held a roundtable discussion with La Clinica and Rogue Community Health officials about what more needs to be done to combat the substance use epidemic."
The roundtable discussion was another opportunity for me to hear from those on the front lines of the crisis.
"During the roundtable, we also discussed community health center (CHC) funding and the need to ensure that CHCs are fully funded."
"CHCs serve more than 240,000 Oregonians in our district."
"In Washington, D.C., Im helping to lead the effort to provide five years of full funding for our community health centers."
"Rep. Greg Walden Attends Drug Court Graduation in Josephine County  On Friday, eight more people graduated from the Josephine County drug court, bringing the total number of grads to 416."
This drug court started in 1996 and NewsWatch12's Cassidy Delamarter is digging into the impact it's had on the community.
"Friday's graduates saved tax payers more than $277,000 dollars by choosing drug court instead of incarceration."
The program is voluntary and lasts between 12 and 18 months.
The goal is to provide high-risk drug offenders with substance abuse treatment and the support they need to recover.
"Treatment includes counseling, education and the development of a personal support system."
Charges can be dismissed upon successful graduation.

Bringing $15.5 Million Grant for the City of Medford  Earlier this month the Department of Transportation (DOT) awarded the City of Medford a grant for $15.5 million to help expand the roadway along Foothill Road and North Phoenix Road in east Medford.
"This grant is great news for southern Oregon and will allow for better flow of traffic and safer conditions for those traveling along Foothill Road, while simultaneously providing jobs and fueling the economy."
I worked closely with local officials and made the case directly to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.Im very appreciative of her and the Trump Administrations support for improving transportation infrastructure in our part of Oregon.
Rep. Walden announces $15.5 million grant for Foothill Road expansion    Representative Greg Walden announced a $15.5 million federal grant for a construction project in Medford.
The city is actively working on a project to address a number of transportation issues.
One of those projects is widening Foothill Road and North Phoenix Road by adding additional lanes.

"Commemorating the One-Year Anniversary of theSUPPORT Act Becoming Law  Last month we commemorated the one-year anniversary of President Trump signing my bill, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, into law."
"The legislation, which became law on October 24, 2018, provided the most significant Congressional effort to combat the drug epidemic."
"Today, we are seeing fewer people die from overdose deaths and more people receiving medical care for their substance use disorder.Thanks to this bill, local caregivers and organizations are getting new funds to help provide assistance to those in need all across Oregon and the nation."
"To commemorate the one-year anniversary, I attended a roundtable discussion on further efforts needed to combat the opioid epidemic."
The discussion was hosted by First Lady Melania Trump and attended by many other key officials including the Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.
I also wrote an op-ed in the Bend Bulletin that highlighted the progress made by the SUPPORT Act and discussed what work remains to be done.
You can read my op-ed here.

"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk *Important news from this week:* - This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tennessee will receive nearly $1.4 million in federal grants to help give rural Tennesseans better access to doctors, health care, school counselors and teachers."
- The Restore Our Parks Act is one step closer to becoming law.
"This legislation that I introduced will cut in half the nearly $12 billion maintenance backlog at our national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park."
"- This week, I supported and Congress passed a short-term funding agreement to keep the government open."
"*Supporting* *the Great Smoky Mountains National Park* [image = This week, the Restore Our Parks Act [link 1], legislation I sponsored that would cut in half the nearly $12 billion maintenance backlog at our nation's 419 national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, moved one step closer to becoming law."
This bill was approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee I serve on by a 15-5 vote.
"This legislation could do more to restore our national parks than anything that has happened in the last half century, and the reason we need to restore them is so Americans can enjoy these sites -- from the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the Grand Canyon -- for generations to come."
"This bill will help restore the campgrounds, trails, and roads in what one of America's greatest story tellers, Ken Burns, calls ""America's best idea"" -- our national park system."

*Considering President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration* [image = The Senate health committee I chair held a hearing this week to consider Dr. Stephen Hahn's nomination [link 2] to serve as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) commissioner.
Dr. Hahn currently serves as the chief medical executive at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
"This is a critical time for FDA, and there is a lot that FDA needs to do -- approve lifesaving drugs, regulate tobacco and e-cigarettes, complete the ongoing lung injury investigation and continue addressing the opioid crisis."
Dr. Hahn is well prepared and a strong choice to lead the FDA.
*Working to pass permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions* Now is the time to pass permanent funding [link 3] for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions.
"I spoke on the Senate floor this week after Democrats blocked my bipartisan package of higher education proposals that includes $255 million in permanent annual funding for HBCUs and simplifies the FAFSA, the federal aid application that eight million minority students fill out each year."
"Governor Bill Haslam told me that the FAFSA form is the single largest impediment to Tennesseans taking advantage of Tennessee Promise, which gives students two free years of community college."

"that would establish ""rescue committees"" tasked with creating legislation to help put the United States on the road to fiscal responsibility and get our spending under control [link 4]."
"The real driver of our out-of-control federal debt is mandatory or entitlement spending -- which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt."
"As spending on mandatory entitlements and interest grows, there will be less money for national defense, national laboratories, national parks, and the National Institutes of Health."
"Unless Congress acts within 13 years, Social Security, Medicare and the Highway Trust Funds will go broke."
"This legislation will help put the United States on the road to fiscal responsibility by bringing automatic, mandatory spending under control."
"*We should spend more on clean energy instead of wasteful wind production tax credit* This week, I spoke on the Senate floor about the wind production tax credit [link 5] -- taxpayer dollars given to wind developers."
"The wind production tax credit has been extended 11 times, has been on the books for more than 25 years, and has cost taxpayers billions of dollars."
The credit expires at the end of this year but now some members of Congress are trying to extend it.
"Asking the American taxpayer to pay more to extend the wind production tax credit - the most wasteful, conspicuous taxpayer subsidy in Washington D.C. -- is unjustifiable."
"Instead of subsidizing wind developers, we could be using that money to double the amount we spend on research and development to make truly bold breakthroughs that will help us provide cleaner, cheaper energy, and raise family incomes."

QA: Protecting Young Athletes from Abuse Q.
What recent federal law was enacted to protect young athletes from abuse?
Why did you introduce additional legislation called the SAFESPORT Act?
Quick Links After hearing consistent feedback from Iowans about the insufficient supply of liquid propane gas in the state Senator Ernst and I sent a letterurging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to consider ways to prioritize pipeline shipments of propane to Iowa.
"Ive heard from farmers, propane marketers, co-ops and manufacturers in Iowa about how the lack of access to propane is affecting operations and threatening their livelihoods.This week, in response to our letter and calls from several other lawmakers, including Governor Reynolds, FERC announced that it will begin a process to address this shortage.Ill continue to work with my colleagues and coordinate with state officials to keep a close watch as this process moves forward."
November is National Adoption Month.
This is a time to reflect on what's working in the foster care system and what more needs to be done.
"In 2018, the average length of stay in foster care increased to over 19 months."
Less than half of the kids who exited foster care were reunited with their parents.
"All children deserve a permanent home, and caring, consistent adults to nurture and guide them."
"As long as I serve in Congress, I will continue to work toward this goal."

Iintroduced bipartisan legislation to crack down on synthetic variations of performance enhancing drugs illegally marketed as dietary supplements.
"Thesesynthetic drugs, known as SARMs, are designed to mimic controlled substances like steroids and have not been approved by theFood and Drug Administration for human use.The SARMs Control Act of 2019extends the Drug Enforcement Administrations (DEA) authority to regulate anabolic steroids to include SARMs."
"Consumers deserve to know any risks associated with these substances, and the correct scheduling coupled with further DEA oversight will ensure that."

I was honored to attend several Veterans Day events.
We will continue to thank our heroes andtheir families and remember those who gave their last full measure of devotion in defense of our freedom.
Attending the Leehan Memorial Bridge dedication in Moore on Veterans Day was one of the highlights of this season for Cindy and me.
"The bridge was dedicated in the memory of Lt. Damon Leehan, who gave his life fighting for our freedom while serving in Afghanistan in 2011."
I sat down with a great group of concerned citizens known as the Mustang Positive Posse thismonth to talk through some of the issues facing our nation.
"Peppers Ranch of Guthrie recently received the Angels in Adoption award in Washington, DC."
Congratulations to this haven for families who love and care for foster children in a beautiful environment.
I stopped by the Mustang Police Department to thank them for their work to protect all of us and to hear some of the issues facing law enforcement in our communities.
"I continue to connect with Oklahoma classrooms, even when the Senate is in session, to answer questions and hear from students across our state."

Dear Oklahoma friends and neighbors:  Happy Thanksgiving!
"Next week, most Oklahomans will get to enjoy at least a day of food and family traditions."
"As you sit down with your family and/or friends to enjoy this time of gratitude for the freedoms we have as Americans and for Gods many blessings, remember those serving our nation away from their families in law enforcement and the military."
Please also consider giving to or volunteering to help others in need during this season.
"Lately, several people have told me that they dread the inevitable Thanksgiving political argument around the table and in the kitchen."
"Just about every family has some political differences, but we should not allow our political differences to separate our families and friendships."
Lets try something for Thanksgiving: turn off the news and turn on the gratitude.
There are so many good things to talk about in our state and nation.
"Find a family project to do, serve a neighbor in need, get outside, watch the parade, share old storiesanything but bringing up more politics."
Make the commitment to change the subject to something or someone you are grateful for every time someone brings up politics.
"Even though we have so many tough issues right now as a nation, maybe it would be helpful for all of us to take a break from the political noise and remember how much we have to be thankful for."
A little more caring and a little less complaining sounds like a good recipe for Thanksgiving.
"Government Funding through December  One of those ongoing, tough national conversations right now is the funding for our government."
"This week, Congress voted to once again delay the deadline until December 20 to fully fund the government through the passage of yet another continuing resolution (CR), a bill that extends funding at current levels."
"I supported the measure because, with the Houses preoccupation with the impeachment inquiry, Congress needs more time to consider and pass appropriations bills and consider government shutdown prevention legislation."
"However, every CR has consequences."
"When our government has temporary funding, federal workers worry about a government shutdown, contracts cannot be completed, agency leaders spend all their time on short-term budgets, and costs go up for everyone."
"The government is open, but it is not working well."
That is why I have worked for months to end government shutdowns and make sure short-term funding is really short term.
"My bipartisan Prevent Government Shutdowns Act has already passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), and we are currently working to bring the bill to the finish line during the current federal spending conversation."
"Oklahoma is home to 45,868 federal employees."
"Its time Congress, not the American people, were held responsible for our lack of action."
We can continue to solve our debt and deficit issues and take government shutdowns off the table by forcing Members of Congress to stay in Washington until the work is done on federal spending.

"UPDATE: Impeachment  Article 1, Section 2 of the US Constitution states, The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment."
"Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution states, The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments."

"Our states have already put in place most of the recommendations from my Secure Elections Act, so we are definitely in a better position for election security now than we were in 2016."
But there is still more work to be done.
"In addition to overall election security efforts, I recently worked with Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Gary Peters of Michigan, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin to introduce a bipartisan bill to strengthen local government cyber security defenses by switching to the .gov domain for websites and email addresses."
The DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2019 directs DHS to provide resources and assistance to local governments wanting to adopt .gov web addresses.
"The internet has become a main source of information, but you certainly cant always trust what you read or see."
"Our bill expands the federal governments ability to offer a city, state, county, or Tribal government the .gov domain, which will provide more communities access to safe, secure, online resources."
"Federal and state government agencies commonly use the .gov domain, but it is not widely used on a local level."
This trusted domain increases resilience to cyber crimes that frequently target local government systems.

"On November 4, Oklahoma City commemorated 168 days until the 25th anniversary of the tragic loss of 168 lives in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995."

"During the week of Veterans Day, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce the Protect Veterans Education and Training Spending (Protect VETS) Act of 2019, which would protect military and veteran students by closing the 90/10 loophole and require for-profit schools to secure at least 10 percent of their revenues from sources other than taxpayers."
"More than two decades ago, President George H.W."
Bush signed a bipartisan bill into law that limited how much federal funding for-profit schools may receive from taxpayers.
"Now called the 90/10 rule, this limit requires for-profit schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenues from non-federal sources."
"However, a loophole in the law excludes veteran and active duty education funds like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Tuition Assistance (TA) from being considered as federal funds."
"Some for-profit schools have exploited this loophole by using aggressive recruitment practices and deceptive marketing to enroll service members, veterans, and other GI Bill beneficiaries."
The Protect VETS Act would close the 90/10 loophole by counting VA and DOD funds as federal dollars.
This helps protect Vets from some for-profit schools that are taking advantage of them and it protects the taxpayer by forcing for-profit schools to find other sources of funds besides hard working tax payers.

"On November 13, Attorney General William Barr announced a new plan to combat gun violence in our nation known as Project Guardian."
"The plan enforces existing laws by setting federal law enforcement protocols for information sharing with state law enforcement to ensure individuals who legally are prohibited from owning, possessing, or purchasing a firearm are barred from doing so."
"I have cosponsored a bill called the NICS Denial Notification Act, which would require federal law enforcement to notify state law enforcement when an individual fails a NICS background check."
Project Guardian would enforce similar guidelines as well as greater enforcement of gun revocations from convicted domestic violence offenders and better information sharing among state and federal law enforcement regarding mental health-related denials of firearms.
"I have also cosponsored the RESPONSE Act, which provides increased resources for law enforcement and mental health training, as well as school safety to address active shooter training."
"I remain a staunch Second Amendment advocate and believe enforcement of existing law, like Project Guardian, or clarifying legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and improve training for law enforcement are helpful as we confront gun violence in our nation."

"5141), a bipartisan and bicameral bill to end the safety testing of cosmetics on animals in the United States."
The Humane Cosmetics Act prohibits the sale and transportation of cosmetics developed using animal testing and requires the Food and Drug Administration to publish a strategic plan to develop alternative animal-free testing methods for cosmetics.
"5141 is an important step towards reducing unnecessary animal testing and promoting animal-free testing alternatives that are safer, more cost effective, and are already being adopted by the cosmetics industry."
This bill demonstrates American leadership in fighting animal cruelty while supporting our cosmetics businesses.
"There is no reason to inflict painful, cruel tests to animals when better, more cost effective tests exist to ensure the safety of cosmetic products."
5141 is supported by the Humane Society Legislative Fund and the Personal Care Products Council which represents over 600 cosmetics businesses.
I look forward to partnering with the cosmetics industry and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this important legislation.

"Introduced Eight Bills to Combat Airport Noise This week I introduced a slate of legislation to address the scourge of airport noise that plagues many of our communities, including our own 14th District."
"After years of back and forth with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), it became increasingly clear that the agency was not prioritizing noise mitigation as a serious concern."
"Noise isnt just a nuisance, it affects residents mental and emotional health and overall quality of life."
My eight bills would help increase communication and transparency between the FAA and the public.
"It would also provide airports, communities, and residents with the necessary tools to take on this health threat, such as allowing airports to institute voluntary curfews and establishing a program at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to insulate homes against noise."
"I appreciate all of the hard work and engagement from residents and local elected officials, as well as my colleagues in Congress to address this issue and secure some peace and quiet for impacted communities at home and across the country."

"House Passes Major Bills in Support of Servicemembers and Veterans This week, I joined my colleagues in the House in passing nine bills supporting our servicemembers, veterans, and all those who have bravely sacrificed for our country."
Some of the major provisions included overhauling services and supports for female veterans seeking health care and survivors of military sexual trauma at VA clinics.
Other provisions amended the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) to allow family members to terminate commercial contracts on behalf of their fallen or aggrieved servicemember and directed the Department of Defense and Department of Veteran Affairs to extend timelines and modify policies for the GI Bill to ensure that servicemembers and veterans receive the benefits they are due for their sacrifice.
I am proud to have supported these bills and will remain vigilant in my fight for veterans care and rights.
"Introduced Survivors Bill of Rights to Protect Survivors Rights Nationwide This week, I introduced the bipartisan Survivors Bill of Rights in the States Act to ensure that survivors of sexual assault are guaranteed basic civil rights."
"This bill builds off the legacy of the Survivors Bill of Rights Act, which passed Congress unanimously in 2016 and established rights for survivors in federal cases."
"My bill encourages states to codify, at a minimum, similar protections."
A staggering 25 million Americans are rape survivors.
This epidemic of sexual violence is a serious public health issue that demands national outrage and attention.
"No survivor, regardless of what state they live in, should be retraumatized by a broken criminal justice system or forced to suffer the indignity of being charged for their rape kit or have their rape kits destroyed without consent before the statute of limitations has expired."
Survivors deserve better than a patchwork of laws that vary from state to state  their civil rights should be bedrock.
This is how we can restore justice to a shattered process and ensure that our brave survivors can move forward.

"In the past two years, grassroots campaigns have successfully secured ratification votes in Nevada and Illinois."
"Notwithstanding the expired deadline, which my bill would remove, we are just one state away from the final goal of 38 states."
Last weeks state legislature elections in Virginia firmly place Virginia in the position to become the final state needed to ratify the ERA and providing driving momentum for passage of this crucial amendment to make women equal to men in our Constitution and under the law.
Women are not second-class citizens.
Its time to say that in the Constitution.

Participated in First Public Hearings in the Impeachment Inquiry This week the House Intelligence Committee began public hearings in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.
"Since the whistleblowers complaint was made public, evidence of the Presidents misconduct and his attempts to engage in a cover-up has been mounting every day."
"As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I asked questions of the three witnesses we heard from this week  Charge DAffairs William Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch."
All three are non-partisan experts in Ukraine policy with a century of experience serving our country.
"Spoke at Oversight Hearing on Restrictions on Reproductive Rights in the States On Thursday, I spoke at an emotional Oversight Committee hearing on state-level restrictions on reproductive health care, including abortion."
"Box, who bravely shared her story of getting a later abortion in Missouri after learning of a fatal fetal diagnosis and that her baby would likely be born in pain."
"We also heard from Dr. McNicholas, the Chief Medical Officer of the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, the only abortion clinic in Missouri."
Both Dr. McNicholas and Ms.
Box spoke of the cruel ways in which Missouri and other states chip away at Roe by making access nearly impossible.
"Missouri has passed an eight-week abortion ban, as well as 14- and 18-week bans; mandates counseling and a 72-hour waiting period before the procedure is performed; bans private insurance coverage of abortion; requires parental consent for minors; and requires clinics to meet unnecessary and burdensome standards related to their physical plant, equipment, and staffing."
With these prohibitive restrictions its no surprise that Missouri is one of six states with just one abortion clinic.
"Sadly, since 2011, more than 400 laws have been passed that restrict and regulate abortion for medically unnecessary reasons."
"And in 27 U.S. cities, people seeking an abortion must travel over 100 miles to reach a facility."
"It was also heartbreaking to hear my Republican colleagues harass the panelists, spew hateful disinformation about the procedure and vilify those who get it."
"As one of the one-in-four women who has undergone an abortion in their lifetime, I know that these are deeply personal decisions that should be free from political interference."
"I will continue to advocate for the Womens Health Protection Act and the EACH Woman Act to safeguard access to abortion, and ensure that Roe remains the law of the land."

"Meetings with Jackie Met with Armenian Parliamentary Delegation about Partnership Between Our Nations  We discussed how much Congress and the United States are committed to helping Armenia, including my amendment allocating an additional $40 million to fund Armenias democratic reforms passed in the House appropriations bill."
Congress must continue to support Armenians as they forge a democratic future.
"Met with Senior BART Officials About Status of Public Transportation On Thursday, I met with BART General Manager, Bob Powers, and members of the BART Board of Directors about our public transportation needs."
"I have long been a supporter of public transportation, having worked on critical advancements for Caltrain, such as the Baby Bullet train."
"BART continues to face challenges as ridership increases, but remains critical to the connectivity of the Bay Area."
"Students, workers, and families rely on BART every day as an alternative to the gridlock on the bridges."
"At the meeting, we discussed BARTs future, including more trains, faster service, and improved safety measures."
"Traffic has significantly worsened in the past several years, which is why its imperative for BART to continue to grow and adapt to the Bay Areas needs."
"Voices of Californias 14th District Each week, hundreds of my constituents reach out to my San Mateo and Washington, D.C. offices to express their concerns and support for issues and get information about legislation and policies."
Every constituent who writes in receives a personal response.
Here are some issues raised this week:    58 constituents shared support for H.R.
"737, the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act."
I firmly oppose the abhorrent and cruel practice of shark finning and I am a cosponsor of this important legislation.
"This bill would ban the possession, sale, and purchase of shark fins in the United States."
34 constituents expressed support for organic food and farming.
Greater federal investment in organic food systems that promote sustainable and healthy eating habits are what we need.
"Sweeping change to our nations unbalanced and wasteful agricultural system will not happen overnight, but it will happen through common-sense reforms."
"       News from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                         November 17, 2019    Dear Friend,  While the news dominating the national headlines last week centered around the impeachment circus, I remained focused on the issues that impact the daily lives of my constituents."
"A bipartisan bill I authored to help protect Veterans passed out of the House, my bill to boost tourism passed out of Subcommittee and I introduced another bipartisan measure to improve healthcare outcomes for all Americans."
Continue reading for more information about my continued work on your behalf.
"Fighting for our Nations Heroes  Last week, the House passed my Student Veteran Empowerment Act as part of a larger Veterans' package."
My bill ensures Veterans utilizing the GI Bill are protected from unexpected school closures.
"Specifically, GI Bill entitlement benefits are fully restored to a Veteran if a school closes mid-semester without the ability to transfer credits to another institution."
"Additionally, it put safeguards in place and establishes oversight measures to help prevent school closures from occurring."
This bill is about doing the right thing for our nations heroes.
"They sacrifice a great deal in order to earn the GI Bill, and I want to ensure that those benefits arent squandered by those seeking to exploit students for financial gain."
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in expediting passage of this commonsense legislation.
Clickhere to listen to my remarks on the House Floor about this important bill.
Reducing the number of homeless Veterans in America has been a priority of mine since joining Congress.
"Last week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a 2% decrease in the number of homeless Veterans throughout the nation between 2018-2019, which reflects an approximate 50% reduction since 2009."
"Locally, the agency reports that Pasco County saw a 57% reduction between 2018-2019, and Hillsborough County saw a 12.9% reduction during this same period."
"We are making progress, however, even one homeless Veteran is one too many."
I will keep working to eradicate homelessness from within the Veteran community.
During last week's VA Committee hearing we discussed the spread of false information on social media specifically targeting the Veteran community.
We want to work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that those who prey upon our heroes are stopped and held accountable for their deceitful actions.
You can watch my exchange with panelists by clickinghere.
"Additionally, I had the chance to meet with VA Committee Ranking Member Phil Roe and VA Undersecretary of Benefits, Dr. Paul Lawrence."
We received an update on implementation of the Forever GI Bill and new Information Technology systems.
It is important that we provide oversight to ensure the VA is taking action on these important new requirements of law which are designed to help Veterans.
"Promoting Tourism  Last week, while I was reading the paper and enjoying my morning coffee, I was delighted to find an ad urging Congressional leadership to reauthorize Brand USA, the nations first public-private partnership to promote the United States as a premier travel destination."
"As co-Chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, I am proud to co-lead the bipartisan legislation, H.R."
"3851, which reauthorizes this important program."
The program is particularly beneficial to the Sunshine State.
"Tourism is the backbone of Floridas economy, generating over 1.4 million jobs and bringing nearly 130 million visitors to our state every year."
"Brand USA has helped create these jobs, reduced the national debt by $231 million dollars, and costs absolutely nothing to tax payers."
"It is important that Congress reauthorizes Brand USA, and I will continue to work hard to ensure the passage of this legislation."
"Also, the Florida Congressional Delegation met last week to discuss ways that we can work together to boost tourism throughout our great state."
Im thankful for Visit Florida and others who testified on the importance of bringing visitors from around the globe to our great state.
"Additionally, the Tampa International Airport wasnamed the best mid-sized airport in America last week."
"As someone who travels in and out of the airport most weeks, I know how much TPA deserves this special recognition."
"Joe Lopano and his team work hard to maintain a customer-centered experience, ensuring continued accessibility while allowing for the expansion necessary to boost tourism and enhance options for travelers."
"Improving Healthcare  Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, to bolster diagnostic research in medicine and improve patient outcomes."
"Our bill makes critical investments to advance research and progress in diagnostic quality, safety, and value in health care."
"In the United States, diagnostic errors result in between 40,000 and 80,000 preventable deaths and cost the health care system more than $100 billion each year."
Millions of Americans are negatively impacted by a diagnostic error each year.
Patients experience a broad range of complications resulting from these errors.
"While some patients may only encounter a minor inconvenience, many others experience worsening health conditions and even death."
"According to a 2015 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime."
"Our bipartisan legislation seeks to tackle this important issue through targeted research that will yield standards in improving the quality, safety and overall value of diagnostics."
It is an important step in improving the quality of healthcare available to Americans.
Creating healthy families starts with ensuring the health and well-being of expectant mothers.
"According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 700 women die each year in the U.S. as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications and this is significantly higher than many other developed countries."
"The Health Subcommittee began investigating this growing problem several years ago, and last year, the President signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law."
This important law improved data collection and reporting regarding maternal mortality.
"It also developed systems at the local, state, and national levels to better understand the burden of maternal complications."
We built off that essential work by passing two bipartisan bills in last weeks Health Subcommittee mark-up hearing.
"The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act, authorizes grants to identify, develop, and disseminate maternal health quality best practices, supports training for health professionals, and authorizes grants for operating innovative evidence-based programs that deliver integrated services to pregnant and postpartum women."
"The Helping MOMS Act enhances coverage for pregnant and postpartum women in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs by giving states the option of covering pregnant and postpartum women for a year instead of 60 days, which is the current timeframe."
These bipartisan bills demonstrate our commitment to continue addressing maternal mortality and improving the health outcomes in expectant or new mothers across the country.
"Protecting Human Rights  So a short Greek and tall Turk meet at the U.S. Capitol...That might be the opening of a cross-cultural joke, but the actions of Turkey's President Erdogan are NO joke."
Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter shared with me the unprecedented harassment he has suffered at the hands of Erdogan's bullying simply for pointing out human rights violations perpetrated by the Turkish regime.
"Like Kanter, I called for President Trump to cancel last week's meeting with the Turkish leader."
"A NATO ally that continues to militarily occupy an EU nation, harasses and jails journalists, denies religious freedom to the Holy See of over 300 million Orthodox Christians, violates the Exclusive Economic Zone of a sovereign nation, provocatively infringes on the air space of another, and systematically tries to annihilate the Kurds, does not deserve the ear of the leader of the free world."
"Though feet apart in height, Enes Kanter and I see eye to eye."
I will ensure his voice is not silenced as he speaks truth to power.
"#shortgreek #EnesKanter  Meeting with Constituents  I appreciated the opportunity to meet with members of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, including Commissioner Jack Mariano and School Board Member Cynthia Armstrong, during their visit to D.C. last week."
I enjoyed talking with them about the issues impacting local businesses and their legislative priorities.
"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received an email from an elderly constituent in Dade City who was frustrated that his trash hadnt been picked up in weeks."
"While this certainly isnt a federal issue, my team tries to help whenever possible."
"My staff contacted the appropriate local officials, and within two hours, the constituents trash had been removed and his account credited for a month worth of service."
He called my office very grateful for such prompt assistance.
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
"While we cant promise a positive outcome on every case, we do constantly look for ways to help constituents with the problems they are facing."
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
"It was a great morning for my team to visit the Friday morning market in Dunedin, located in John R. Lawrence Pioneer Park at the intersection of Douglas and Main Streets."
I was pleased to find out the market supports locally-based food vendors and small businesses.
My team had the pleasure of participating in the grand opening of the Bayonet Point Wound Care Center.
I am confident many patients will get great care at this new facility.
Welcome to the neighborhood!
My team enjoyed participating in the North Tampa Bay Chamber's ribbon cutting for Parks Ford.
It is great to see Central Pasco County continuing to grow.
My team had the pleasure of facilitating a meeting between Hillsborough and Pinellas county sheriff offices last week.
The discussion centered around the possible expansion of a program to bring more mental healthcare professionals to the Pinellas County Jail.
Its my commitment to help curb recidivism in correctional facilities through a combination of increased access to mental health and the utilization of innovative approaches to help offenders become productive citizens.
"My team was honored to help celebrate the 100th birthday of one of my constituents, Cosimo A. DePietto."
Captain DePietto served in World War II.
"Thank you for your service and a very Happy Birthday, sir!"
"Additionally, at last weeks Council of Organizations meeting in Dunedin, my team was glad to hear an update from Sheriff Bob Gualtieri on the work he and his team are doing to keep our community safe."
We really are fortunate to have so many outstanding first responders who protect and serve the citizens of Tampa Bay each and every day.
Thank you for reading this weeks update.

"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk *Important news from this week:* - As many as one in four Tennessee high school students are vaping or using e-cigarettes."
"This is happening at a time when thousands of Americans are getting sick, and some dying, due to vaping related injuries."
I chaired a hearing to ask government officials what they can do to prevent these injuries and the increase in youth use.
"- This week, Volkswagen broke ground on the new VW plant in Chattanooga, which is part of an $800 million expansion that will create about 1,000 new jobs for Tennesseans."
"- Farming is one of our state's most important industries, with more than 77,000 farms across Tennessee."
"This week, I congratulated the American Farm Bureau on 100 years of service."
"[image = *This week, Governor Bill Lee visited Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to protect and maintain quality health care for Tennesseans."
"* *Honoring our veterans and their families* This week, we honor the men and women in Tennessee, and across the country, who have worn the uniform of our Armed Services."
"Tennessee is proud to be the Volunteer State, and we are especially proud to honor our nearly 500,000 veterans."
"We should honor them every day for giving us the freedoms that we enjoy, the life that we live and the country that we have."
Thank you to our veterans [link 1] and their families for their service and sacrifice to our country.
"*Chairing a health committee hearing on vaping-related illness * [image = I often suggest that Americans look at Washington, D.C., as if it were a split-screen television, and this week was a good example."
"On one side, you had the House of Representatives beginning public impeachment hearings."
"But on the other side, you had a bipartisan group of senators investigating a mysterious illness [link 2] tied to the use of e-cigarettes and vaping products."
"On Wednesday, I chaired a hearing in the Senate health committee, which featured witnesses from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to learn what federal agencies are doing about the 2,000 Americans who have gotten sick, and the 39 who have died, from a mysterious lung disease related to e-cigarettes."
"And, more alarming, as many as 1 in 4 of our high school students are vaping, or using e-cigarettes."
This is an unacceptable situation that demands our attention.
"*Congress would save the lives of thousands of Tennesseans by controlling all forms of Fentanyl * Last year, more Tennesseans died from opioid overdoses than were killed in car crashes."
Fentanyl -- a synthetic opioid that can be 50 times stronger than heroin -- was the leading cause of these opioid related deaths.
"The opioid crisis is ravaging Tennessee communities, and by designating all forms of fentanyl as Schedule I controlled substances, the bill I cosponsored this week would save thousands of lives."
"When I led a delegation of five senators and two members of the House of Representatives to Beijing last year, we made fentanyl and the opioid crisis the primary point of our visit."
"According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, almost all the illicit fentanyl coming to the United States is produced in China."
"President Trump, in an earlier meeting, spoke with the Chinese president about this."
"China, working with the Trump Administration, took the first step in May by making the selling of fentanyl subject to the maximum penalty under Chinese law."
Now it is time for Congress to do the same and permanently classify all forms of fentanyl as Schedule I here in the United States.
*Protecting Tennesseans' safety at concerts and events* Tennessee attracts thousands of people who visit our state each year for concerts or music festivals.
"That's why I'm glad to cosponsor Senator Marsha Blackburn's (R-Tenn.) legislation, the Stadiums Operating under New Guidance Act, to help ensure these fans are safe and their privacy is protected."
Learn more here [link 3].
*Preserving African-American cemeteries* I cosponsored Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown's legislation to help identify and preserve African-American cemeteries [link 4] that have been lost or almost forgotten from our country's history.
"According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, most high school seniors in America score the worst in U.S. history."
"By encouraging the study of U.S. history and protecting and preserving sites like these, we will better remember these important chapters in our nation's story."
"         Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window                      November 16, 2019  Dear Friend,  It continues to be a great honor to serve and represent you in the U.S. Senate."
Last week was a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues Ive been working on.
"Sending Warm Wishes and Gratitude to Our Service Members Overseas    Shaheen and her staff participating in the Holiday Cards 4 Our Military Challenge  This week, I joined my staff in taking part in the Holiday Cards 4 Our Military Challenge, an effort organized by Laura Landerman-Garber of Hollis to deliver warm wishes and gratitude for our service members."
"All around the globe, brave men and women in uniform are defending our nation during the holiday season apart from their loved ones."
These holiday cards are a meaningful way to thank our troops for everything they sacrifice to keep us safe.
"My staff and I look forward to participating each year, and its so inspiring and heartening to see how Lauras challenge has grown from being a family tradition to becoming a national effort!"
"Stopping Drug Companies from Blocking Affordable Medication   Shaheen discussing the challenges of addressing the opioid crisis during a roundtable at Goodwin Community Health  Its vital that affordable medication is available to treat those substance use disorders, particularly in New Hampshire where this crisis continues to have deadly results for far too many Granite Staters and their families."
"Thats why I was relieved when this week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chose to heed my call to get rid of a special arrangement for a drug company that prevented affordable alternatives to Sublocade, a substance use disorder treatment medication, from coming to market."
"As a result of the FDAs decision, Sublocade will be subject to market competition from other drug manufacturers next year, rather than having market competition be delayed until 2024."
The opioid crisis is a public health emergency affecting the lives of millions in New Hampshire and the United States; drug companies shouldnt be able to game the system and block patients from getting access to more affordable medication options.
Ill continue to work across the aisle to reduce prescription drug costs and increase market competition among manufacturers so patients can afford the medications they desperately need.
Effort to Protect Firefighters from PFAS Moves Forward  Firefighters face daunting and life-threatening challenges on the job each day  the safety and condition of their own protective gear should never be one of them.
"Im pleased to report that my bipartisan legislation to address concerns regarding PFAS exposure from firefighting gear unanimously passed the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, clearing a key hurdle."
"The Guaranteeing Equipment Safety for Firefighters Act authorizes a comprehensive study of the personal protective equipment worn by firefighters to determine the identity and concentration of PFAS, as well as firefighters risk of exposure to these chemicals from the gear."
The legislation also establishes a federal grant program to help develop safe alternatives to PFAS chemicals in personal protective equipment.
Ill keep you updated on this legislation as I continue to fight for more information on the health implications of PFAS exposure and advance cleanup efforts.
"Standing Up For the Rights of Survivors of Sexual Assault   Shaheen speaking on the floor of the Senate this week on the importance of passing the Survivors Bill of Rights in the States Act  For far too many survivors of sexual assault, the criminal justice system poses many challenges to delivering justice."
Many jurisdictions put burdensome requirements on survivors to preserve the evidence in their case and often evidence is destroyed without their consent.
These hurdles can be traumatic and often re-victimize survivors.
"In 2016, I introduced the Sexual Assault Survivors Rights Act to protect the rights of sexual assault survivors in federal court, which was signed into law by President Obama."
"Many states, including New Hampshire, followed suit by passing similar laws."
"However, some states still havent improved the way their justice systems handle sexual assault cases."
"Thats why Ive joined forces with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to introduce the Survivors Bill of Rights in the States Act, a bill that would help ensure that states provide rights to sexual assault survivors."
"This week, I joined him on the floor of the Senate to urge our colleagues to support this crucial legislation."
Its time for Congress to again show survivors that we continue to stand with them and that they deserve protections and justice in our legal system.
You can watch my remarks here.
"Urging an End to Mitch McConnells Blockade of Legislation that Protects Women from Domestic and Sexual Violence   Shaheen joining her colleagues in calling on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold a Senate vote on VAWA  It has been 225 days since the House of Representatives voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), life-saving legislaiton that protects women from domestic and sexual violence."
Yet Majority Leader Mitch McConnell continues to refuse to hold a vote on this legislation.
This makes no sense and is downright shameful and outrageous.
"On Wednesday, I joined several of my Senate colleagues in urging the passage of VAWA."
"I will continue to do everything in my power to deliver this vital legislation to the Presidents desk to be signed into law so that survivors of domestic and sexual violence, and their children, continue to get the help and support they need and deserve."
Seeking Answers on Highway Checkpoints  The use of temporary highway checkpoints in Northern New England by Border Patrol agents has disrupted economic activity and inconvenienced travelers in the region.
"Reports have stated that these checkpoints, in many cases, have resulted in limited arrests."
"Thats why this Thursday, I led a letter to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) with members of Northern New England Congressional delegations seeking answers on the effectiveness of these checkpoints."
"Ensuring that we maintain effective security along our Northern border is a top priority for me, and our border protection resources must be used strategically and effectively."
You can read my letter here.
Contact My Office  One of my most important responsibilities as a U.S.
Senator is assisting New Hampshire residents who need help navigating federal agencies.
"Ive worked with my staff to help Granite Staters avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, deliver delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance, and access VA benefits, among many other services."
"If you have an issue with a federal agency, you can open a casehere."
"If the matter is time-sensitive, you can call my Manchester office at (603) 647-7500."
Here are a few examples of how my office has helped Granite Staters.
"David Amato, Fremont: David and his business partner contacted my office after their small business lost their health care coverage when their premium payment failed to go through."
My staff proceeded to follow up with the insurance company.
"After repeated follow-up from my staff, the insurance company worked with David and his partner to make their premium payments current, resulting in their business regaining its health insurance coverage and David and his partner were able to access medical treatment that they had put off while this was pending."
"Sandra Moriarty, Stratham: Sandra contacted my office seeking an update on the status of her sons application to the New Hampshire Veterans Home and for assistance with disability benefits through the Social Security Administration."
"My staff began to follow up with both organizations, ensuring that Sandra was kept informed of updates and information she needed to send on her sons behalf."
"Her sons disability claim was approved, and he is now waiting for a bed to become available at the NH Veterans Home."
"James and Madeleine Gilbert, Manchester: James was critically ill while waiting for a decision on his appeal for a service connected disability from the VA."
"Sadly, James passed away days before the Board of Veterans Appeals issued a decision in his favor."
"My staff worked successfully with Madeleine, his wife, to ensure she received the benefits she was entitled to as the widow of her late husband."
"As a result, she was able to stay in her home."

"            Nov. 10 - Nov. 15, 2019                 This week started with Veterans Day, which Senator Romney spent in Utah sending off a group of veterans from Salt Lake City on their Honor Flight and at a commemoration ceremony honoring 11 veterans at the University of Utah."
"Once back in Washington, the Senator continued advocating for Congress to address the vaping epidemic at a Senate Health Committee hearing on the topic with officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)."
"Senator Romney also participated in the nomination hearing for FEMA Administrator, where he brought up concerns related to wildfire prevention and recovery efforts, and met with several groups of Utahns."
A brief recap of his week can be found below.
We owe a debt of gratitude to each of our veterans for their service and sacrifice on behalf of our country.
Senator Romney recorded the below video message for Veterans Day to express his appreciation to our nation's veterans.
"On Veterans Day, Senator Romney participated in the University of Utah's Veterans Day Commemoration where 11 Utahns were honored."
Information on this year's honorees can be found here.
Senator Romney participated in an Honor Flight send-off for a group of Utah veterans in Salt Lake City.
"The Honor Flight Network is an organization that transports our nation's veterans to Washington, D.C. to visit and reflect at the memorials."
The rate of vaping-related illness in Utah is 6x the national average.
"In addition, our country now has more than five million young people addicted to nicotine."
"At a Senate Health Committee hearing examining the response to vaping-related lung illness, Senator Romney urged the FDA and CDC to work with Congress to address this epidemic."
"He also detailed his legislation, the ENND Act, which representatives from both agencies agreed would benefit the public."
Full story by Dennis Romboy here.
Senator Romney met with NCAA President Mark Emmert to express his views on the need for student athlete compensation.
The Senator will continue working with the NCAA and with advocates to find a solution that compensates student athletes while preserving the integrity of collegiate sports.
"At a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on the nomination of Peter Gaynor to serve as FEMA Administrator, Senator Romney spoke about the importance of FEMA stepping in to provide resources to prevent the wildfires from getting out of control."
The Senator also spoke about the need to apply private sector thinking to the Federal Flood Insurance program.
"Department of Agricultures Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP), is an important tool to help Western states recover from wildfires."
"However, state and local partners across Utah have faced hurdles when trying to access these funds."
Senators Romney and Bennet (D-CO) called on the Government Accountability Office to review the EWP so it effectively serves communities across the West as they recover from devastating wildfires.
The letter can be found here.
"As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Romney met with Jovita Carranza, nominee to serve as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, prior to her nomination hearing."
"Senator Romney met with several groups of Utahns this week in Washington, including:   Bonnie Hilton of Herriman, Utah's 2019 Angel in Adoption honoree."
"Julie Fullmer, the Mayor of Vineyard."
"Tara Rollins, Executive Director of the Utah Housing Coalition."
"                  Carper's Connection        November 15, 2019 Dear Friends, For more than two decades, communities across the country have come together on November 15th to observe America Recycles Day and celebrate their commitment to recycling."
"This year, I spent the morning talking about recycling with a group of students at Dover High School  the home of the Senators!"
"These students are taking the lead on recycling through Teen Vision, a community service group at Dover High that does great work like food bank drives and raising funds for breast cancer research."
"Every Wednesday, as many as two dozen students spend half an hour recycling bottles, cans, paper and other items at the school."
"I can tell you this, if Senators in D.C. have the same passion for recycling as the Senators at Dover High, well be in great shape."
"Fortunately, a number of U.S."
"Ive been a strong advocate for recycling for 50 years, which is what eventually inspired me to start the Senate Recycling Caucus."
"As co-chair and co-founder of the Senate Recycling Caucus, Im partnering with my Republican colleague, Senator John Boozman of Arkansas, to lead the caucus in exploring ways in which the federal government can encourage more recycling."
"This year, our bipartisan caucus has held four briefings with environmental, business and local community leaders to learn more about the state of recycling in America today."
"Earlier this week, Senator Boozman and I introduced and successfully passed a resolution in the U.S. Senate to commemorate today, November 15th, as America Recycles Day."
Ibelieve we have a moral obligation to be devoted stewards of the environment and to leave our planet in better shape than we found it.
"Lately, I have been thinking about a quote from Martin Luther King: Everybody can be great, because anybody can serve."
"This call to service reminds me of recycling because almost anyone can help protect our environment by reducing the waste they produce, and by recycling."
"Over the years, I have recycled almost everything you can imaginefrom a green Ford Explorer to paint cans to electronics."
"Just last weekend, I recycled a dehumidifier, a bundle of outdoor tree lights and a ton of other stuff, too."
For a small state like Delaware  which is 100 miles long and 50 miles wide  recycling is particularly important because we just dont have a lot of space for landfills.
"Unfortunately, today, the recycling industry is facing unprecedented challenges, especially when it comes to plastics."
"According to the EPA, the United States recycles less than 22 percent of our discarded materials."
"If we continue down this path, the World Economic Forum predicts that we are on track to have plastic pollution outweigh fish in our worlds oceans by 2050."
We need solutions that are win-wins for our economy and for our environment.
I believe recycling is one of these win-win solutions.
"On top of cleaning up our waterways, reducing emissions and cutting the need to extract new resources, recycling and remanufacturing industries are beneficial for our economy - accounting for more than 750,000 jobs and approximately $6.7 billion in tax revenue."
Its also estimated that diverting 75% of U.S. waste from landfills and incineration to recycling by 2030 would create 2.3 million jobs!
"As I love to say, its possible to do good and do well at the same time."
Recycling is something that just about every American can do each day to make a difference.
"So, please join me in celebrating America Recycles Day  and then, lets make every day America Recycles Day!"
                                       Pushing for Action to Combat the Youth E-Cigarette Crisis in New Hampshire and Across the Country According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) there are more than 5 million youth e-cigarette users nationwide.
And in New Hampshire this statistic is even grimmer: New Hampshire has the highest percentage of high school students in the nation reporting daily use of e-cigarettes.
"To make matters worse, the American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that only four percent of those kids will successfully quit."
These alarming statistics demand immediate action.
"In September, the Trump Administration announced that it would ban flavored e-cigarettes, which have been linked to the increase in youth e-cigarette use."
"However, the Administration is dragging its feet on following through on that promise."
"This week, I pressed the Director of the Center for Tobacco Products at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Mitch Zeller, about how the FDA plans to ban e-cigarette flavors that are most popular among young people  following up on concerns that Juul could simply rename a flavor to skirt the ban."
"Mr. Zeller could not provide a straightforward answer, and I emphasized that the stakes of this crisis couldnt be higher."
"The agency has had plenty of time to implement a strategy, and while the FDA stalls, millions of Americans, including young people, are becoming addicted."
You can watch my questioning of Mr. Zeller here.
I will continue working with members of both parties to tackle this crisis and prevent even more of our young people from becoming addicted to nicotine.
"With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan What the Senator is Working On This week, Senator Hassan led her colleagues in introducing bipartisan legislation to support and expand programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a collaborative effort across the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont to use market-based tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector."
"Senator Hassan also introduced two bipartisan bills with Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia to help states, cities, and towns spur investment in rural broadband projects."
"The bills complement ongoing efforts in New Hampshire to provide local governments with innovative financing options for broadband projects, giving states and localities additional resources to invest in rural broadband."
"Additionally, Senator Hassan questioned Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the Federal Reserves role in responding to unfair Chinese trade practices and the Administrations trade policies that are harming New Hampshire businesses."
"Photo of the Week This week, Senator Hassan joined Laura Landerman-Garber to help write holiday cards for service members around the world as part of her 16th annual Military Holiday Card Challenge."

"                            Home  About  Newsroom  At Your Service  Representing Hawaiis Values  Contact                        November 13, 2019    Aloha,    Telehealth, or the ability for people to use technology to connect with their doctors, is an issue that has broad bipartisan support."
We have been able to get several provisions that were in our original telehealth legislation passed into law or adopted by federal agencies.
The technology is advancing and more providers and patients are relying on it.
We recently introduced new legislation that would build on the progress we have made and allow an increased use of telehealth through Medicare.This bill will help ensure that every American gets the care they need no matter where they live.
We have also received several pieces of good news about federal dollars coming toHawaii.
The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the state $20 million to build a new pedestrian bridge to help make the Ala Moana area safer; Hawaii Island non-profit The Food Basket received a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to expand its programs statewide; and the U.S. Air Force has approved Kauai's Pacific Missile Range Facility as its approved alternative for the Air National Guard's Space Control Squadron.
"As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawaii if there is anything we can do."
"Mahalo,    Brian Schatz  United States Senator                Expanding Care Through Telehealth Senators Schatz, Roger Wicker (R-Miss."
"), John Thune (R-S.D."
"), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.)"
"introduced the Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) for Health Act of 2019, bipartisan legislation that would expand telehealth services through Medicare, improve health outcomes, make it easier for patients to connect with their doctors, and help cut costs for patients and providers."
"According to studies, telehealth has been shown to improve care and patient satisfaction while reducing hospitalizations."
The CONNECT for Health Act of 2019 builds on the progress made in recent years to increase the use of telehealth through Medicare.
"Specifically, the legislation would:   Provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority to waive telehealth restrictions when necessary; Remove geographic and originating site restrictions for services like mental health and emergency medical care; Allow rural health clinics and other community-based health care centers to provide telehealth services; and Require a study to explore more ways to expand telehealth services so that more people can access health care services in their own homes."
Schatz and the Senate telehealth working group first introduced the CONNECT for Health Act in 2016.
"Since then, a number of provisions have been signed into law or adopted by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services."
"Todays updated version includes new key measures health care experts, providers, and patient advocates agree will help improve access to care and drive down costs."
"For a copy of the bill, click here."
A summary of the bill is available here.
AffirmingHawaii's Strategic Role in National Security The United States Air Force announced it has approved Kauai's Pacific Missile Range Facility as the preferred alternative for the Air National Guards Space Control Squadron.
"By selecting a site on Kauai, the Air Force will create a new, highly technical squadron to monitor U.S. satellites in support of the national security space mission, ensuring that the military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence, and key information."
"The unit will also support 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions, including 29 full-time positions and 59 part-time, drill-status positions."
"This decision reaffirms the importance of Hawaiis strategic role in our national security and is proof that the men and women of Hawaiis Air National Guard are the best in the world, said Senator Schatz, lead Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs."
"While this new unit will help strengthen the Air Forces space capabilities and advance our national security interests, it also means more federal funds for the state and more opportunities for local jobs."
"The Air Force anticipates completing the basing process by summer 2020, with the squadron becoming partially operational in fiscal year (FY) 2021 and then fully operational by FY 2022.The Hawaii Air National Guard was one of the first units to respond to Kauai following the April 2018 flood."
"HIANG continues to be a critical partner to the ongoing response and recovery efforts, and we are pleased to hear of the increased presence here on island."
"We welcome the additional employment opportunities for our local folks, particularly in the areas of Science, Math, and Technology, said Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami."
Protecting Against Agricultural Threats Senator Schatz called on Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to step in and provide immediate support to efforts to control and eradicate the invasive longhorn beetle before it devastates Hawaii Island.
"The threat to U.S. agriculture and Hawaiis environment justifies immediate, strong intervention from the federal government in order to prevent harm to the U.S. economy and federally managed lands in Hawaii - especially while the threat of A. Aesthetica is still confined to a fairly limited area on Hawaii Island, said Senator Schatz."
"Federal land managers should act in coordination with the state, county, and private landowners to implement the practices identified by researchers to contain, mitigate, and hopefully eradicate A. Aesthetica."
"The invasive beetle, known by the official name A. aesthetica, is causing extensive damage to trees by burrowing through their trunks, and ultimately killing them.The insect poses a threat to Hawaii Islands growing number of cacao farmers, and endangers culturally important plants such as the kukui and breadfruit trees.If the beetle spreads to the U.S. mainland, it would pose a direct threat to the $3.85 billion citrus industry."

"Ensuring Accountability Senator Schatz, lead Democrat on the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, called on telecom companies to provide answers on the islandwide phone, internet, and cable TV outage that occurred last week on Kauai."
"According to reports, the outage lasted for at least a day for many residents."
"Many in the community voiced complaints about Spectrums response and their failure to provide quick, relevant information to residents about the outage, and more importantly, information on when services were expected to be restored."
Hawaii is uniquely vulnerable to service disruptions due to the limited number of undersea cables supporting telecommunications for the islands.
"Companies serving Hawaii must account for these challenges and ensure that the infrastructure they count upon to deliver service is reliable, Senator Schatz wrote."
"In his letter to service providers Spectrum, Verizon, and CenturyLink, a co-owner of the fiber-optic cable line that reportedly caused the outage, Schatz requested a detailed account of what occurred, why information was not immediately communicated to residents, and why it took a prolonged period of time to restore service."
The outages on Kauai are a good example of how failed infrastructure that has not been made redundant can disrupt the lives and businesses of Hawaii residents.
"I am particularly concerned that the outage appears to have contributed to interruptions of 911 services, which could have had potentially serious consequences, Schatz continued."
The full text of the letters are available here.
"Sharing Our Unique Stories  Members and Staff from theHawaii Government Employees Association visited Senator Schatz's office in Washington, D.C."
"Senator Schatz met with Vic Barrett, a youth climate activist who has spoken at COP21 and the United Nations."
Team Schatz participated in the first annual Walk for Hope in honor of Congressman Mark Takai.
