"          The Bost Bulletin Friend,  As we celebrate Presidents' Day tomorrow, it's important to note the impact each president has had on our nation's history, including Illinois' own Abraham Lincoln."
His dedication to freedom is a shining example of the values our country represents.
Here's what I've been up to this week.
"Protecting Our Children in Schools Having the Securing Our Schools Act, a bill I introduced, signed into law by the President is one of my proudest achievements while serving in Congress."
This law created the School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) to provide law enforcement with the appropriate tools and technology they need to make classrooms safer.
"Starting this week, the SVPP is accepting applications through April 8, 2020 for this years round of grant funding."
"For more information, please visit here."

Safeguarding Veteran Votes Ensuring Americans have a say in who leads our government is a right our veterans overseas fight for every day.
"Too often, however, our men and women serving across the world are unable to have their absentee ballots arrive to the States on time for the collection deadline.This is completely unacceptable, which is why I am proud to tell you that I have cosponsored the Counting All Military Votes Act to improve voting accessibility for American active duty service members."
Our military men and women overseas are committed to keeping American diplomats and citizens safe and deserve peace of mind knowing that their ballot will be counted in a timely manner.
"Empowering the Postal Service Since its creation in 1775, the USPS has remained one of the most reliable government agencies."
"In fact, it is one of the few explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution."
"Today, the USPS employs over 600,000 workers and continues to be an integral function of our government and economy."
"However, due to a mandate passed over a decade ago, the USPS is obligated to pre-fund its future pensions, losing the agency millions of dollars every year."
"I'm proud to tell you that legislation I cosponsored, the USPS Fairness Act, passed the House last week."
This bill will make sure that employees within the USPS will receive the same retiree health funding benefits that apply to all other federal agencies and allow the USPS to invest in itself for the first time in years.
"Prior to its passage, I spoke on the House Floor in support of this legislation."
"To hear my remarks, please click the link below."

"As a Marine and father of a Marine, I was honored to take part in this small gesture of appreciation for those who have served our nation."
"Protecting Correctional Officers Our district is home to United States Penitentiary Marion, but like many facilities, it is not staffed at the proper level."
Studies show that understaffed facilities have more assaults against workers and more inmate suicides.
"Recently, I led a letter asking the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide the Bureau of Prisons with direct-hiring authority, which would allow individual facilities to hire the staff they need on their own timelines.This week, I was honored to accept the Legislative Appreciation Award from the Council of Prison Locals for my work on this issue and will continue to make sure the safety of correctional facility staff and inmates is a top priority."
Investing in Illinois Waterways I met with Illinois members of the Waterways Council to discuss the funding and maintenance of our system of inland waterways and ports.
"With millions of tons of cargo transported on the Mississippi River every year, this issue is one of my top priorities."
"As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I will continue to make sure Southern Illinois's waterways are taken care of."
"Meeting with Southern Illinois Community Colleges Earlier in the week, I had the chance to meet with Interim President Dr. Kathleen Curphy and Don Patton with Shawnee Community College as well as several administrators and trustees from John A. Logan Community College to discuss access to grants, lowering costs of tuition, and bolstering job training for career and technical education (CTE) programs."
"As a member of the Congressional CTE Caucus, I will continue to support these critically important programs."

This week was filled with many exciting developments.
"I introduced legislation to fill the remaining gaps in the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act, that ensures all federal employees are guaranteed 12 weeks paid family leave after the birth, fostering, or adoption of a child."
"It is important we provide working families with resources to care for their young children, in order to achieve a fulfilling work-life balance in our modern economy.?"
"Additionally, I offered an amendment in the Oversight and Reform Committee while discussing DC Statehood."
The amendment would ensure all children born alive after an abortion attempt are granted the full right to life just as any other child would have.
The Constitution guarantees the right to life for all citizens and we must do everything we can to stand up for our most innocent and smallest ones.
"Unfortunately, this amendment failed along party lines."
Watch my full testimony by clicking the picture below.
The House also voted on the Equal Rights Amendment this week.
"Ispoke  in opposition of this legislation because it would create the basis for taxpayer funded abortion at the federal level, would force healthcare providers to perform abortions, and would permanently allow abortions up until the moment of birth for any reason."
This attack on life is tragic.?
"As always, do not hesitate to reach out to any of my offices in Washington, Huntington, Beckley, and Bluefield."
I am here to help you and greatly value your input.
"Sincerely, Carol Miller Member of Congress Issue of the Week: Encouraging Our Girls to Join STEM Wednesday was Girl Day on the Hill!"
I joined with DiscoverE and Collins Aerospace to encourage young girls to explore a STEM career.
"Did you know that 50% of the workforce is women, but only 28% of the STEM workforce is women?"
We need to change that.
"If we provide an environment that gives girls the confidence and assurance they need to choose a STEM career, we can close this gender gap within our next generation."
"       News from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                          February 16, 2020     Dear Friend,  Last week, I had the privilege of speaking on the House Floor to recognize President Lincoln's birthday."

ALS a debilitating and horrific disease that claims the life of many Americans far too soon.
"Additionally, a disproportionate number of Veterans have been diagnosed with ALS, which is alarming."
"I have long been a supporter of legislation and federal funding designed to increase research that will lead to better treatments and cures for rare diseases, like ALS."
"However, as an active member of the ALS Caucus, I will be able to do even more."
"I join this caucus in honor of Doug, who is a constituent, a Veteran and a friend of mine."
Doug has bravely battled ALS for almost 15 years.
"I am inspired by Dougs courage, his familys commitment and by his best friend, Gary, who has become a fierce and vocal advocate for all ALS patients who struggle with this disease."
"Together, I am optimistic that our Caucus can be a catalyst for change and that we will do what it takes to find a cure."
It was great to meet with local leaders from Advent Health Hospitals last week.
They were in town to discuss how we can improve transparency in healthcare costs and protect patients from surprise medical bills.
Surprise medical billing typically occurs when a patient receives an unexpected bill after a medical procedure due to items that were not covered by his/her insurance.
"As I promised the leaders from Advent Health, I will continue to work on fixing this problem."

This is just one of the multiple ways that I communicate with my constituents on a regular basis.
I look forward to the opportunity to provide a brief update of what I have been working on in Washington and answering your questions.

My bill would ensure that seniors and those with disabilities are considered when developing regulations for this new technology.
Strengthening Strategic Alliances  Andy Athens and Maynard Wishner led efforts by Greek- American and American-Jewish communities to strengthen ties between Greece and Israel.

"While Congress holds the Article I powers of the Constitution, or the power of the purse, the Presidents budget outlines his vision for the nation.The release of the Presidents budget request historically kicks off the congressional budget process in both the House and the Senate."
It serves as a starting point for lawmakers to make spending decisions and analyze the economic outlook for the coming year.
The framework of the budget process can be divided up into :   President submits the budget to Congress House and Senate mark up and pass budget House and Senate conference the budget resolution Consideration and passage of Appropriations bills Consideration of reconciliation/authorization Start of new Fiscal Year (October 1st)   I applaud President Trump for putting forward a budget proposal.
"Thats more than we can say for the Peoples House, where, for the second straight year, the Democrat majority has failed to produce a budget."
Thats not leadership.
"This is interesting to me because, on the House Budget Committee majoritys website, there is a section titled Responsibility."
"The first sentence in this section reads, The Committees chief responsibility is to draft an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that provides a congressional framework for spending and revenue levels, the federal surplus or deficit, and public debt."
"In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done."
"Yet, here in the House, in the greatest country in the world, were not doing a budget."
"Simply put, a failure to budget is a failure to govern."
"We must start doing our job to put our country on a sustainable, responsible fiscal path."
"This is our duty to the American people, not promoting budget-busting policies, including Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, that will leave future generations saddled with the consequences of House Democrats eagerness to spend with no way to pay."
Its time for Democrats to stop punting one of our most basic responsibilities in Congress.
Im ready for them to join us at the table to do the difficult work.
While we cant analyze the Democrats budget  because they wont put one forth  the House Budget Committee did hold a hearing on the Presidents FY 2021 budget proposal withOMBActing Director Russell Vought.
"As we discussed, the proposal seeks to balance our fiscal constraints with the need to fund the priorities of the country, including national defense."
"The Presidents budget includes deficit reduction measures, specifically $4.6 trillion between 2021-2030."
"This is a strong start, but more work remains to be done to put our country on a solid fiscal path."
"Moving forward, it is imperative that we work together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to advance a budget that funds our nations important priorities while acknowledging our very real fiscal challenges."

"The next morning, I invited my Republican House Budget Committee colleagues to join me at the Office of Budget and Management to hear more about the Presidents recently released budget proposal, as well as fiscal priorities of the White House."
"As I mentioned earlier, I appreciate the Administration for drafting a budget."
"Congress should be doing the same thing, but House Democrats have refused to put forth a proposal yet again."
"In the real world, everyday Americans and Arkansans are held accountable for their income, expenses, and savings."
"Main Street job creators and business leaders are held accountable for demonstrating fiscal restraint, for making tough choices, and for setting priorities."
Congress should not be any different.
"But in the House, Democrats are refusing to put forth the very document that tells us what we need to know about how much were spending, what were raising in revenue, and the impact of our deficits and debt on our economy and the nation."
The American people deserve better.
"Representatives from NorthWest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) were in Washington, and I had the opportunity to hear some important school and curriculum updates."
"We talked about enhancing Career and Technical Education (CTE), the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act  which I voted for  and the National Science Foundations Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program."
"NWACC just received an ATE grant for a project that will create a Technical Certificate in Integrated Design to help expand the skilled technical workforce, especially in construction fields and engineering design."
"NWACC is helping prepare our students for the jobs of today and the future, and I appreciate their dedication to providing quality education and opportunities in the Third District."
"I thank Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson, Dr. Ricky Tompkins, Jim Hall, Rachel Harris, and DeAnne Witherspoon for their time and work!"
I then met with the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police.
I always appreciate meeting with our law enforcement officers and hearing more about their work to protect and serve our communities.
"We discussed many issues, including The Protect and Serve Act (HR 1325)."
"Im a cosponsor of this legislation, which creates new federal penalties for individuals who deliberately attack or attempt to cause significant bodily injury to any law enforcement officer."
This bill aims to deter attacks against police officers who have increasingly been targeted and face higher levels of hostility because of the uniform they wear.
Im extremely thankful for the work of the men and women who wear the badge each day!
My next meeting was with the Enlisted Association of the Arkansas National Guard.
"It was wonderful to sit down with Arkansas National Guard members from Fort Smith and other parts of the state to talk about their work, duties, and programs that support their efforts."
We also had a productive discussion on the National Guards role going forward in the Space and Cyber domains.
The Arkansas Air National Guard has both Space and Cyber missions.
"As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas ArmyNational Guard, I salute their service and thank them for their commitment to the Natural State and our nation!"
"I then welcomed Dr. John Lorsch, Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, to my office to speak about the Institutional Development Award (IDea) program and its impact on Arkansas."
Our conversations focused on the NIHs research and biomedical investments within the Natural State.
"I wrapped up the day at the National Guard Association, where I joined National Guard members from across the country to talk about defense efforts, legislative advocacy, and my work on the House Budget Committee."
"I shared stories about my time in uniform, as well as my perspectives on appropriations work in Congress."
"I talked about the constrained resource environment we face, and how growing mandatory spending is squeezing the portion of discretionary funding available for national priorities."
"The Guard brings great value to the fight, and it was my honor to talk to this great group and answer questions."
"The next morning, I met with Dan Hendrix, President and CEO of the World Trade Center Arkansas."
"I appreciated an update on their work, economic development in the community, small business grants, and the impact of recent trade deals on the state."
"Arkansas is a state of opportunity, and the World Trade Center Arkansas is a pivotal resource that has supported bilateral trade services, global connections, and export development programs for local businesses."
"Our region is full of opportunity, and it was great to speak with students from the Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program."
FLEX students spend an academic year in the U.S. living with a volunteer host family and attending high school.
"The students, who are from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are currently living and going to school in Russellville and Springdale!"
They said that they have learned a lot during their time living and studying in the region  and that they love the sense of community in Arkansas!
Modernized infrastructure is vital to keeping our communities economically competitive and strong.
"It was great to wrap up my week in Washington with Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.We had very productive conversations on rural infrastructure grants, local projects like I-49 and regional airport improvements, and budget and appropriations.We also highlighted the importance of addressing U.S. infrastructure needs using smart and effective methods that provide results and maximize our resources."
"Today, I also want to wish everyone  especially my wonderful wife, Terri  a Happy Valentines Day!"
I'm grateful that my office was able to present some special valentines to residents at Methodist Village Senior Living in Fort Smith.
Spreading some cheer and happiness is what this day is all about!
Im looking forward to being back in the district and traveling the Natural State next week.
Wishing everyone a Happy PresidentsDayon Monday!
Let us reflect and honor the leaders who've held our nation's highest office to serve the American people.
"By swearing an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, they each answered the call to lead our great country throughout history."
"From George Washington to Donald Trump, Happy Presidents' Day to all our leaders  past and present!"

"                                               Dear Friends, This week, I introduced H.R."
"5863, the Student Loan Marriage Penalty Elimination Act."
This legislation addresses growing student loan debt by making the student loan interest tax deduction work better for married couples.
Current law penalizes married couples by only allowing them to take one deductioneven if both spouses qualify.
This bill would stop this unfair tax on student loans against married couples while also helping individuals with their student loan debt burden.
"For decades, hardworking Americans have been saddled with student loan debt which has delayed their dreams of achieving financial stability."
I am proud to lead this effort to maximize the student loan interest tax deduction that married couples can claim each tax year.
"This allows married couples to put more towards paying off their student loans, incur less interest, put more food on the table, or save a little more for a down payment on a home."
"This unfair marriage penalty came to my attention after Claudia McHale, a constituent from Garden City, discussed with me the situation of her niece and her husband."
"Both of them paid towards reducing their student loan yet were only able to claim a $2,500 deduction between the two of them, the same maximum amount a single individual can claim every tax year."
"As Claudia said, it is ridiculous that the federal government punishes taxpayers with student loan balances just because they get married."
"__________  On Tuesday, I received the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council."
"This recognition is awarded to Members of Congress with a proven record of defending the right to life, religious freedoms, and family values."
It is truly an honor to represent Missouri's 4th congressional district as we fight for our foundational values.
"Legislative Update On Thursday, Democrat leadership in the House attempted resurrect the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) through Congress."
"I commend the women who have gone before us, to celebrate the achievements women have made, and to reaffirm the fact that we are already equal in the eyes of God and in law."
"Women make up 51% of the population, comprise over half of college students, make up most of todays medical and law school students, and own the majority of new businesses."
"Little girls can be whatever they want to be whether that be an astronaut, a doctor, a full-time mom working at home, or a Member of Congress."
"In addition, federal law and court precedent uphold our rights."
That is something to applaud and I do.
"However, todays legislation is problematic on several fronts."
"First, the resolution is unconstitutional."
The time limit to pass the ERA expired decades ago.
Congress cant go back and remove a deadline from a previous constitutional amendment initiative.
"The Supreme Court has recognized that the 1972 ERA expired, and the Department of Justice issued a ruling saying, Congress may not revive a proposed amendment after a deadline for its ratification has expired."
Pretending we can remove the time limits for passage is both futile and deceptive.
"Secondly, if the time limit COULD be extended, the ERA would not bring women any more rights than they currently have but it would entrench the legality of abortion."
We know this from court precedent and by listening to those who have the most to gain from constitutionally protecting abortion on demand.
"In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Rights Amendment in their state constitution requires state-funding of abortions."
Federal courts are likely to do the same.
Perhaps this is why every major pro-abortion organization is endorsing passage of the ERA.
"NARAL Pro-Choice America says: With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion."
National Organization for Women: An ERAproperly interpretedcould negate the hundreds of laws that have been passed restricting access to abortion care.
But thats not the only concern with passing this resolution.
"Besides being unconstitutional and shredding state and federal pro-life protections, the ERA would also erase decades of progress which have provided opportunities for women, advanced womens progress through federal programs, and secured necessary protections for women and girls."
"By incorporating gender identity in the definition of sex, jeopardizing private spaces for women, girls sports programs, and womens educational institutions."
"By banning distinctions between men and women, the ERA also endangers laws, programs and funding designed to benefit women."
"The ERA provides a pathway for legal challenges to welfare programs, grants for battered womens shelters, efforts to bolster women participating in STEM programs."
These outcomes of the ERA are anything but pro-woman.
"I urge my colleagues to vote No on todays resolution and uphold the Constitution, promote life, and protect womens rights that have been so hard-fought gained."
District Update I am so pleased to tell you about an honor recently won by Columbia Public Schools.
"Project Tomorrow is a national education nonprofit dedicated to ensuring thattodays students are well prepared to be tomorrows innovators, leaders, and engaged citizens of the world."
"Project Tomorrow is recognizing Columbia Public Schools with its annual Speak Up District of Honor award, an honor given to school districts for leadership and commitment to listening to the voices and views of students, parents, and educators."

" News from Representative Courtney                                              Dear Cormack,  Following a busy week in Washington, here with a few updates on several priorities for eastern Connecticut."
Honoring Those Lost on 10thAnniversary of Kleen Energy Explosion  Last Friday marked ten years since the tragic explosion at the Kleen Energy Systems power plant in Middletown.
"The blast injured dozens of workers, and it took the lives of six: PeterChepulis, RaymondDobratz, Kenneth Haskell, RoyRushton, Chris Walters, and one of my close friends, Ron Crabb."
"On Sunday, I was in Middletown along with colleagues, community leaders, and friends and family of those who were lost in the tragic accident, to honor and remember those who never came home that day."
"Ten years ago, workplace safety laws failed these six individuals, and the dozens of others who were injured in the blast."
"Nothing can ever make up for the lives lost that day, but we have a responsibility as a community and as a Congress to ensure we do all we can to protect Americas workers."
"Last year, on the 9thanniversary of the explosion, I introduced the Protecting Americas Workers Act (PAWA) to strengthen and modernize the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA)  which hasnt been meaningfully updated by Congress in over 50 years."
"The bill is simple, and contains some common-sense measures like improving whistleblower protections; requiring the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to investigate all cases of death and series injuries that occur within a place of employment; and establishing rights for families of workers who were killed on the job by giving them the right to meet with OSHA investigators, receive copies of citations, and more."
The lives lost ten years ago deserve to be honored with action.
"To read how PAWA makes workplaces safer, click here to visit my website."
"Rep. Courtney joined community leaders, friends, and families at a memorial service for those lost in the Kleen Energy explosion     Bipartisan Action on Surprise Health Care Billing  Surprise medical bills are a crisis waiting to happen for so many families in eastern Connecticut and across the country."
"When people are ill, the last thing they should have to worry about is how to safeguard themselves against complex billing technicalities that result in surprise, sky-high medical bills."
"The cost of health care is a top-line issue for folks in our region, and surprise billing is a major contributor  my office has received far too many calls from people in eastern Connecticut who have not been treated fairly."
"Weve already taken steps in the House to curb the cost of prescription medication, and this week we took on surprise billing."
"On Tuesday, my colleagues and I on the house Education  Labor Committee voted to approve the bipartisan Ban Surprise Billing Act (H.R."
"5800), a bill that would protect patients from devastating surprise medical bills, and would finally give them the financial confidence and peace of mind they deserve."
"These protections would be for everyone  for people who receive health care through their employer, and for those who are enrolled in the individual market."
"Erica Moser did a great job covering the ins and outs of the bill in her article for The Day, click here to read more."
One of the most exciting parts about H.R.
"5800 is that its so bipartisan  it was supported by both the Democratic Chairman of the Committee, and by the Republican Ranking Member."
"People in Congressional Districts across America are impacted by surprise medical bills, and its great to see Members from both sides of the aisle coming together to address the problem."
"I commend Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for working together to advance this bipartisan bill, I was proud to support it, and Im looking forward to voting to pass it when it comes before the House for a final vote."
Click here to watch Rep. Courtney's remarks in favor of H.R.
"5800     Meeting with National Defense University Students  On Tuesday, I hosted a large group of students from the National Defense Universitys Eisenhower School to discuss some of the top priorities on the horizon for our Armed Forces and the industrial base, and to learn more about their work as students focusing on undersea warfare."
"As always, these NDU students were totally impressive  they came to study in Washington from all across the U.S., represented a variety of branches, backgrounds, agencies, and experiences, and were sharp and well informed on our national security strategy and priorities."
Our conversation turned in large part to the flurry of activity weve seen in Connecticuts defense manufacturing sector recently.
"Up and down the supply chain, skilled manufacturers and small companiesare seeing new opportunities for work."
"Connecticuts defense manufacturing is booming, but even that good news presents its own challenges  mainly, how can we make sure that we have a workforce thats skilled and well educated enough to take advantage of these new opportunities?"
"The answer to that question has been the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Boards revolutionary job skills training program, the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative (MPI)."
"The MPI was kick-started with a $6 million federal grant that I helped to procure back in 2015, and since then its flourished alongside our states burgeoning manufacturing sector."
The MPI has helped Electric Boat (EB) to grow by thousands of employees in just a few short years.
"In the last year alone, EB reported that they made over 1,000 hires directly from the pipeline."
"The MPI is exactly what was needed to fill the ranks of a booming manufacturing sector, and its been a total success for our region."
"It was great to host this impressive class of National Defense University students in Washington this week, and to discuss with them all of the moving parts that must work in unison to deliver the tools are Navy and Armed Forces need."
"Students from the National Defense University met with Rep. Courtney at his Washington, DC office      The Start of a Months-Long Budget Process  Earlier this week, the White House released their official 2021 budget request."
"Ultimately it is Congresss job to craft and pass a budget through the House and the Senate, and its the President's job to sign it."
"However, the start of the budget negotiation process typically begins with the White Houses budget request  their proposed budget  and this year were off to a strange start."
"The White Houses proposed budget makes $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other health care programs over the next 10 years."
"It also slashes investments that help workers find and keep good paying jobs, and altogether eliminates bedrock programs that help fund Americas public education system."
"Thankfully, this is just the start of a months-long budget negotiation process."
"The proposed budget introduced by the White House yesterday has already received criticism from both sides of the aisle, and its not going to make it through Congress as-is."
"Its not encouraging to see the White House kick the process off with a budget proposal that points so many important programs in the wrong direction, but as the House moves into our own budget negotiating process, we have an opportunity to work together across the aisle to get it right."
"It will remain our top priority in the House to protect and defend the health, financial security, and well-being of millions of Americans as we begin debate on the 2021budget."
Proposed Shipbuilding Budget Receives Bipartisan Criticism One of the components of the 2021 budget request that has generated significant bipartisan concern is the plan to cut back on shipbuilding investment for our Navy.
"Congress had traditionally worked together to provide strong support for the Navys plans to build, modernize and support a strong fleet of ships, submarines, destroyers and other vessels critical to our national defense."
"Contrary to expectations, however, the budget we received this week took a significant step backwards  proposing to purchase just 7 ships, a sharp reduction from the 10 that the TrumpAdministration itselfplanned for this year and a nearly 20% reduction in the budget for shipbuilding."
"Incredibly, one of the cuts included the reduction of a Virginia-class submarine, with only one requested in 2021."
This plan flies in the face of more than a decade of testimony from our defense leaders about the unmatched value of our submarine force and increasing alarm about shortfalls in the fleet.
Its even in direct contradiction with the Trump Administration's own plans for our Navy and defense strategy.
"Given that every submarine we build will be in service for four decades, the decision to plan for only one new submarine next year is short-sighted."
"As Chairman of the HouseSeapowerand Projection Forces Subcommittee, I can say with certainly that this budget is dead on arrival."
"Throughout the week, bipartisan concern about this proposal has grown across Congress and I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to dig into this surprising plan as we begin our work on the 2021 budget."
"Click here to read about some of my efforts, and the bipartisan reaction to the budget."
Click here to read Rep. Courtney's bipartisan letter to Secretary Esper     Thank you for taking a moment to read my weeklyeNewsletter.
"Its an honor every day to represent eastern Connecticut, and Im grateful that youve made my weekly update a part of your weekly routine."
"                 Dear friend,  Every year, we celebrate Black History Month and honor the countless accomplishments of African Americans across the United States."
"The contributions that our great heroes andsheroes giants like Dr. Martin Luther King, Maya Angelou, and Shirley Chisholm  made to the fight for civil rights and social justice cannot be overstated."
"But as we celebrate our progress, we must also take time to reflect on the systemic challenges our communities still face, and how much further we have to go."
"African Americans still experience disproportionate levels of poverty, incarceration, and inequality in education and economic opportunities."
Thats whyIm hosting a town hall next Fridayto reflect on the work that still needs to be done.
"We need to protect and expand voting rights so that everyone has a say at the ballot box; get counted in the upcoming Census to ensure everyone is represented in our government; and defeat Trumps new, cruel budget proposal that would harm our nations most vulnerable."
"I hope youll join me at 6 pm on Friday, February 21, at Beth Eden Family Life Center, located at 1183 10th Street, Oakland, CA 94607.Please RSVP here."
"As always, my office is here for you."
"If you need help with a federal issue, please call my Oakland office at (510) 763-0370."
"       L            In the span of my obstetrics career, I delivered more than 3,000 babies."
"Not only did I have the joy of seeing these babies when they were delivered, but throughout my career I witnessed great advances in the technology that allowed doctors and parents to see these children developing in the womb."
"For those of us who have watched a baby squirm and kick during a sonogram, there is no question about the sanctity of life."
While my work has changed through the years  I now spend late nights delivering policy rather than babies  my dedication to pro-life medicine remains steadfast.
The legislation that came before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health this week would put women's health at risk.
"The Women's Health Protection Act of 2019, would codify into law that access to an abortion is essential to womens health."
This is contrary to the Founders of this country who believed in a right to life.
The federal government should work to overcome the factors that lead to abortions and should support well-crafted legislative proposals that directly address these factors.
That is not this bill.
MY WEEK President Trump delivered his budget to Congress.
"In line with his State of the Union address, the Best is Yet to Come, this is a budget for Americas future.It lays the foundation to balance the budget over the next 15 years by stopping unnecessary spending.The budget continues the Presidents priorities to rebuild our military, secure our borders, protect our economy, andremain energy independent."
I joined Government CIO to discuss the benefits of electronic health records and of AI in health care.
After that I participated in an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce hearing on autonomous vehicles.
"Autonomous vehicles will reduce traffic congestion, improve mobility for the elderly and individuals with disabilities, and could significantly improve safety for all who use our roadways."
"The Hill published my opinion article about the future of energy policy in America: ""A Free Market for a Clean Future."""
"Yesterday, I attending the visitation for Midshipman Duke Anthony Carrillo of Flower Mound, Texas."
I had the honor to nominate him and his two brothers to a U.S. Service Academy.
He was an aspiring young man.
May others learn from his example and follow in his footsteps.
POLL OF THE WEEK                         President Trump released his budget this week.
"I appreciate that the budget includes additional funds for a border wall, border security and technology, and hiring additional Custom and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement law enforcement officers."
"             -->              Dear friends and neighbors,  This week, House Democratstook a stance and fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).It is far past time for the women of this country to be included in our nations Constitution, and we will continue to fight to ensure no American is treated differently on the basis of gender.My vote for the ERA was a vote for equality!"
Heres what else Ive been up to:   Fighting for Working Americans         I had the pleasure of meeting with AFGE Local 556to discuss the progression of federal employee rights in our country.
"Federal employees are the backbone of our government,and I am proud to be a part of conversations that aim to advance their rights!"
Supporting Our Sheriffs         I also enjoyed meeting with the National Sheriffs Associationto discuss mental health issues as they relate to the law enforcement systems in our communities.
"Mental health is extremely important to our collective well being, so I am always eager to discuss ways in which we can improve our services in this area."
"Caring for the Blind         This past year, we were able to secure $2.375 million for the Library of Congress E-Readers for the Blind program."
I was happy to meet with Floridas branch of the National Federation of the Blind to discuss how we can increase education and economic opportunities for the blind.
"Fighting to Keep Families Together          I had a particularly inspiring meeting with Americans Family United, who stopped by to share their stories with me."
"Together, we will fight to give people a second chance and keep families united!"
"Meeting with Our Young People    As the future of our country, its inspiring to see young bright students from Polk State so heavily involved in our government."
Its always a pleasure to have a piece of our district here at our Nations Capitol!
Thanking Our Nation's Veterans           I celebrated Valentine's Day with the brave men and women who served our nation.
It was an honor to drop off hundreds of handmade cards to the Lake Nona VA Medical Center!
To all the veterans out there: you are loved and appreciated beyond measure.
"A special thank you to Ventura, Boggy Creek and Sand Lake Elementary Schools for making the cards."
Supporting Our Veterans         I spent the afternoon at theVeterans Art Competition!
It was truly inspiring to see how veteransmake art and use creative practices to transform themselvesafter their service.
Fighting for Clean Water         Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental right.
"Yet, the Trump Administration is keen on cutting back funding of lead prevention programs, putting Central Floridians at risk.My committee, Energy and Commerce, is fighting todo more to address this national crisis!"
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
" News from Representative Waltz        February 14, 2020                             Dear Ms. Cormack, Thank you for reading my newsletter!My team and I continue to work for you and our community."
It was a very eventful week and I'm excited to tell you about what we accomplished.
Here are some highlights:   I was the Grand Marshall for the Ninth Annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade I toured the Indian River Lagoon to see living shorelines and learn more about preserving our environment I attended the signing of the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act by President Trump at the White House I spoke on the House floor in recognition of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and her contributions to our community and country  CELEBRATING OUR RACING HISTORY: This weekend I had the honor of serving as the Grand Marshall of this years Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade!
"Since the 1920s, Daytona Beach has been the home ofNASCAR, with drivers setting records racing down our beach to the famous North Turn and A1A."
This race is an important part of our communitys history and its always one of my favorite events every year!
Serving as Grand Marshall at the 9th annual Historic North Turn Legends Beach Parade  CONSERVING OUR SHORELINE:Our beautiful and natural shorelines can co-exist with development when done correctly.
Living shorelines and mangroves are important for our communities because they are the best natural barriers against storm surges.
Estuaries and mangroves are also important to commercial fisherman.
"Around 80 percent of them rely on estuaries and mangroves for spawning.I enjoyed touring our local living shorelines to learn more about how conservancies bring free market, volunteering and community based solutions to our community."
It's important we maintain our living shorelines to help keep Florida resilient.
"Views of our Indian River Lagoon living shoreline  SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS: This week, I went to the White House to see President Trump sign another bill supporting our veterans into law  and this time, it was a bill I co-sponsored!"
"TheSupporting Veterans in STEM Careers Actsupports our veterans, helping them find opportunities for jobs in STEM fields when they return to civilian life."
"I was gladto work on this bill with two fellow Florida congressmen, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Neal Dunn, and I was proud to be there as the President signed it into law!"
President Trump signing the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act into law RECOGNIZING SERVANT LEADERSHIP: I can't think of anyone better to highlight great servant leadership in our community and our country this Black History Month than our district's very own Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune.
"Bethune founded and was President of the all African-American girls school in Daytona Beach, which later becameBethuneCookman University."
"Bethune selflessly dedicated herself to fighting for the equality and civil rights of all Americans through education and because of her, Florida and America are a better place."
"Latest News Impeachment is finally over After more than four long, divisive and counter-productive months, impeachment is finally over and the president has been rightfully acquittedthe actions of the president did not warrant the charges."
Congress has been stuck at a standstill for too long.
"Having been sworn into Congress only a week prior to the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, I am thankful this storm has passed and I can finally begin the legislative work eastern North Carolinians elected me to do."
"Congress could and should have been working on issues like healthcare, prescription drugs, border security and more instead of this tiresome and illegitimate impeachment."
"Hopefully, we can finally get back to tending to the business of the people."
"Unfortunately, I doubt that will be the case after the petty and partisan theatrics displayed by Speaker Pelosi at the State of the Union address."
Bipartisan efforts that would benefit the American people will likely be forgone due to the Speakers disdain for the president and her fear of giving him legislative victories.
America deserves better.
What's going on with coronavirus?
"As a physician and member of Congress, I wanted to give you all an update on the status of the coronavirus and how the United States is working to combat its spread."
Watch the video below to learn more.
Surprise billing There is bipartisan agreement that surprise billing is a major problem for patients and families across America.
It desperately needs to be addressed.
While Im glad we discussed the best path forward to alleviate the problems of surprise billing during a markup of H.R.
"5800 in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week, this legislation is not the right solution to this problem."
Even though I couldn't support H.R.
"5800 in its entirety, I was glad to improve it with two amendments that were adopted unanimously."
"As a physician, I'll continue to utilize my expertise on these issues to lower the cost of healthcare and increase patient access to provide Americans with the greatest treatments possible."
"Watch my opening statement below: Veterans HOPE Act Last week, I was proud to introduce the Veterans HOPE Act to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans."
"Between 2010 and 2016, deaths due to opioid overdose rose by 65% among veterans."
"During those same years, veteran deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by roughly five-fold."
"Meanwhile, the rate of prescription opioid receipts within three months before death declined by more than 25%, suggesting that opioid overdoses are likely stemming from hard or synthetic drugs, without knowledge of the initial prescriber."
"To combat this issue, the Veterans HOPE Act would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to further investigate deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids."
"Upon conclusion of the study, the Secretary would report findings to the public and Congress and suggest veteran overdose prevention efforts to save lives."
"As a member of the North Carolina State Assembly, authoring the main legislative actions to combat the opioid crisis in North Carolina was one of my proudest achievements."
"Now as the U.S. Representative of a Congressional District with the fifth most veterans in America, the Veterans HOPE Act is especially important research to me."
The data speaks for itselfveteran deaths caused by non-prescribed opioids like heroin and fentanyl have skyrocketed.
But our veterans are more than a statistic.
"They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers who have selflessly sacrificed so much for our great nation."
It is our duty to do all we can to protect them from the dangers of opioid addiction.
You can read the bill here.
"District Highlights George Henry White Commemorative Stamp Act Honored to introduce legislation this week alongside several of my North Carolina colleagues to honor George Henry White of New Bern, a Republican politican and the last black member of Congress during Reconstruction."
"George Henry White courageously stood up to racial injustice in a hostile time period for African Americans, especially in the South."
The cause of Civil Rights in this country was only advanced because of strong and brave leaders like him.
It was only fitting that we honor such a historic African American figure during Black History Month.
You can read more about his life and legacy here.
"Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office Almost one year after Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.'s passing, Im pleased that a bill I introduced in his honor advanced through the House of Representatives."
"This measure would designate a post office in his hometown of Farmville, the ""Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office."""
"It was altogether fitting that my first piece of legislation as a member of Congress be a tribute to my predecessor, friend and mentor."
"Walter cared deeply for the people of eastern North Carolina, especially the Marines who serve at Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point and New River."
He epitomized what a public servant stood forhis constituents.
"I greatly appreciate my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation for unanimously supporting this bill, and I hope the Senate and President Trump will swiftly act to make this bill a law."
You can watch my remarks from the House floor in support of the bill below: Christina Koch Returns to Earth Congratulations to Christina Koch for completing her 328 day mission in space!
Welcome back to planet Earth!
Christina grew up in Jacksonville and attended NC State.
Her time aboard the International Space Station set the record for the longest single continuous spaceflight by a female.
"Such a tremendous accomplishment for North Carolina, the United States of America and all of humanity."
"Welcome home, Christina!"
You can read more about her record-breaking flight here.
"District Work Even though I've been in our nation's capital for the past two weeks, I've met with numerous people and organizations from North Carolina, many of whom are from the Third District."
Scroll through the photos below to see some of the people I met.
Had a productive discussion about how Congress can impact state and local narcotic issues with Sgt.
"Kevin Black, Lt. Daniel Duckworth, Sgt."
"Mike Dawson, Special Agent Joe Barringer and Sgt."
Enjoyed talking with representatives from the Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource Council.
Forestry is such a vital part of the economy in eastern North Carolina.
These gentlemen work at International Paper's facility in New Bern.
I learned a great deal about this wonderful renewable resource.
"It was an honor meeting UNC Chapel Hill's Athletic Director, Bubba Cunningham, and other senior athletic department officials."
We talked about college athletics and issues relating to student-athlete compensation that are affecting the NCAA.
"Met with Tom Gentile, President and CEO of Spirit AeroSystems to discuss their business and presence in North Carolina."
Such an honor to attend the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit with President Trump and several of my colleagues from the North Carolina Congressional delegation.
Cutting taxes and red tape has helped create jobs and raise wages across every demographic.
We have helped stressed areas of our country by raising people out of poverty with jobs and pride.
So much better than creating more government dependency.
I will continue to support this administration and its pro-growth policies while serving the great people of eastern North Carolina.
"It was great meeting with Winston Salem Special Olympics athlete, Jennifer Wardlow, and President and CEO of Special Olympics North Carolina, Keith Fishburne."
The Special Olympics is a truly fantastic organization.
"Honored to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, with several of my colleagues from the North Carolina delegation."

"As a physician, I always enjoy discussing how we can improve America's healthcare system."
Had a productive discussion with representatives from National Rural Health.
"Access, equity and quality of healthcare are especially important issues in places like eastern North Carolina."

"Pathway to Peace This week, I introduced a package of seven bills that outline a bold progressive vision to reimagines the countrys approach to foreign policy as one that centers human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of Americas engagement in the world, and makes military action a last resort."
I have firsthand experience with how destructive war can beand I see how our continuous involvement in foreign conflicts is not making our country or our world any safer.
"I believe that when the United States says it champions human rights, democracy, and peace, we should mean it."
Eritrean Asylum ENSURE Act This administration will stop at nothing to make life painful for people of color seeking a better future.
"Not only has the President added Eritrea to its latest Muslim Ban, but he is also now threatening to deport Eritreans who have settled here."
Thats why I introduced the ENSURE Act to stop the United States from deporting Eritreans fleeing state oppression.
"The bill places a two-year stay on removals; prohibits the detention of Eritrean nationals during removal procedures; and, requires up-to-date reporting on Eritreans facing imminent removal."
"The PRO Act As a former union member myself, I can attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right to organize."
"Thats why we need the PRO Act, which puts power back in the hands of workers where it belongs."
"It will address the challenges and attacks that labor unions have been facing for decades that have led to the erosion of wages, a spike in workplace discrimination, and dangerous growth in inequality."
Unions dont only raise wages.
"They create working class solidarity between workers across gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."
"Trump Budget This week, the Budget Committee held a hearing on President Trumps latest spending proposals."
"The administration's new budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stampswhile continuing the Presidents disastrous tax breaks for the rich and while increasing wasteful spending on endless wars."
"We need a budget for the people that invests in housing, education, healthcare, and addressing the climate crisis, not a budget that benefits billionaires like the President."
"            February 14, 2020               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Passing Bill Increasing the Number of Agricultural Specialists for U.S. Customs and Border Protection  This week, I voted in favor of the Protecting Americas Food and Agriculture Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored."
"This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year."
This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model.
It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference.
"In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area."
I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our countrys food and agriculture interests.
"Read more here,  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products."
"The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient."
"This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products."
"Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store."
"Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as milk."
I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law.
"Dropping the Puck in Glens Falls to Stick It to Cancer and Helping Kids Learn to Skate   This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the community ""Try Hockey for Free"" event in Glens Falls, where I helped introduce many young constituentsto the sport of hockey."
This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game.
"NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!"
"Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce."
It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing.
"In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease."
"I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases."
I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.
"I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army."
"We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards."
I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act.
I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress.
"Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events."
The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees.
This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires.
"Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance."
"This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base."
"Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving onour embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts."
This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted.
"As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical."
Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders.
"Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots."
We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and Im honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress.
Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown.
"The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities."
"Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns."
"Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities."
I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.
"Writing an Op-Ed Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Miracle on Ice  This week, I wrote an op-ed commemorating the 40th anniversary of the iconic Miracle on Ice and celebrating the North Countrys rich Olympic history."
The op-ed was published inThe Sunthis week.

"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:    ___________________  Featured Read:  Times Union:State, federal lawmakers clash over access to DMV records  U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for ""absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies"" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases."
"Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines  though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks."
"""New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,"" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon."
"""They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens."""

"              -->               Dear friends and neighbors,  Yesterday, President Trump released his budget for Fiscal Year 2021, and his proposals are just another example of his complete disregard for the well-being of working class Americans in Central Florida."
"He is cutting $1.6 Trillion from YOUR Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs."
"Not only does his budget contradict his statements at last Tuesdays State of the Union, it backtracks on promises he has made over and over again."
"Instead of using his budget to fund critical programs that are working for Floridians, like you, President Trump is:   Cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security: President Trump has broken his promises to seniors and families by slashing half a trillion dollars from Medicare, taking $900 billion from the lifeline of Medicaid, and cutting Social Security Disability Insurance."
"Hurting students: The Trump Budget cuts federal student loan initiatives by $170 billion, eliminates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness initiative, and harms children in Central Floridas public schools by cutting billions from the Department of Education."
"Abandoning farmers and hungry families: While Central Florida farmers are declaring bankruptcy at record rates, the Trump Budget slashes nearly $60 billion from the farmer safety net and steals more than $180 billion in nutrition assistance from families struggling to keep food on the table."
"Just in Central Florida, there are over 200,000 residents using SNAP to put food on the table that otherwise they would not be able to do."
"Cutting investments in jobs and the future of our communities: The Trump Budget breaks last years bipartisan budget agreement by slashing a total of $1.6 trillion dollars in the health, education, safety and global security of Central Floridians."
Contributing to the national debtby extending the GOP Tax Scam for the rich.
Make no mistake  I will continue to work with House Democrats to stand firm against the Presidents broken promises and keep fighting for ALL Americans.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
"                        CONTACT  MEDIA                Dear Friend,  This week, the White House formally released the President's budget proposal for FY 2021."
Ordinarily this would begin the annual process of reconciling the administration's budget with that of Congress.
"However, House Democrats failed to even propose a budget last year."
"They refuse to propose a budget and begin the process of negotiating how the federal government should allocate its resources because their socialist agenda would make everything  from health care, to college, and more  government-provided, devastating the nation."
"Also, the Ways and Means Committee held a mark-up this week on bipartisan legislation to address the issue of surprise medical billing."
Continuing reading to learn more about this important piece of legislation.
Addressing Surprise Medical Billing The Ways and Means Committee held a markup on a bipartisan piece of legislation dealing with surprise medical billing.
"I would like to thank Chairman Neal (D-MA) and Ranking Member Brady (R-TX) for their dedicated work on this thoughtful piece of legislation that protects patients and brings providers, insurers, and hospitals to the table to share in the responsibility of fixing this issue."
"As a practicing dentist, I cant emphasize enough that we need to have a balanced approach to expand provider networks, not shrink them."
"Our bill makes sure that patients come first, but is also fair to both provides and payers in determining a solution."
"While no solution is perfect, I believe out framework is the best approach to the issue of surprised medical bills and a step in the right direction."

"1384) eliminating virtually all public and private health insurance and replacing with a new government plan, and weve heard a lot of talk about Medicare for All from the Democrat candidates for President."
"Do you support this policy which is now the prevailing position of Congressional Democrats/Presidential candidates?"""
"In response to this survey, 88% said they do not support ""Medicare for All"", while 12%of Third District respondents answered that they did."
"I also asked: ""President Trump recently announced Phase One of the China trade agreement along with signing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement."
"As he looks to pursue free trade agreements with the U.K., EU, and Kenya, do you support the Presidents trade agenda? """
"In response to this survey, 90% of Third District respondents answered they do support the President's trade agenda, while 10% answered that they did not."

"       A Message from the Congresswoman Dear Friend,  This week, the Trump Administration released its proposed budget for the next year."
"It comes as no surprise that the proposed budget is devoid of compassion and empathy, and proposes massive cuts to education programs, housing programs, and critical social safety net programs like Medicare and Medicaid."
"Budgets are statements of our values, and Im committed to ensuring that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 federal budget affirms equity and justice for all across our district and our country."
"Now that the FY 2021 Budget proposal has been released, Congress will begin its appropriations work to develop funding bills that reflect the values of the people."
What is the appropriations process?
"To determine how federal dollars get spent, Congress conducts an appropriations process every year."
"The appropriations process determines how much federal funding goes to government agencies and programs - everything from our schools, to our hospitals, to major infrastructure projects."
"Too often, though, the appropriations process takes place behind closed doors."
Decisions about how to spend valuable resources are made with little to no input from our communities.
"Last year, hundreds of advocates and constituents engaged with our office on appropriations priorities, ensuring that those closest to the pain are closest to the power - driving and performing policy making."
How can I be involved?
"The appropriations process for FY 2021 is officially underway, and I am seeking your partnership as I work to advocate for the federal resources and programs that serve our communities across the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District."
"If you or your organization would like to advocate for a certain federal program, you can submit an appropriations request through this form."
"The deadline for submissions is Friday, February 28th at 5:00pm EST."
"Last year, we were able to secure millions of dollars for federal programs that support community based violence prevention, school based health centers and healthy food options in schools and other critical youth programs."
Im grateful for your partnership and I look forward to working together to ensure that our federal budget reflects the values we espouse in the Massachusetts 7th.
"Together, we can secure robust federal resources critical to addressing the issues of consequence for communities across our district and the across the nation."

Butterfield (NC-01) and Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12) introduced a resolution recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four Sit-In of 1960."
The resolution recognizes the four students for their contribution to the Civil Rights Movement and encourages all States to include this historical account in their educational curriculum.Read the press release and full resolution here.
"Background:    The Greensboro Four sit-in protest took place on February 1, 1960."
The Greensboro sit-in was a civil rights protest that commenced when four young Black students staged a sit-in at the segregated lunch counter of F.W.
"Woolworth Department Store in Greensboro, North Carolina."

"Over 600 Black leaders from around the country joined the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C. to call national attention to two critical issues facing the Black community: the 2020 Census and Voting Rights."
Both have implications for the development of Black communities in the short and long term.

"Legislative Update       On January 30, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congressman Billy Long (MO-07) introduced theProtecting Natural Gas Consumers from Overcharges Act of 2020."
"The bipartisan bill aims to protect natural gas consumers, residential and industrial, from overpaying for their use of natural gas."
The bill amends the National Gas Act to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to set a refund effective date and order a refund when an interstate pipeline is found to be overcharging for its services.
FERC currently has these authorities under the Federal Power Act to order refunds from interstate electric utilities when they determine overcharges have been made.

Constituent Success Story           The district office in Durham received a request for help from a 95-year-old widow of a WWII Veteran for assistance with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
"For many years, this constituent had not received her benefits and the Durhamoffice staffwas determined to find a solution."
"After extensive research, many emails, calls and conversations, the district staff was able to identify the error and secured a back payment of $14,323 as well as a $979 a month pension for the rest of the constituent's life."
The constituent and her family expressed deep gratitude for the help of the Durham staff.

What a game; congratulations to our Super Bowl Champions.
The Presidents State of the Union address detailed the incredible accomplishments America has achieved in the last year.
Our middle class is booming and the unemployment rate is as low as its been in half a century.
"Seven million jobs have been created under his leadership, and in Missouri, real median household income is up eight percent."
"The economy continues to grow, lifting up working families and creating greater opportunities for the next generation."
"President Trump has said he would get to work for America, and he told us all how he has kept that promise."
"He has made it a priority to lower prescription drug costs, secure our border, and combat human trafficking."
"I will continue to work with him for our suburban families to advance critical initiatives such as passing paid parental leave legislation, addressing the skyrocketing costs of childcare, and ensuring our national security remains strong."
"Now that President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment, it is time Congress got back to the Peoples business of governing and build on his record of achievements for the American people."
Read my State of the Union press release here.
I introducedbipartisan legislation with my colleagues to help prevent repeated community flooding.
We must help regions at risk of repeat flooding become more resilient.
"By incentivizing communities to plan ahead for damaging floods, we can avoid continually subsidizing the rebuilding of flood-prone properties through the National Flood Insurance Program."
This bill aims to prevent loss of life and property and help communities withstand major floods like those we have recently experienced in Missouri.
Read more about the bill here.
Republicans introduced a privileged resolution to admonish the Speaker for ripping up the Presidents State of the Union address.
"Her action was a slap in the face to the President, the dignity of the House, and all of the Americans the President honored in his speech."
Democrats should allow us to vote on this legislation so they can go on record and tell the country whether they support such behavior or not.
"I had the honor of singing in the National Prayer Breakfast Congressional Choir with my colleagues.This is such a moving event, and I was blessed to attend."
It was great speaking to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) to discuss our work in Congress against human trafficking.
"Financial institutions are critical partners in the fight against trafficking, and I look forward to working with banks, non-profits, and law enforcement as we find new ways to identify traffickers and help victims find justice."
I was honored to receive an award from ACAMS for my work in the fight against trafficking and appreciate their support and partnership.
"The purpose of U.S. global health and economic development programming is to recognize, promote, and protect the dignity of all individuals, and to extend a helping hand so that the marginalized, poor, and vulnerable around the world may build a better future."
Abortion is not compatible with this mission.
"Children and families should not be enumerated as barriers to prosperity, but seen as sources of strength, beauty, purpose, meaning, and potential."
We will not make the challenge of ending poverty a little simpler in the short term by pushing women to end the lives of their children.
"Instead, we will continue to ensure that all women and children have access to healthcare, opportunity, and success."
"During our Foreign Affairs hearing on women and global health, I asked our witnesses how we can better help women have both their baby and their dreams."
"We also discussed how abortion is a key driver of gendercide, the global epidemic of violence against women and girls."
I had a great visit with kids from Step Up St. Louis and the Jefferson County Drug Prevention Coalition to talk about the many ways they are working to educate students on the many dangers of addiction and how they can identify the signs.

"                        The Webster Wire Listening to Floridians Dear Friends:  President Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday was a compelling ""Great American Comeback"" story."
"Our country is stronger today than it has been in years - our economy, our military, our families, our environment, and our communities are stronger."
This is thanks in large part to three years of an administration that has made it a point to get government off the backs of hardworking Americans and put America first.
"Americans across the county are experiencing a ""blue-collar boom."""
"We have historically low unemployment, and more Americans are working today than ever before."
"Industries like construction, healthcare are adding jobs at a robust pace."
"Labor participation and wages are rising, especially for the bottom 10 percent of earners."
More than 2.5 million Americans have risen out of poverty.
"In Florida, 630,000 more jobs have been created."
Florida homeownership is up 3 percentage points.
"Real, per-capita income is up 7 percent since the Presidents election."
"From appointing judges who know and respect the U.S. Constitution; to improving the VA and veteran services; to reducing tax burdens on small business owners and taxpayers; to streamlining and removing unnecessary red-tape that blocked infrastructure investments; to improving our trade agreements for American workers, manufacturers and builders; securing our borders; to and rebuilding our military  President Trump has kept his promises."
The President also spoke of the bipartisan success that has been achieved in Washington when Democrats quit playing politics and come to the negotiating table.
"Under President Trump's administration, including USMCA and a phase One trade deal with China."
"Another bipartisan achievement is the ""First Step Act,"" which allows inmates serving for drug-related crimes to receive a second chance."
"I hope my colleagues  Democrat and Republican alike  will put aside politics and work together to invest in our countrys infrastructure, improve border security and reduce and prioritize spending."
President Trumps address also included compelling stories of Americans coming from all walks of life.
"These guests lives illustrate his inspiring message that ""Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!"""
"(Video of Guests)  _______________  On Friday, the Department of Labor released the January jobs report."
"Employers added 225,000 jobs in the first month of 2020."
"Perhaps more importantly, wages have increased 3.1% from last year."
This report smashes expectations and continues to show that policies reducing regulations and lowering taxes is getting people across the country back into the workforce.
The U.S. economy is positioned to fuel more economic growth this year.
"______________ President Trump's message to terrorists has been clear, ""You will never escape American justice."
"If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life."""
"On Thursday, our military conducted a counterterrorism operation in Yemen that successfully killed Qasim al-Rimi, founder and leader of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and deputy to al-Qa'ida top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri."
al-Rimi joined the terrorist group in the 1990s and worked for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
"Under al-Rimi, AQAP committed countless attacks against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire attacks against the United States."
His death damages AQAP and the al-Qa'ida regime and brings the U.S. closer to eliminating the threats these terror groups pose to our national security.
"_______________  Each year, the U.S. Congress hosts the Congressional Art Competition."
This unique competition allows me to showcase the artistic talents of high school students within the 11thDistrict.
"The winning entries from each district are prominently displayed in the Cannon Tunnel to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C."
"The competition is open to high school students only, including home educated students."
"Each student may enter one piece of artwork that illustrates this years theme, the ""Wonders of Florida."""
"For guidelines, deadlines and more specific information, please visit my website."
(2019 Congressional Art Competition Winner)  _______________  Cindy Brown from my local office recently attended The Villages Giving Clubs Showcase.
"The purpose of this event is to showcase the many clubs, organizations, and groups that work to give back to our community, our region, and the world at large."
At least 36 clubs participated.
One of the clubs was Angel Snugs from the Villages.
"Jen Smith and Bonnie Mulneix - leaders of The Villages Angel Snugs club, showcased their mission to teach volunteers to knit, crochet and loom hats."
These items are then shipped to 80 pediatric hospitals around the country to help comfort children that have lost their hair due to chemotherapy cancer treatments.
"_______________  Last week, my District Director Christa Pearson participated in the First Annual Hernando Grown Student Conference."
She spoke to Hernando County high school students about their next steps in achieving their educational and career goals after high school.
Thank you and congratulations to all involved in a great inaugural event!
"Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress   Constituent Corner A member of the Florida Army National Guard stated that he never received the reenlistment signing bonus he had agreed to when renewing his contract in February 2019."
Our office inquired into the situation and learned that a recent backlog had been cleared and that the payment was scheduled to be applied to his retirement fund.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you.
District Update Pam Jones from my local office attended the American Heart Association Wear Red for Heart Health along with UF Health Leesburg Hospital.
Wear Red for Heart Health is the American Heart Associations yearly campaign to raise awareness for women to act against their number 1 killer  heart disease.
"Dr. Michelle Wood, who is an obstetriciangynecologist in Leesburg was the guest speaker and shared tips on heart health for women."
Legislative Update Last week the House passed H.R.
"2382, the USPS Fairness Act."
"This bill repeals a mandate from the 2006 passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which required the USPS to fully pre-fund future retiree health care benefits."
This requirement is unique to the USPS and has financially crippled the postal service.
"By removing this mandate, the USPS has the flexibility to use revenues to improve services and compete while still funding retirement benefits in a sustainable manner."
I am a strong supporter of the USPS and a co-sponsor of this bill.
This legislation now moves onto the U.S. Senate for consideration.

"Whether through tax reform, trade deals, deregulation, a secured border, a rebuilt military, or Americas energy revolution, the Presidents record of delivering real results for the American people cannot be denied."
"Now its time to put division aside, work with President Trump, and renew our focus on tackling unifying issues like infrastructure, education, and high prescription drug costs."
"In case you missed it, watchPresident Trumps address here."
"_____________________________________________________________  President Trump Acquitted   The Senate voted to acquit President Trump after a long, partisan process."
"Shortly before the vote, I went to the Senate Floor to give my closing remarks on the impeachment trial and to announce I would be voting to acquit the President."
The two articles which came before the Senate were without merit.
"They were an affront to the institution and to our Constitution, representing the very same partisan derangement that worried our Founding Fathers so much that they made the threshold for impeachment this high."
"I did not arrive at my conclusion to support acquittal hastily or flippantly, and I dont believe any of my colleagues did either, including those who come to a different conclusion from mine."
Watch my remarks below.
"_____________________________________________________________  Clarifying WPA Easement Directors Order  Robert Wallace, the U.S. Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks joined a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee oversight hearing in which we discussed the recent Directors Order on Waterfowl Production Area (WPA) Easements."
"I chair the EPW Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife and at the hearing, sought clarification on the process of implementing the Order, the expected timeline, the newly-established appeals process, and the future release of these maps."
The Directors Order addresses a longstanding and serious problem for many North Dakota landowners.
"The Order is the direct result of Interior Secretary David Bernhardts visit to Hope, North Dakota, last Octoberwhere he heard directly from landowners."
"The Order promises new maps overlaid on aerial imagery, detailing the boundaries and acreage of its easements to landowners, and provides the first-ever administrative appeals process for landowners who have FWS easements pre-dating 1976 on their property."
"I wrote a Letter to the Editor for the Minot Daily News, outlining what North Dakotans whose lands have these pre-1976 WPA easements should expect."
The success of this first-ever appeals process depends on public involvement.
_____________________________________________________________  USDA Issues Third Round of MFP Payments   The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the third and final tranche of 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments.
Im grateful to President Trump and Secretary Perdue for their continued support for American agriculture.
"These payments come at an important time for our producers, who face uncertainty in the Chinese market."
The Trump Administrations recognition of our producers as a target of unfair retaliation is noticed and appreciated.
_____________________________________________________________  Migratory Bird Treaty Act  President Trumps Administration released a proposed ruleto define the scope of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA).
"Under the Obama Administrations interpretation of the MBTA, anyone could be prosecuted without even making a deliberate effort to kill species protected by the MBTA."
"Had it not been stopped in court, this interpretation would have had severely negative consequences for North Dakotans."
The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee discussed the proposed rule during a Fish  Wildlife Service oversight hearing.
"In North Dakota, we had three oil companies zealously prosecuted by the U.S."
Attorneys office over 28 birds that inadvertently flew into the companys pits.
"These companies were lawfully practicing commercial activities and never intentionally sought to harm these birds, yet they were criminally prosecuted."
The previous US Attorneys actions against these companies and workers were more of a representation of their hatred of the industry than it was the love of birds.
The new proposal is common sense and I applaud the Trump Administrations efforts.Watch the exchange here.
"_____________________________________________________________  Discussing ISR and Space Force at SASC  During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the U.S. Southern Command Commander Adm. Craig Faller and U.S. Africa Command Commander Gen. Stephen Townsend came in to discuss their needs for the upcoming fiscal year."
"During this time, I addressed their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) needs like those provided by the MQ-9 in Fargo and the Global Hawks in Grand Forks."
Each Commander reported receiving 25 percent or less of the ISR capabilities they need.
I also inquired as to how the newly created U.S. Space Force could assist in their respective missions.
Our full exchange is below.
"_____________________________________________________________  Introducing Teleabortion Prevention Act I joined Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana to introduce the Teleabortion Prevention Act, which would make it a federal offense for healthcare providers to perform a chemical abortion without first physically examining the patient, being present during the chemical abortion, and scheduling a follow-up visit for the patient."
"Proponents of abortion say it should be a safe, rare decision made between a mother and a qualified doctor, but now there is a movement to provide abortions with little-to-no consultation with a physician."
"Killing an unborn child is wrong, and encouraging women to undergo that procedure without knowing the impact is egregious."
Our pro-life legislation counters these efforts and works to protect mothers and unborn children.
"_____________________________________________________________  North Dakotans in Washington, D.C."
It's always nice to see my friends from Grain Growers in Washington.
"We covered a wide range of topics affecting them, including RMA issues, WPA easements, MFP payments, wetland setbacks, and the Phase One trade deal with China."
Visiting with North Dakotas Tribal College students is one of my favorite meetings every year.
Im inspired by their stories and grateful for our time together.
"We discussed issues unique to tribal colleges including broadband, cultural education and degree programs."

"Concluding the Senate Impeachment Trial On Wednesday, the Senate Impeachment Trial concluded after votes on both Articles of Impeachment."
"Both articles failed to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove a President from office, with 48-52 and 47-53 votes respectively."
"When I took the oath at the beginning of this trial, I vowed to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law."
I took this oath and responsibility seriously and chose not to comment until I heard arguments from both the House managers and President Trumps lawyers.
"After hearing from both sides and asking multiple questions  , I voted no on conviction and removal of the president."
I came to this conclusion after three major considerations.
"First, in order to avoid a system of government where the president serves at the political pleasure of Congress, the Framers intended impeachment and removal to be reserved for extreme and rare situations."
The alleged facts contained in the articles and presented by the impeachment managers do not rise to this level.
"Second, the House failed in its prosecutorial role by not presenting specific statutory charges against the president."
Our Constitution demands of the justice system that prosecutors bring specific charges and prove each element of those charges beyond a reasonable doubt.
"In this case, neither of the articles passed by the House contain statutory allegations to which the Senate could determine whether the elements for conviction were met."
"On the floor, the House managers argued that the statutory crime of bribery was contained in the first Article of Impeachment related to abuse of power."
"In addition to the fact that there is no evidence in the record that satisfies the statutory elements of bribery, the Senate cannot substitute its own charges or charges made by House managers on the floor for those contained within the House-passed Articles of Impeachment."
"Third, the House failed to meet its evidentiary burden and attempted to shift that burden to the Senate."
"Unwilling to give the judicial system the time to answer important questions of executive privilege in regards to specific witnesses that the House managers claimed were key to the case, the House moved forward with impeachment."
The House managers argued at the beginning of the trial that they had overwhelming evidence supporting impeachment.
It was surprising then that the House managers attempted to burden the Senate with issuing subpoenas and taking testimony from those witnesses that the House failed to pursue.
"Regardless, additional evidence or witnesses would not change the material underlying facts describing the presidents actions."
"These actions are not high crimes and misdemeanors as described by the Constitution, and therefore, I voted no  on conviction and removal of the president."
"Supporting the Presidents State of the Union Priorities On Tuesday evening, President Trump delivered the State of the Union  , offering Congress and the American people the opportunity to hear directly from the President of the United States regarding his vision for Americas future."
"I was pleased the president discussed trade, our economy, STEM education, and support for our military and veterans."
President Trump highlighted accomplishments have hopefully made on establishing fairer trade with China and signing the historic United States Mexico-Canada Agreement.
New trade opportunities will help provide Kansas farmers and manufacturers with markets to sell their products around the world.
"As Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with President Trump to pass and implement policies that prioritize veterans and ensure they receive the care they deserve."
"I was honored to bring veteran and Kansas Representative Chris Croft to the State of the Union as my guest, and I appreciate the president hosting a number of veterans to the State of the Union as his guests to honor their service and the success they have achieved after service."
President Trump also conveyed his wish for Congress to fully fund NASAs Artemis program.
"As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science."
"I am committed to ensuring NASA has the necessary resources for our country to once again put Americans on the moon, furthering our national security and scientific priorities."
I look forward to working with President Trump and the administration on the many issues discussed to deliver positive results for Kansans and all Americans.
"Hosting Kansas Representative Chris Croft I invited  Kansas Representative Chris Croft, who represents the 8th district in Overland Park to the U.S. Capitol as my guest at the State of the Union."
He is both a veteran and an advocate for veterans in his role as a Kansas representative.
He served in the U.S. Army for 30 years and after retiring as a Colonel was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives.
"Rep. Croft is dedicated to his country, to Kansas and to our nations veterans, and I was honored to have him join me at the State of the Union as my guest."
"During his time in the Army, Rep. Croft served in Iraq and was selected as the executive director for the Center for Army Leadership at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas."
"In that role, he helped create the Armys first leader development manual and assisted U.S. allies around the world to establish their own leadership centers."
He received the distinction as the longest-serving director of the Armys Leadership Center.
"After retiring from the Army, Rep. Croft continued his service by running for the Kansas House of Representatives."
He was elected as the representative for the 8th district in 2018 and was selected to serve on the Veteran and Military Affairs Committee.
Croft is working to pass legislation to help establish a new home for veterans in northeast Kansas.
Thank you to Rep. Croft for joining me.
"Chairing a Hearing on the VA Community Care Network On Wednesday, I convened my first hearing  as Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee."
"The focus was providing oversight to the VAs efforts to implement the Community Care Network (CCN), a component of the VA MISSION Act."
This legislation directed the VA to create a network of community providers as an alternative for veterans when the VA is unable to provide timely or quality care.
"While we are still in the early stages of network deployment, the committee took the opportunity to have a discussion about the CCN with the VA, the companies responsible for building this network and other stakeholders."
"I shared my concerns regarding network adequacy and pushed the VA to use uniform access standards throughout the CCN, which will make it easier for veterans to receive community care."
The CCN will go live in Kansas next month and a robust network will be vital to guarantee our rural veterans receive timely healthcare.
"In my opening statement, I noted how Kansas Big First Congressional District is as large as the State of Illinois, but lacks a VA Medical Center."
"For veterans in rural areas, MISSIONs Community Care Network is essential for timely healthcare."
"As Chairman, I will continue to hold oversight hearings to make certain veterans are receiving the care and benefits they deserve."
Discussing Solutions to World Hunger and Development Issues I was pleased to join World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley and United States Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) leadership on Tuesday for a discussion about solutions to global hunger and development issues.
"As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus and member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture and State and Foreign Operations, hunger and development issues are some of my top priorities in the Senate."
"International food aid and development programs provide many benefits to Americans, including preventing violence and unrest overseas and markets for the commodities produced by Kansas farmers and ranchers."
"This discussion focused on solutions to these important problems, including what Congress should be focusing on in the future."
I look forward to continuing to work with my Senate colleagues on alleviating these global issues.
Pictured below is President and CEO of the U.S.
"Global Leadership Coalition Liz Schrayer, Executive Directory Beasley and Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.)."
"Speaking at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting On Tuesday, I was honored to speak at the Farm Credit Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C."
I spoke about trade and the challenges that farmers and ranchers have faced in Kansas and around the country.
"Due to disrupted trade markets, weather disasters, and low commodity prices, net farm income is down by 50 percent since 2013."
"The work of ag lenders is very important for farmers and ranchers in rural communities to have access to credit, in good times and bad."
I would like to thank Jeff Shipp for giving me the opportunity to speak at their meeting.
"Reacting to the CBOs Budget & Economic Outlook Report This week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030 Report  ."
"The report details projections on the rising levels of federal deficits, debts and spending in the decade to come."
The CBOs projections make clear the unsustainable fiscal path that the country finds itself on.
"Their analysis highlights the rapid expansion of mandatory spending programs in our government, projecting that these programs will account for 65 percent of total government spending by the end of the decade."
"With the growth of mandatory spending programs outpacing the growth of revenue, Congress has the responsibility to produce a plan that ensures future generations do not bear the burdens of harmful spending."
"As a member of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, & Science, I will work to ensure that the spending bills are fiscally responsible and do not threaten the economic growth and opportunity of our children and grandchildren."

"As you know, President Trump delivered his annual State of the Union address last week."
"I was proud to be joined by San Bernardino County Fire Chief Dan Munsey, whose presence served as a reminder of the importance of a strong working relationship between the federal government and our local agencies."
"San Bernardino County Fire Chief Daniel Munsey    Unfortunately, the president's speech was full of the same divisive rhetoric and falsehoods we've come to expect from one of his rallies."
You can read my full reaction to the State of the Union here.
One of the most important parts of my week was hosting a workshop for non-profits in our community to learn more about the 2020 Census.
"From the quality our children's schools, to the safety of the roads we drive on, the results of this year's census will have an enormous effect on our daily lives in the Inland Empire."
I hope that you'll help me spread the word throughout our community to make sure every San Bernardino County resident is counted.
Congressman Mark DeSaulnier (CA11) ?
"AT A GLANCE In this week's Digest, you will find more information on: * Our upcoming town hall; * Mark?s guest for the State of the Union; and * Mark?s work to support labor unions."
"TOWN HALL As Congress moves on after the impeachment trial ended, join us for a town hall on February 18th at Stanley Middle School as we discuss where we go from here."
This town hall will be a great opportunity to make your voice heard about what?s next.
"To RSVP, click the graphic below or call (925) 933-2660."
"SOTU & #SAVEISABEL Congressman DeSaulnier?s guest to President Trump?s State of the Union address was Isabel Bueso, a recipient of medical deferred action and a rare disease advocate."
"Last year, Isabel became the face of the Trump Administration?s cruel immigration policies when she and her family were told they had 33 days to leave the country, which would prevent Isabel from getting the life-saving medical care she needs."
The Congressman was honored to have Isabel as his guest to force the President and his allies to see that their actions impact real humans ?
and Isabel is one of them.
"Although Mark did not attend the address as he feels strongly that the President does not adhere to the rule of law and has little respect for our institutions, he is proud of Isabel?s courage and bravery."
"To learn more about Isabel?s remarkable story and the work Congressman DeSaulnier is doing in Congress to advocate for her and others in her position, click the video below."
"LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS Mark Leads Bill to Help Workers Join Labor Unions Labor unions help workers every day by providing better wages, safer workplaces, sick leave, and so much more."
"As a member of the Education & Labor Committee and a lifelong labor advocate, Mark was proud to be the Rules Committee Manager for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would help resolve many of the obstacles workers face to joining a union."
"To watch his comments,click on the video below."
"In the end, Mark voted in favor of this bill, which passed by a vote of 224-to-194."
"Congressman DeSaulnier Votes to Support Disaster Relief and Oppose Administration Efforts to Undermine Medicaid After the recent earthquakes struck and with the damage done by 2017 hurricanes, our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico need assistance now to rebuild infrastructure and protect public health."
Mark was proud to support the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief and Puerto Rico Disaster Tax Relief Act (H.R.
"5687), which passed by a vote of 237-to-161."
"Additionally, the Trump Administration has proposed gutting the Medicaid budget, potentially leaving millions without needed care."
Mark supported a resolution disapproving of this predatory and harmful move.
The resolution passed by a vote of 223-to-190.
"              -->               Dear friends and neighbors,  Last week, House Democrats passed the Protecting the Right To Organize (PRO) Act, a bold proposal that restores fairness to the economy by strengthening workers power to stand together and negotiate for higher wages, better benefits  safer working conditions."
"The Pro Act will work to create an economy that rewards hard-working Americans in several key ways:  Protecting the basic right to join a union Introducing meaningful, enforceable penalties for companies that violate workers rights Expanding workers collective bargaining rights and closing loopholes that corporations use to exploit workers Strengthening workers access to fair union elections and requiring corporations to respect the results    Heres what else Ive been up to:     Shedding Light on Puerto Rico Earthquakes         It was an honor to welcome Jessica Carrilloto the Capitol as my guest to the State of the Union."
She fled Gunica to our district as a result of Puerto Ricos devastating earthquakes.
"While President failed to mention Puerto Rico in his address, her message was still clear: its time President Trump end his personal vendetta against Puerto Rico and work with House Democrats to help the island rebuild."
"Helping Puerto Rico Recover and Rebuild         In recent weeks, thousands of families in Puerto Rico were forced from their homes, schools were flattened and roads and infrastructure were severely damaged as earthquakes rocked an island still struggling to recover from Hurricanes Maria and Irma."
"Today, Democrats and Republicans came together to deliver on our promise to help our fellow Americans get on a road to long-term recovery."
"The House passed an emergency supplemental that provides $4.89 billion in emergency spendingfor a broad range of disaster recovery activities, including educational needs, repairs to transportation infrastructure, community development, energy needs and nutrition assistance."
"Fighting for a Venezuela Libre         I had the privilege of meeting the legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaido."
My colleagues and I will continue to support his leadership and brave people of Venezuela.
"Together, we will do everything we can to fight for a Venezuela Libre!"
"Honoring Gun Violence Survivors         Gun Violence SurvivorsWeek is a time we say enough is enough and honor survivors by doing everything we can to make sure senseless tragedies, like the #Pulse nightclub shooting, never happen again."
"In doing so, we also recognize the brave heroes, like Terry DeCarlo, who do everything they can help survivors recover."
"Standing with my Brothers and Sisters in Labor    It was an honor to meet with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)to tell them about our historic Protecting the Right to Organize Act!"
"Honoring a Purple Heart Veteran           Mr. James W. Scroggins, a Korean War Veteran, is an American hero."
"During his time in service, he fought in Pusan, Korea  was wounded in battle."
It was an honor to present him with a Purple Heart for his great heroism  lifelong dedication to our country.
"Working with Local Mayors         I had a great meeting with Polk County Mayors this week to discuss rebuilding America with our Moving Forward framework, expanding high speed rail, improving postal service, ensuring everyone is counted in the upcoming census and expanding SunRail and high speed rail."
Looking forward to continuing our work for our constituents!
Meeting with Hispanic Leaders         I was proud to have had the chance to sit down with a number of community leaders this week to discuss the tragedy of the Puerto Rico earthquakes and the work weve been doing in Congress to secure a relief package and temporary housingassistance under FEMA for victims.
"We also discussed the 2020 Census, cruel Public Charge court ruling and our work for a free Venezuela."
Moving Forward with our Nations Infrastructure         The Trump Administration will try to convince you that the Moving Forward framework cannot be achieved.
My response at the Environment  Climate Change Subcommittee: yes we can and here is the proof that it can.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you in Congress!
"                                                Dear Friends,  Last week was a historic one in Washington."
"On Tuesday, the President delivered the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress."
I was disappointed that President Trump used a moment that should be an opportunity to unite the country behind a robust vision for the future to instead deliver a divisive campaign-style speech.
"The following day, the Senate failed to get the necessary 2/3 majority to convict President Trump, despite the clear evidence that President Trump compromised our national security for his own political personal gain and solicited foreign interference in our election."
It is deeply troubling to me that a majority of Senators refused to allow a full and fair trial by blocking admission witness and documents into the Senate proceedings.
I remain profoundly worried that this trial will set a precedent for future Presidents.
"Nevertheless, regardless of your views, the important thing now is that we move forward as a country."
"Throughout the impeachment process, the House has continued working on behalf of the American people."
"Last year the House passed more than 400 bills, including 275 with bipartisan support."
"That pace continues into 2020 and just last week we passed legislation to reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is critical to our local environment, as well as the PRO Act which strengthens workers right to organize."
"This week, we are expected to address legislation related to public lands and the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as hold a hearing on surprise medical billing in the Ways and Means Committee."
"At home over the weekend, we had a full house at our most recent Congress on Your Corner town hall in Winthrop Harbor."
I was also grateful for everyone who turned in Valentines to our office for local veterans  it was a privilege to distribute them over the weekend at a Lake County Honor Flight event and at Lovell Federal Health Care Center.
"HOLDING THE NRA ACCOUNTABLE  I am continuing to work to hold the NRA accountable for its potentially illegal abuse of our tax-exempt system, taking advantage of not just American taxpayers, but also misappropriating donations from NRA members."
"Last week, I released a report detailing detailing a pattern of misdeeds, including an egregious spending by NRA leaders, extensive self-dealing and conflicts of interest, and pervasive efforts to evade transparency."
I am again calling on the IRS to investigate these potential improprieties on behalf of the thousands of law-abiding non-profit organizations and hardworking taxpayers.
"INVITING VIETNAM VETERANS TO COMMEMORATION CEREMONY IN LAKE FOREST    I am honored to host another opportunity in Lake Foreston Saturday, February 29, 2020torecognize the veterans of the Vietnam War as part of the congressionally authorized United States of America Vietnam War Commemoration."

WEEKLY WRAP-UP   We had another wonderful #CongressonYourCorner town hall on Saturday in Winthrop Harbor.
"It was a standing room only gathering, and the wide-ranging conversation touched on high drug prices, protecting the Great Lakes, local flooding, bipartisanship, and more."
I want to extend a special thank you to Scout Troop 667 for presenting the colors and leading the pledge of allegiance.

"Last Thursday, I was honored to welcome Pastor Wade Stevenson to Washington last week as my guest to the National Prayer Breakfast in recognition of the important work done by Gideon Missionary Baptist Church in the Waukegan community."
I would encourage you to  who shared an important and timely message about overcoming our political polarization and replacing contempt with love.
It was great to meet last week with UAW Region 4.
They were visiting to talk about the PRO Act because our nations workers deserve a voice at the negotiating table.
"This legislation strengthens workers power to stand together and negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, and safer conditions."
The bill passed in the House on Thursday.
"As we discussed in last weeks newsletter, I was very excited to welcome North Chicago Community High School's Dr. David Brothman as my guest to the State of the Union address."
"We are certainly in the midst of historic times, and our public school teachers like David have the responsibility to educate and inspire our next generation of engaged citizens."
This picture was taken in my office just before heading to the House chamber.
"During Gun Violence Survivor Week, we remember the survivors of this horrible epidemic."
I spoke on the floor about why its time for Leader McConnell to do right by the countless survivors of gun violence and bring a vote on universal background checks (HR 8).
"Finally, I shared an update on my fight to restore the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction at the legislative breakfast of the Lake County Municipal League."
It was a great turnout for early on a Saturday morning.
"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                          February 9, 2020 The Senate impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump ended this week with an acquittal, leavingan indeliblestain on the legacy of our great Constitution."
"The President is a clear and present danger to our democracy and our national security interests, and yet he will remain in office despite committing high crimes and misdemeanors for which Senate Republicans admitted there was ample evidence."
"As we saw with the President's Friday night massacre, he has emerged from this dark chapter not chastened, but emboldened to commit even higher crimes."
"Trump cheated to win the 2016 election, hes cheating to try to win the 2020 election, and any rational person would expect more violations of our Constitution and the rule of law beforeElection Day this November."
"The House Managers presented incontrovertible proof that President Trump abused his power when he attempted to bribe an ally for dirt on a political rival and then worked to coverup his crimes, justifying his removal and disqualification from office."
"Nevertheless, Senate Republicans failed in their duty to be impartial jurors when they voted down the motion to seek additional witnesses and evidenceeven as new evidence emerged during the trial that tied the President personally to the Ukraine pressure scheme more than two months before he asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political opponents in the July 25 call."
Senate Republicans voted almost entirely along party lineswith an exceptional and courageous vote to convict from Republican Sen. Mitt Romneyto let the President off the hook.
"I pray for brighter days for our democracy, although I fear that we do not yet realize the grave damage wrought by this shameful abdication of duty by Senate Republicans."
"A sham trial cannot provide a legitimate acquittal, and so this will forever be an impeached President and the Members of the Senate who failed in their duty will be complicit with his crimes from this day forward."
"It was a truly dispiriting week in many respects, but there were also many high points that give me the conviction and hope to move forward."
That includes theHouse's unanimous passage of my bill to provide $25 million in federal funds each year for five years for the restoration of the San Francisco Bay.
I also had the honor of having Courtney Wild as my guest to this year's State of the Union (SOTU).
Courtney's courage inbreaking the silence on the abuse she suffered at the hands of sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein and her fight to ensurethat she and other survivors receive the justice they were initially denied inspired me to name one of my bills after her.
"I alsoproudly led the effort with my Democratic Women's Caucus co-chairs to wear suffragist white to this year's SOTU, in honor of the centennial of the 19th Amendment."
Our brilliant white outfits that stood out among a sea of dark suits sent a clear message to the President and the country that we will persist in our fight for true equality.
"There was far more that happened, as you will see below, and be sure to keep an eye out for the next DC Dashboard as we move onward and upward into 2020."
"As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District."

"Legislative Highlights Passed the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act in the House of Representatives On Wednesday, the House passed my bill, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act, by voice vote."
"Ive introduced this legislation every Congress since 2010, and the threat to our Bays health has only worsened."
"Climate change, pollution, and human activity have caused an alarming 90 percent of the Bays wetlands to be destroyed."
"The San Francisco Bay is not only a national treasure, but also home to over 100 types of endangered species."
It brings in $370 billion in goods and services annually and is home to over 3.5 million jobs.
"But between 2008 and 2016, the federal government invested a meager $45 million  far short of the $126 million in grant requests received by San Francisco Water Quality Improvement Fund (WQIF)."
"San Francisco Bay Restoration Act authorizes $25 million each year for five years to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fund water quality improvement projects, wetland and estuary restoration, endangered species recovery, and adaptation to climate change."
"We know that by 2030, the damage to our Bay will be irreversible."
This increased federal funding will go a long way toward saving our Bay for our communities today and for future generations.
"Voted to Table House Republicans Pathetic Attempt to Censor a Powerful Woman This week, House Republicans introduced a resolution disapproving of Speaker Nancy Pelosi for ripping her copy of President Trumps State of the Union remarks."
"The resolution claims that the Speakers action degraded the proceedings of the joint session, when it was clear to those watching that the State of the Union was degraded by the barrage of mistruths and bloviations the President performed during his game show of a speech."
This resolution is a blatant attempt to curry favor with a mercurial President who rewards sycophantic loyalty with political support.
I relished the opportunity to vote against such shameful pandering to Trumps ego and support a Speaker who refuses to be silent in the face of an existential threat to American democratic values and truth.
"Voted for Resolution Condemning the Trump Administrations Attacks on Medicaid On Thursday, I voted in favor of House Resolution 826, expressing disapproval of the Trump Administrations harmful actions towards the Medicaid program."
"In January, the Trump Administration announced a new waiver authority for states, laughably dubbed the Health Adult Opportunity program."
"This new authority provides anything but opportunity, as it would undermine crucial protections for some of the most vulnerable populations in our communities."
"The proposal would allow states to receive a waiver to block grant their Medicaid programs for adults in the expansion population, which translates to lower quality of care for fewer people."
"The Trump Administration argues that block grants would provide states more flexibility, but federal law already gives states significant flexibility  thats why the Medicaid program in Alaska looks vastly different than Medicaid in California."
This proposal is yet another attempt to weaken the Affordable Care Act and would come at the expense of millions of Americans and their health care.
"5687, to provide additional emergency aid to Puerto Rico On Thursday, I voted in favor of providing emergency supplemental aid to Puerto Rico."
"In the past several weeks, thousands of Puerto Ricans lost their homes after several large earthquakes rocked the island."
"Schools, roads, and infrastructure were destroyed, wiping out any progress since Hurricanes Maria and Irma."
5687 would provide an additional $4.67 billion for disaster relief and long-term recovery.
"President Trump has been dangerously slow in providing Puerto Rico with its federal disaster aid, and its clear that even more support and oversight is needed."
"Consequently, the emergency supplemental also includes accountability measures to address the Trump Administrations illegal withholding of Puerto Rico relief and includes several tax-related provisions that will support families and encourage economic growth."
The Senate and President must now move expediently to approve these funds so that our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico can recover and rebuild.
"Voted for the PRO Act to Protect the Basic Right to Join a Union and Collectively Bargain This week, I had the honor of voting for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act to protect workers rights."
"The PRO Act will safeguard our basic right to join a union by introducing meaningful penalties for companies and executives that violate workers rights, expanding workers collective bargaining rights and closing loopholes that corporations use to exploit workers and strengthening workers access to fair union elections and requiring corporations to respect the results."
The American economy is increasingly stacked in favor of large corporations at the expense of working families and the middle class.
"Over the last 40 years, average incomes for the bottom 90 percent of households increased 1.1 percent, while average incomes for the top 1 percent increased by more than 180 percent."
"This is wrong, and its in no small part due to the decimation of workers rights to join a union and collectively bargain."
Im proud to have voted for such pro-worker legislation and will continue to fight our nations skyrocketing income inequality.

"Chaired DWC HearingHonoring #MeToo Silence Breakers with Action This week, I had the honor of hosting a hearing with brave silence breakers and experts to highlight the cultural shift we have seen with the #MeToo movement, the progress made, and the changes and legislation still needed to prevent and address workplace harassment."
"Our distinguished speakers included Drew Dixon, who is featured in the On the Record documentary about her sexual violence allegations against Russell Simmons; Kim Lawson, a McDonalds worker and Fight for $15 leader; Liz Giorgi, the CEO of Soona; Gillian Thomas, Senior Staff Attorney at the ACLU Womens Rights Project; and EEOC Commissioner Charlotte Burrows."
Kim shared a heartbreaking story of having to move around shifts so she didnt have to workhere.
"Chaired MILPERS Hearing on Exceptional Family Member Program On Tuesday, the House Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing on the problems with the militarys Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP)."
"EFMP is supposed to help special needs families with military assignments, educational resources, and medical care, but too often falls far short of families needs."
As a nation we have a duty to ensure that our military families have access to the medical and educational resources that their children need.
"The testimony of military parents and advocates highlighted ways the Department of Defense (DOD) is failing these families, despite the availability of solutions."
The DOD must treat this issue with more urgency.
Parents focused on finding appropriate care for their kids will be less focused on their jobs.
"And if we make them choose between their families and jobs, they will rightly choose their families."
I will continue to keep up my vigilant oversightof this problem to ensure that the DOD quickly adopts the changes necessary to bring these programs up to standard.
"Roundtable Discussion on Access to Shelter and Housing for Domestic and Sexual Violence Survivors As Co-Chair of the Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I led a roundtable discussion with experts on the critical need for shelters and affordable housing for domestic and sexual violence survivors."
Domestic violence (DV) survivors are four times as likely to become homeless and 84 percent of survivors report needing assistance with housing.
The federal government has been woefully behind in developing policies that support survivors and their ability to regain independence after escaping an abusive relationship.
"Likewise, there remains a nationwide shortage of shelters specifically for domestic violence victims."
"Fifty percent of DV survivors report feeling unsafe in a standard homeless shelter  these shelters may not protect their identities or location, risking survivors ability to remain safe from their abusers."
"While community education and resources for survivors has incrementally improved over the years, domestic violence remains a pervasive epidemic that consistently fails to receive the funding and attention it merits."
"In 2019, one in six homicides in New York were determined to be a result of domestic violence."
This is unacceptable.
We must reform our shelter systems and affordable housing opportunities to properly address the needs of survivors  lives are on the line.
Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives of BOMA from San Francisco  One of the bestparts of my job is meeting with peoplefrom my district to hear about their ideas and to share with them the latest information on Capitol Hill.
I hold meetings in both my DC and San Mateo offices and travel back home to the 14th District every weekend.
I strongly believe that Members of Congress must maintain an open dialogue and keep in constant contact with individuals outside of theBeltwayin order to more effectively represent the interests of their districts and communities.
"Voices of Californias 14th District Each week, hundreds of my constituents reach out to my San Mateo and Washington, D.C. offices to express their concerns and support for issues and receive information about legislation and policies."
Every constituent who writes in receives a personal response.
Here are some issues constituents raised this week:  103 constituents expressed support for H.R.
"2214, the NO BAN Act."
"I am a cosponsor of this important legislation that would prohibit religious discrimination in various immigration-related decisions, limit the Presidents authority to restrict individuals from entering the United States, require specific evidence of a need for the restriction, and mandate that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consult Congress before imposing such a restriction and report to Congress periodically after its imposition."
99 constituents shared support for conserving endangered species.
I agree that we must ensure that endangered species are cherished and protected.
"While we have made great strides in protecting wildlife, recent efforts to derail the Endangered Species Act are part of a greater trend of politically-motivated assault on science in our country."
You have my word that I will fight against these efforts and work to safeguard our wildlife conservation laws.
38 constituents expressed support for asylum seekers on the border.
We have a vital responsibility to protect immigrants against abuses of authority.
"       News from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                          February 9, 2020     Dear Friend,  In last weeks State of the Union address, President Trump outlined the many accomplishments that have been secured during the past three years."
"I am proud of these results, particularly as it relates to our thriving economy and how it is working to the benefit all Americans."
"I was disheartened by the behavior of some of my colleagues, which I found to be a stain on the rich history of our institution and a poor example for our children."
What unites us as Americans is greater than our division and we must work together in a civil manner to find common ground.
"Additionally, last week the Senate finally brought to a close a partisan, politically-motivated charade."
"There are many important issues facing our country, and the time for putting this distraction behind us is long overdue."
I will continue to work with my colleagues to build consensus on the issues that matter most to our community and that will improve the lives of those I serve.
Strengthening our Economy  Last weeks State of the Union address highlighted our great economic success story.
Here are just a few examples in Florida.
The most recent Jobs Report contains more good news about the strength of the American economy.
"More than 225,000 jobs were added in January and the jobless rate was 3.6%."
"Additionally, wages are up 3.1% when compared to last January."
"For the past 18 consecutive months, average pay has grown at an annual pace of 3% or higher."
We must continue to support pro-growth policies.
"Last week, I voted against the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act because it is exactly the kind of legislation that would cripple our economy."
"While it may sound well intentioned, its impact would be devastating."
We currently have a record low unemployment rate because we have created a climate that allows small businesses to thrive.
Small businesses are the backbone of our nations economy.
"When they are free to innovate and compete in the free market, jobs are created and wages rise."
"Additionally, it was an honor to be recognized last week by the U.S. Travel Association for my work to reauthorize the Brand USA program."
This public-private partnership has a solid record of attracting international tourists to the U.S. without costing the taxpayers a dime.
"Given that tourism is so important to the state of Florida's economy, passage of my bill was a priority."
Fighting for our Heroes  I'm continuing to work in a bipartisan manner to improve Veterans' access to benefits and ensure resources are used as efficiently as possible in order to meet the needs of our nation's heroes.
This article outlines a bill I co-authored last week to help accomplish this goal.
In last weeks VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Hearing we discussed a variety of draft bills to help improve educational opportunities for Veterans.
Click here to listen to my remarks during the hearing.
"Last week, a bill I cosponsored passed the House."
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act creates a pilot program within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help combat Veterans address mental health issues by pairing them with dogs to train as service animals.
The bill directs the VA to provide grants to nonprofits that teach Veterans to train service dogs.
"Upon completion of the program, Veterans can, if they wish, adopt their dogs for ongoing therapy."
This is one small part of the work Ive been doing to help Veterans gain access to alternative and complementary therapies.
One size does not fit all when it comes to an issue as sensitive as addressing the mental health needs of our nations heroes and they deserve access to every type of treatment that has proven effective.
"Additionally, several constituents have called my office recently asking for an update on the Zephyrhills VA Clinic."
"I received the following update from the VA Leadership Team:  ""The design phase took longer than anticipated due to strict VA guidelines for clinic construction, but the builder was able to make up some time and we are on track for clinic construction completion by the end of 2020 and full clinic activation in fall 2021."
"Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs  I was glad to hear the President call for bipartisan solutions for lowering prescription drug prices, something that has been a priority for me."
HR 19 has over 40 provisions that have widespread bipartisan support.
Lets bring that bill to the Floor immediately.
Protecting Public Health   Fentanyl analogues are extremely dangerous and have been proven to be deadly for many Americans.
"While the Speaker waited until the deadline to extend this critical ban, I am glad the President was finally able to sign legislation that maintains the strictest safeguards to protect against abuse of this highly potent narcotic."
The current outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has dominated news headlines.
"As I mentioned last week, it is important to remain calm."
"The virus originated in China but has now spread internationally, impacting an increasing number of countries."
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is taking the necessary precautions to protect the American public.
"However, the CDC always recommends everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including the following tips:   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing."
"If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
"Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands."
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
"Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash."
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Visit the CDC website to learn more about prevention strategies.
Improving Transparency  We have been calling on FEMA to approve the updated flood maps for several years.
Im glad to see they will be implemented in just a few months because homeowners deserve an accurate and transparent process.
Praying for the Future of Our Nation  It was an honor to attend last week's National Prayer Breakfast.
My prayer is that the leaders of our great nation will come together in unity to solve the problems that impact the daily lives of those we serve.
"I ask God to give leaders at all levels the humility, strength and grace to rise above division and prioritize the needs of our citizens."
Raising Awareness  Black History month allows us the opportunity to celebrate all of the unique contributions that African Americans have made to strengthen our nation.
"February is also American Heart Month, a perfect time to learn how to prevent heart disease and keep #OurHearts healthy."
"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women, but is largely preventable."
"The most common type of heart disease affects 1,441,000 people in Florida."

Constituent Corner  Last week I received a call from a constituent in Holiday who thanked me for helping her father solve a problem with incorrect Social Security payments.
They had been working with the Social Security Administration for more than 5 months.
"After calling my office, his problem was resolved within one week."
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
"During last week's economic development meeting hosted by the North Tampa Bay Chamber, my team received an update from the Department of Transportation on current and anticipated transportation projects."
Increased congestion is a major concern for all us who call the Tampa Bay area home.
It is important that we continue to tackle the problem and develop solutions on a regional basis.
"Last weekend, my team had the chance to speak to the Pasco County Housing Authority's Family Self Sufficiency Graduating Class."
This wonderful program empowers families who want to transition from public housing to home ownership.
"Their stories are truly inspiring, and I wish them great success as they embrace the American dream."
"Additionally, my team had the privilege of judging the Pasco County Science and Engineering Showcase."
It is great to see students being exposed to a challenging STEM curriculum that encourages scientific discovery.
These young students certainly have a bright future ahead.
Thank you for reading this weeks update.

" News from Representative Fulcher                            February 9, 2020    DearLindsey Cormack,  It was a full week in Washington, D.C. with the President's acquittal, the State of the Union, the National Prayer Breakfast, and some major votes.I am thankful to be spending time back in Idaho this weekend, seeing many of you and hearing your thoughts on these issues."
"The historic ""impeachment in search of a crime"" is over... for now."
"I just started my second year as a member of the U.S. Congress, and impeachment efforts have preoccupied the House leadership agenda every day that I have served."
"To put it more bluntly, Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and other democratic leaders have allowed their vitriol toward President Trump to override the interests of our entire Nation."
"As a result, this Congress has accomplished very little in terms of constructive policy and the level of political polarization is staggering."
"The vast majority of democrats have made themselves unavailable to any constructive policy dialogue, as they are completely absorbed by their impeachment agenda."
"Now that the Senate has acquitted the President, I ask the Speaker and my colleagues across the aisle to put history in the rear-view mirror."
Let's fulfill our responsibilities and go to work for the American people.
"On Thursday, theHousevoted on a bill called ""The Pro Act""."
"Ivoted no, just as I did in the Education and Labor Committee."
"If the Pro Act were to become law, it would mandate workers to pay union dues, subject personal information to organized labor institutions, and eliminate the right to a secret ballot."
"The bill would overturn Idaho's longstanding ""Right To Work"" law and replace it with federal labor mandates."
It would also re-structure corporate franchise rules so drastically that franchises could cease to exist in Idaho.
"In terms of potential impact on Idaho, ""The Pro Act"" would be more appropriately deemed ""The Con Act""."

In The News I stopped by to chat with KTVB following President Trump's State of the Union Address on Tuesday.
    NewsFrom Congressman Ben Cline                    Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline  The Senate's acquittal of President Trump and the State of the Union grabbed most of the headlines this week.
I was proud to stand in defense of citizens' right-to-work and opposed legislation seeking to force people to join a labor union to get or keep a job.
It was also a pleasure to have so many different groups from across the Sixth District join me in Washington this week to advocate for the issues they care most about.
"With impeachment officially behind us, I am hopeful Congress can move past partisanship and spend the next year working for the American people."
"President Acquitted:  From the beginning, Speaker Pelosi said that impeachment must be compelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan."
"However, the impeachment of President Trump did not possess any of these qualities."
"The flawed and rushed process conducted in the House, coupled with the lack of evidence required to prove high crimes and misdemeanors, made the acquittal of President Trump by the Senate appropriate and necessary."
"The impeachment process in the House was a sham, and it set a dangerous precedent that we must reject moving forward."
Never again can we allow one political party to use impeachment as a tool for political gain.
This entire process has been little more than an attempt by Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election and the will of 63 million Americans  all while denying the President his right to due process.
"The partisanship displayed by some of my colleagues has fueled the rancor and division within this country, and this entire display of political theater will forever be remembered as a sad stain on the House of Representatives."
"After wasting months focusing on impeachment, I am hopeful that Congress can now get back to work on issues important to the American people, including improving our Nations infrastructure and highways, supporting our military and veterans programs, securing our border and preventing the flood of drugs and human trafficking that has flowed across it, and finding solutions to bring down the costs of health insurance and prescription drugs."
"State of the Union: After an eventful few months, President Trump gave his annual address to a joint session of Congress this week."
He delivered a message that Americans already knew - that the state of our union is strong.
"Throughout his speech, he laid out a forward-looking and optimistic agenda that will lead to the continued prosperity of this Nation."
"Over the course of the last three years, President Trump and his Administration have accomplished a great deal for the American people."
"Above all, President Trump's commitment to cutting bureaucratic red-tape has allowed businesses to thrive and the economy to flourish."
"Since his swearing in, the United States has added more than 7 million new jobs and a record 160 million people are currently in the workforce."
"Many of these new jobs have been in the manufacturing sector - a result of more than 12,000 factories opening their doors throughout the President's term."
"Further, unemployment currently stands at or near-fifty-year lows, including record lows among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Women, and Veterans."
"The President's landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created opportunity zones to encourage investment in low-income areas, which have lifted nearly 2.5 million Americans out of poverty and risen the median wage for middle-class families by $5,000 a year."
These economic victories can also be seen right here in Virginia.
"Our Commonwealth's unemployment rate stands at 2.6 percent - a result of the 120,000 new jobs created in the state since President Trump took office.Unemployment insurance claims are down 22 percent since his election andreal median household income in Virginia is up 12 percent."
"The 212 opportunity zones designated in our state havelifted 137,000 Virginians out of poverty and have inspired hope in our struggling communities."
"While the economic success our Nation has seen during this Administration is immense, President Trump has secured countless other victories for our country."
"Not only has he signed new trade deals like USMCA and the Phase One agreement with China, but he has also made significant progress in securing our border, passed historic criminal justice reform legislation, stood for pro-life values, enhanced vocational education, strengthened our military, and taken out numerous terrorists abroad ensuring the safety and security of our Nation."
Protecting the Right to Organize Act:  This country was founded so that all Americans could have the opportunity to succeed.
"One way that we promote this is through policies and laws that allow people the right to work, which in turn makes us more competitive in the business market."
"Thankfully, our Commonwealth is a right-to-work state."
"And because of this, Virginia was once again ranked as the number one state in which to do business in 2019 by CNBC."
"2474, which passed the House this week, would inappropriately preempt and prohibit right-to-work laws in 27 states that value and protect this fundamental right."
This is unacceptable.
"In an even further affront to liberty, this bill abhorrently violates the privacy of workers by forcing them to share their personal contact information with union organizers, even when this has been shown to enable harassment and intimidation of those very workers."
"If signed into law, this bill would have grave impacts on workers and businesses at great cost to the fabric of our workforce."
Every American deserves the right to create their own success from their own volition  free of the requirement that they join an organization solely to hold a job.
"Simply put, as our Founding Father and fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson said, To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical."
I voted against this bill to protect Virginia workers and stand for the freedom and success in which our Founding Fathers believed.
"Sixth District in DC:  It is truly always a pleasure to host Sixth District residents in Washington, D.C.        Rep. Cline Meets with members of the VA Farm Credit          Rep.

" News from Representative Casten                                        February 7, 2020Dear Lindsey,  The new year is in full swing and I have been working hard on behalf of the residents of Illinois Sixth District."
"In January, I introduced a bill to help combat greenhouse gas emissions in our power sector, sent a letter to Betsy DeVos to urge the U.S. Department of Education to issue federal guidance banning public schools dangerous use of seclusion and restraint practices, honored Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a commemorative video, and held my first town hall of 2020  my 23rd since taking office and this Saturday Ill be holding a Town Hall in Algonquin."
"If youre interested in attending, RSVP here: Rep. Casten Introduces the Energy PRICE Act to Ensure FERC is Doing Their Part to Fight Climate Change    To learn more about my Energy PRICE Act, click here."
"I recently introduced the Energy PRICE Act, which would clarify that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the responsibility to ensure that public electric utilities take into account greenhouse gas emissions when setting their utility rates."
"This bill serves a critical and necessary function to remind FERC that they have an affirmative obligation to structure rules and markets to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders  consumers, investors, and the environment  are met."
"We cannot get to a zero-carbon economy under the current regulatory regime, and this bill is a critical and necessary step to achieve that goal."
"Rep. Casten Urges Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to Ban Harmful Student Seclusion, Restraint Practices   To read my full letter to Secretary DeVos, click here."
"When the Chicago Tribune released an investigative report on the horrific use of child seclusion and life-threatening restraints in schools, which are disproportionately used against children with disabilities, I knew these practices needed to end immediately."
"Thats why I led a letter, along with Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Tammy Duckworth, my Illinois House colleagues, and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley to the U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos demanding she issue guidance to end this practice that is endangering our children."
The fact that only 5 states have acted to stop these practices is reprehensible.
Every child should feel safe at school.
I hope that Secretary DeVos will do the right thing and act quickly to ban these practices nationwide.
"Rep. Casten Honors Dr. Martin Luther King with Commemorative Video    To watch my video in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., click the image above or click here."
"This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I was proud to honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr  a man who dedicated his life to equality, to peace and to service."
I am personally in awe of Dr. Kings wisdom and patience.
"The wisdom to recognize the power of non-violent protest, and the patience to maintain that strategy even as his friends and colleagues were being bludgeoned."
Dr. King did not ask us to simply believe that the future would be better.
He asked us to play an active role in the creation of that better tomorrow.
I hope we all take his example as a call to our service not only on Martin Luther King Jr. Day but every day.
"Rep. Casten Visits Local Metra Facility to Show Support For Cleaner, Better Public Transit    Recently, I stopped by Metra's facilities to learn about their work rehabilitating locomotives and railcars."
"In the past decade, they have successfully revitalized 214 passenger cars, extending their life by 10-14 years."
It is great to see innovation that is both cost effective and reduces waste.
It is my honor to represent you in the 116th Congress.
"As your Representative, I work for you and want to hear your priorities and concerns."

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES  ?????????
17th DISTRICT  ?????????
"CONTACT ME  Dear Friend: Here are some of the ways in which I?m fighting hard to keep Lower Hudson Valley communities safe, healthy, and secure: * Fighting President Trump?s Global Gag Rule * Discussing E-Cigarettes with FDA Commissioner * Receiving CADCA Lifetime Achievement Award * Obtaining Medication for a Westchester Resident Fighting President Trump's Global Gag Rule  I testified  before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on President Trump?s Global Gag Rule, a dangerous policy originally aimed at cutting U.S. international family planning funds that the Trump Administration expanded to restrict all global health funding, affecting approximately $8.8 billion in U.S. assistance."
"1055, the Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights (HER) Act, which would permanently end this policy once and for all."
"* Passing this legislation would restore our country?s role as an international leader and ensure that women, men, and children around the world are able to access the health care they need."
Discussing E-Cigarettes with FDA Commissioner ???????
"This week, I met with Dr. Stephen Hahn, the new FDA Commissioner."
"* Dr. Hahn and I discussed the sale of new disposable e-cigarettes, and I urged him to take these products off the market."
"* Our children deserve better, and I will continue to fight to protect their health and safety."
Receiving CADCA Lifetime Achievement Award ???????
I was honored to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA).
"* CADCA members have fought tirelessly to make a difference in this country, and I commend CADCA for the work it has done in the Lower Hudson Valley."
"* I have valued my relationship with CADCA since before becoming a Member of Congress, and I will continue to work with them to prevent substance misuse and promote healthy, drug-free communities."
"Obtaining Medication for a Westchester Resident A White Plains man contacted me because his doctor prescribed a medication vital to his health, but he was denied insurance coverage by a mail-order pharmacy."
* I contacted the pharmacy and was told this was because there was no prior approval from the doctor on record.
"* The pharmacy contacted the doctor, obtained the approval, and the claim was paid soon after."

"Good News From the FCC For rural areas such as ours, safe and reliable methods of telecommunications are vital."
"We count on them to stay connected with each other, foster new economic opportunities, and engage with the wider world."
"In the House of Representatives, where I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over telecommunications, I fight to make sure communities such as ours are properly served."
The agency charged with carrying out the telecommunications laws passed by Congress is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
"It regulates radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable communications in the United States."
"In recent weeks, it has taken several encouraging steps that will contribute to expanded and improved telecommunications services in the Ninth Congressional District of Virginia."
"Broadband Broadband Internet service is indispensable for job creation, education, and various other activities in the modern world, but many sparsely populated communities are not connected."
"Closing the digital divide between rural and urban areas is a necessity, and to help achieve this goal, the FCC at its January 30 meeting established the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund."
Its goal is to direct $20.4 billion over the next ten years to building fast broadband networks in unserved rural areas.
"The first phase of this plan will begin later this year, with $16 billion in funding going to areas that are not served at all."
"Virginia has an estimated 217,000 home and business locations that would be eligible for Phase I of the funding."
"Subsequently, $4.4 billion will be made available to support areas that enjoy partial service."
This planned investment by the FCC marks a significant commitment to addressing the needs of rural areas.
"Still better, more good news on broadband may be on the way."
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has announced a plan for new rules around television white spaces to be considered at the commissions February meeting.
TV white spaces are unused spectrum between stations.
"They can be adapted for other purposes, including providing broadband services in rural areas."
"Chairman Pais plan would change the FCCs rules on white spaces, enhancing the ability of innovators to use them for broadband delivery."
More investment and greater flexibility to use white spaces will help connect rural areas.
What are some of the possible benefits?
More appeal to businesses and job creators to locate here.
Greater availability to educational resources.
Aid to farmers via precision agriculture.
"I will note in particular one benefit: increased use of telehealth, which can make it easier for patients to check in with their health care providers and thus support better outcomes."
"I have championed telehealth as a health care solution in our area, and the FCC last year even made the announcement in Carroll County of its plans for a $100 million Connected Care Pilot Program."
Better broadband access will also serve the purpose of expanding telehealths reach.
"The FCC under Chairman Pai has shown a true commitment to closing the digital divide, and I applaud their efforts."
"Robocalls In contrast to broadband, where the problem is a lack of access, the problem with our telephones lately is that they are being abused by illegal robocalls."
This was a problem that received bipartisan attention in Congress and in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
"We passed the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act last year, and President Trump signed it into law."
The FCC is one of the agencies charged with executing this law.
It has urged phone companies to allow tracing of robocalls from foreign sources and moved toward selecting an entity to lead efforts in the private sector to trace illegal robocalls.
"The U.S. Department of Justice, which also has responsibility to enforce the TRACED Act, filed actions against entities facilitating illegal robocalls."
These actions are important.
"Although passage of the TRACED Act was a significant achievement against illegal robocalls, it will not get rid of them overnight."
Success will depend on enforcement.
I am glad to see federal agencies taking steps to carry out the law.
"If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office."
"       WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS  On February 4th, Congress gathered to hear President Trumps third State of the Union address."
"This year, we need to make progress on top priority issues for Americans like the opioid epidemic, criminal justice reform, and mental health care."
"As your representative, I will keep working to get things done for Marylanders."
"Heres what I focused on last week:  Last Monday, I paid tribute to Holocaust Remembrance Day on the House floor and mourned the six million Jews that were murdered in this genocide."
This year also marks 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.
"There alone, 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed."
Holocaust Remembrance Day serves as reminder of what depravity humans are capable of when we dont make it a priority to end intolerance.
"Today and every day, we must continue the fight against hatred."
"Last Wednesday, I presided over the House floor during the debate on a bill that would temporarily ban fentanyl analogs."
"In 2018, synthetic substances like fentanyl were involved in approximately  of all opioid overdose deaths."
Were fighting to keep these dangerous drugs off of the streets.
"Later in the day, I was proud to help the House pass this bill."
"Now, I am calling on the President to sign it into law and keep vulnerable Americans safe."
"The following day, the Maryland Legislature voted to override Governor Hogans veto of Delegate Nick Mosbys ban the box legislation."
The legislation would prevent employers from requiring an applicant to disclose whether they have a criminal record before their first in-person interview.
"All too often, returning citizens are passed up for jobs because of their backgrounds."
Recent studies indicate that between 60 and 75 percent of the formerly incarcerated remain unemployed up to a year after their release.
This just isnt right.
Banning the box in Maryland is a victory for our state and for the hardworking returning citizens that are building better lives for themselves and their families.
"Rep. Trone visits Carmens Corner Store, a business in Hagerstown run by Mark Wilks, a returning citizen."
"EVENTS  On Tuesday, my office put on a Seniors Workshop in Hagerstown."
"I had a wonderful afternoon talking to constituents and hearing from experts about how to navigate some of the biggest issues our seniors are facing today, like skyrocketing prescription drug costs."
Ill keep fighting so that no Maryland is forced to empty their bank account to fulfill their basic needs.
Thank you for a great and informative afternoon!
"SHAREABLE  Dont forget to follow my official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram pages to stay in touch."
"TEAM TRONE  As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I know that high-quality education starts with high-quality teachers."
I was happy to meet Montgomery County Teacher of the Year Maddy Hanington.
"During her time with Montgomery County, Maddy has inspired her students to work hard and dream big."
Thank you for all that you do!
My district office staff is available to provide assistance with federal agencies.
"If you are experiencing problems with federal services such as Medicare or veterans' benefits, please contact the office at (301) 926-0300."
We will work hard to ensure that your problem is resolved.
"Sincerely,  David TroneMember of Congress             Please do not reply to this email."
"           Visit My Website Get Help with Federal Agencies  Read My Latest News   Email Me Visit Washington  Follow Me:              Weekly Update from U.S. Representative Mike Levin  Responded to President Trump's State of the Union Address  I hosted Dr. Pat Davis, of Encinitas, as my guest for the State of the Union."
"The Presidents address fell short on many pressing issues, particularly his disingenuous rhetoric on protections for pre-existing conditions, which he is working to destroy in court."
"He was also out of touch on the economy, as working families are still struggling to afford their prescriptions, mortgages, and student loans."
"The President should recognize that the GOP tax bill has not delivered the prosperity that was promised for the middle class, and he must work with Congress to address Americas slowing growth and soaring debt."
"It is also disappointing that the President failed to acknowledge the destructive impact that climate change is having on our country, including coastal erosion that threatens people and property in coastal communities I represent."
I was also hoping for a greater emphasis on Americas veterans and the bipartisan work we must continue to do so that no one who has served our country goes homeless or hungry.
"While the President continues to attack California, Ill continue to work across the aisle to get results on these issues for North County San Diego and South Orange County."
"Introduced a Bipartisan Bill to Improve Veterans' Access to Education Benefits  This week, I introduced theStreamlining GI Bill Processing Actto improve access to GI Bill benefits for veterans."
"The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide veterans with an electronic copy of their Certificate of Eligibility for GI Bill benefits, which schools require veterans to provide."
"Currently, veterans are only provided with a hard copy in the mail upon request, which slows the verification process and creates an unnecessary burden for student veterans."
This bipartisan bill is a commonsense step we can take to make life easier for student veterans.
"It may seem like a small step, but providing veterans with an electronic copy of their GI Bill eligibility certificate will help countless veterans receive the higher education benefits they have earned and deserve."
"Responded to the Senate Vote on Impeachment  Lastly, I want to take a moment to express my disappointment in the Senate for failing to conduct a fair trial of the president, including witnesses and documents."
"While Senators of both parties acknowledged the evidence and voted to convict and remove the President, the American people must now decide if his conduct is worthy of the office."
I will continue to do everything I can to fight corruption and hold this White House accountable.
"That being said, my first obligation is and always will be to deliver results for our district, working across the aisle whenever possible."
"Other highlights:   On Wednesday, I helped to launchthe Military Transition Assistance Pathway Caucus."
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the caucus to further improve transition resources for our servicemembers and veterans.
A quick reminder that our Valentines for Veterans program is still in full swing.
"Dont forget to have your submissions to my district offices by next Wednesday,February 12.I encourage constituents of all ages to participate and help us say thank you to our local veterans this upcoming Valentines Day."
"  News fromCongressman Steve Cohen                             Website  Serving You  Legislative Work  Our District  Resources               February 7, 2020      Dear Friend,This week, Iboycotted the impeached Presidents State of the Union address because I dont believe he is worthy of the dignity and respect accorded to his predecessors."
I also expressed disappointment at the Presidents acquittal by the Senate while noting that a bipartisan majority of the Congress has voted either to impeach or convict him; commemorated Black History Month; questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray about hate crimes and the rise of right-wing extremists; presided at a hearing on the impact on our nations democracy of the Supreme Courts Citizens United ruling ten years ago; supported passage ofthe PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act; received the Tennessee Alzheimer Leader Award;wrote to the President and spoke on the House floor about the lack of diversity in Trump Administration appointments; announced significant grants to St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center; and offered a health tip.
"Keep reading to learn more about my week and follow me onTwitter,Facebookand Instagramto see more updates as they happen."

"I knew that it would be, as Speaker Pelosi later said it was, a manifesto of mistruths.I was frankly offended at the carnival barker-reality show quality of the speech after listening through the years to stirring oratory and lofty ideas from past Presidents."
Not attending sent the right message: the current President isnt worthy to address Congress from that iconic podium.
"See a release about my decision here.Expressing Disappointment at Trumps Acquittal on Impeachment Charges I wasdisappointed, but not surprised,at the Senate acquittal of the President on Wednesday.However,more than half the Congress has now voted either to impeach or convicthim and hisimpeachment and abuses of power will always stain his presidency.I admire Senator Mitt Romney for being the one Republican senator willing to honor his oath and vote to convict."
"See my release on the acquittal here.Commemorating Black History Month    February is Black History Month, and its a pleasure to consider Memphis' rich history of African American pioneers in almost every field of human endeavor."
"See my release about recognizing heroes from the arts, music, sports and other fields here."
Thismorning I went to the Library of Congress to commemorate Black History month and have a breakfast with Featherlight pancakes made from Rosa Parks own recipe.
The Library of Congress is featuring Black History month on its website.
"See that here.Questioning FBI Director Wray about Hate Crimes   As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee,I questionedFBIDirector Christopher Wrayat an oversight hearingon Wednesdayabout hate crimes and the increase in white nationalists and right-wing extremists."
I also asked him about the 1955 Emmett Till lynching and whether cold cases from that era are being re-opened.
See my release about the hearing and my exchange with Wray here.Chairing a Hearing on the Impact of the Supreme Courts CitizensUnited Ruling   It has been ten years since the Supreme Court released its disastrous ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.

We did what the gift of U.S. citizenship requires us to do.
"               The End of Our National Nightmare On Wednesday, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump on both Articles of Impeachment."
Thus ending our months-long national nightmare.
"Over the past four months, America watched as House leadership forced a partisan impeachment investigation at the expense of putting the country first."
This fundamental failure of duty degrades the institution and defied the standards of decorum normally present in this great body.
Engaging in actions as grave as impeachment to remove a sitting President based on policy and personality disagreements threatens the separation of powers the founders so deliberately placed in the Constitution.
We have known the outcome of this trial since Speaker Pelosi announced the investigation for Articles of Impeachment.
"Nevertheless, members of the Senate took their responsibility seriously and thus a majority voted to acquit the President of both charges."
"The State of The Union This week, President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress."
He delivered a message of hope to the American people.
The President laid out a forward-looking plan for our nation.
"In this ""Best is yet to come"" plan America's economy will continue to grow, the American family will have options for education, and the workforce will be strengthened through his Pledge to the American Worker."
"The morning after the State of the Union, I joined local radio shows - Hal and Brian, Dave and Amy, and Mark Davis to give my response."
"While speaking with them, I addressed Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripping up the archival copy of President Trump's remarks."
Her disrespectful actions were not only towards the President but to the heroes and their families that were honored that evening.
Her actions were unbecoming as the leader of the Peoples House.
It does not matter whether she agreed with the words spoken by the President; it is her duty as the presiding officer of the House of Representatives to conduct herself in a civil manner.
It is for these reasons that I supported Rep. Kay Granger's (R-TX) resolution of disapproval of the Speaker's actions.
Your Thoughts   Do you agree with Speaker Pelosi's action to rip up President Trump's SOTU speech?
"Yes No Other (please specify)       Spread The Word It is an honor to be able to hire veterans, which is why I am pleased to have received a grant from the Wounded Warrior Project."
"With this grant, I will be able to hire another veteran to assist veterans throughout the 26th District."
"If you know of a veteran or are interested yourself in being considered for atwo-year fellowship in my district office, please have them visit:gov/and search Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program."
"According to the fellowship program, veterans must meet the following requirements:Honorably discharged; Released from active duty within the last five years; Pay grades at or below E-5 or O-3; 20% or greater service connected disability rating (Purple Heart recipients are exempt from the service connected disability rating requirement)."
Veterans who are in receipt of a 20-year or Temporary Early Retirement (TERA) retirement are not eligible for the program.
" News from Representative Pappas               About Contact Services       ACERT Goes to Washington        Congressman Pappas meeting with Lara, first responders, and health care providers from Manchesters ACERT team    This week I was honored to be joined at the State of the Union address by my guest, Lara Quiroga."
"Lara started the first ACERT program in 2015 at Amoskeag Health, in collaboration with the Manchester Police Department and YWCA NH, to provide services and resources to children who have experienced trauma."
"ACEs, or Adverse Childhood Experiences, are events in a childs life which have asignificant negativeimpact on their future wellbeing."
"I introduced legislation that would allow for the creation of ACE Response Teams (ACERTs) throughout the country - teams based on the model Lara helped pilot in Manchester, which has since expanded to other towns including Laconia and Concord."
Laras role in creating ACERT in New Hampshire has been instrumental in addressing these challenges and protecting our kids.
I was proud to have her join me to highlight our shared vision of expanding ACERT to communities nationally.
You can click HERE to learn more about Lara and ACERT.
"Working Together to Strengthen the State of Our Union  While the state of our union is strong, we still have much more work to do to ensure that every American can share in our countrys success."
"I was pleased that the President, in his address to Congress this week, expressed his desire to work with Congress to tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing our families and our communities."
"I remain committed to working in a bipartisan fashion to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, reduce the cost of prescription drugs, ensure veterans get the care they have earned, and combat the addiction epidemic."
"However, we need more than words; we need action."
"In the House, we have already passed historic legislation that will make life-saving medications more affordable."
The Senate should immediately take up and pass H.R.
"3, and I urge the President to honor his commitment to sign it into law without delay."
I was disappointed that the President failed to outline a comprehensive vision to rebuild our nation and make badly needed investments in transportation and infrastructure.
The House has already advanced a far-reaching infrastructure framework.
I call on the President and my colleagues in the Senate to come to the table.
"The American people expect us to come together to seize these opportunities to deliver real results, and I wont rest until we make fundamental progress."
"Rebuilding Americas Infrastructure  Last week, I also helped unveil House Democrats new framework for a five-year, $760 billion investment that would create an estimated 10 million jobs and address some of the countrys most urgent infrastructure needs."
"This framework makes substantial federal investments in our nations roads, railways, and airports to move our economy and our country forward."
"Since I entered office, I have advocated for an infrastructure package that reflects the needs of our Granite State communities."
"This framework will allow us to advance legislation in the coming weeks to address our urgent infrastructure needs, create good-paying jobs, spur economic growth, and protect our environment."
I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this critical priority through the House.
Demanding Resolution to VA Provider Payment Issues        Congressman Pappas listening to VA community care providers and veterans in Laconia about VA provider payment issues    The care that community providers give to our veterans is so important.
It is also critical that community providersarepaid in a timely manner so that veterans can get the care they need without delay.
Thats why I was immediately concerned when my office heard repeatedly from community care providers about delays in payments and other issues with the VA -problems that arecosting them money and hindering care for veterans.
I led a bipartisan letter to the VA calling on the Department to move quickly toaddress these concerns.
We must demand better from the VA.
I will continue to do everything in my power to bring attention to this critical matter while working with my colleagues and the VA to ensure our veterans get the best care possible.
"In addition to this letter, I have met directly with care providers and veterans and will continue to press for answers in my role as Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs."
"If you are a community care provider who is experiencing issues like this with the VA, please contact my office so that we can help."
"Improving Efficiency at the VA  This week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report which found that the VA has failed to take meaningful action to address serious deficiencies in a key medical supplies purchasing program - problems that have slowed the delivery of care to veterans."
"As the Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I am committed to doing everything I can to enhance the quality of care at the VA."
"Unfortunately, the latest audit I requested shows that the VA has failed to make meaningful progress toward fixing the long-standing problems plaguing its inadequate and inefficient medical purchasing system."
"The failure to address this mismanagement is unacceptable, and I will continue to work with my colleagues and the VA to ensure that corrective action is taken immediately."
"               On the Hill with Denver Riggleman February 7, 2020 Friends,  Earlier this week in his State of the Union Address you heard the President speak about the Great American Comeback and what that means for American workers."
There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a blue-collar boom in this country.
"Thanks to Republican-led pro-growth policies, the American economy is stronger than ever."
"We have built an inclusive economy where the least well-off are making some of the fastest gains, and unemployment is at an all-time low."
"Thanks to the promise of the United States- Mexico- Canada Trade Agreement and the Phase One China trade deal, the American worker is stronger than ever."
"With a national unemployment rate of 3.5% and a Virginia unemployment rate of 2.6%, our farmers, manufacturers, and producers are positioned to profit."
"Just this month, President Trump signed the USMCA, which will create upwards of 176,000 new American jobs, including 48,000 manufacturing positions, which have the potential torevitalize Southside Virginia."
In his address President Trump addressed the great work he has done; I am proud to be partnering with him on Republican-led pro-growth policies.
In the past year I have been working hard for the people of our district.
"To revitalize the economy in Southside, we need a series of consecutive miracles; working together these programs can bring back jobs and educational opportunities to the rural parts of our district."
America is strong once again.
We will continue to grow the middle class and raise wages.
In the 5th District we will continue to bring consecutive miracles to Southside Virginia.
"I am excited about the recent jobs numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed that in January the U.S. added 225,000 new jobs."
Wages are up 3.1% over the past year and are growing fastest for America's working and middle class.
I am proud of the work we have done and know that under President Trump's leadership this success can continue.

"                                Dear Friend,   The weekly newsletter is a great way to stay up-to-date on the work I'm doing on behalf of our Valley."
I use this as a venue to tell the story of how the work I'm doing in Washington and in the district impacts you.
"Each week I will highlight important pieces of legislation I'm working on, show you how I'm engaging with constituents on the issues, and tell you about upcoming events in the district.This week I'm back in Washington working on important legislation to improve public access to water in the Valley."
Here are some highlights:   Fighting for water    Water is the lifeblood of our Valley.
Farmers need water to feed the world and life becomes near impossible for residents who lack clean drinking water.
I introduced a bill to provide funding for necessary repairs to the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct.
"These waterways are critical to supporting our Valley's water needs, yet they are decades old and showing their age."
"We need to invest in our water infrastructure now, for the future sustainability of our state."
"Expanding healthcare access             California is expected to face a massive shortfall of primary care doctors in the next 15 years, especially in rural and low-income communities.I recently introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act to increase our supply of doctors by providing funding for additional medical training in diverse and medically deprived communities, like the San Joaquin Valley."
"At this year's State of the Union, I invited one of our local dedicated Valley health professionals to be my guest:Enid Picart.A fourth year medical student at UCSF-Fresno, Enid has chosen to dedicate her career to improving healthcare for San Joaquin Valley residents."
"We need more passionate people like Enid, who know our communities, to stay and commit to our future."
"With an investment in them, we can ensure every Valley resident has access to the healthcare they deserve."
Rep. Costa with State of the Union guest Enid Picart.
"Honoring a hometown hero             I introduced a resolution to honorapioneer in the Latino community and Fresno native, Tom Flores, and urge he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."
Coach Flores was recently passed over forthe honor despite his noteworthy achievements in the sport.
"As the first Latino starting quarterback andhead coach to win two Super Bowls with the Raiders, andfirst Latino head coach andgeneral manager of the Seattle Seahawks and in professional football history, his accomplishments on the gridiron prove he ismorethandeserving of this honor."
Improving Valley infrastructure    I'm pleased to announce that Merced County is opening Phase II of Campus Parkway and breaking ground on Phase III.
"When completed, this vital infrastructure project will connect UC Merced to both Highway 140 and Highway 99, improving traffic circulation, andproviding betteraccess to health services and economic opportunity."
Working together in a bipartisan effort is key to improving our Valley's infrastructure.
"Supporting global women's health    As a strong supporter of reproductive rights throughout my career, I believe it is critical for the United States to fund programs that improve the lives of millions of women around the world."
"In a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, we discussed the Global Gag Rule and other policies of this Administration to restrict access to family planning tools."
Many of these policies have undermined the United States' commitment to global public health and resulted in economic and physical harm to women around the globe.
Pushing for responsible forest management    One of my top priorities is to see our taxpayer dollars come back to the district.
I'm pleased to report that the Fresno Regional Workforce and Development Board (FRWDB) secured an important CalFire grant to improve the health of our forests.
Wildfires in California continue to have devastating impacts on our economy and air quality in the Valley.
This new partnership will create 100 new skilled forestry jobs to help alleviate these effects.
"If we are to combat these growing threats, we need to bolster our efforts to responsibly manage our forests."
Other work on behalf of our Valley:  Voted to advance  that would provide funding to counter the damage Nutria are doing to our waterways in California.

Meeting of the Week:    It's always a pleasure to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
"This year at the United Nations Holocaust Observance, we had a productive discussion about building the relationship between the UN and our government in Washington, the UN's role in combating the climate crisis, and working to improve collaboration with our transatlantic partners."
I will continue working with the UN and other nations around the world to promote global peace and prosperity.

"            February 7, 2020               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Applauding the 2020 State of the Union Address     President Trump delivered an incredibly strong State of the Union as he highlighted his record of results for the American people."
"The Presidents emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, and Ive been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district."
"I am especially proud that President Trump announced his public support for my bicameral, bipartisan voluntary paid leave bill for hardworking families that does not increase taxes or create a new government program.This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy."
"This effort is yet another example of the critical, bipartisan work in Congress that I am proud to lead with the support of my colleagues."
"During his remarks, President Trump also surprised the family of Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams with his unexpected return from deployment in Afghanistan."
"Sergeant Williams is originally a native of Peru, New York."
He is also a past Peru Fire Department Firefighter.
"I am proud that Sergeant Williams hails from the North Country, and it was incredible to witness him and his family reunite as they were honored for the sacrifices they have made in the name of our freedom."
"I thank Sergeant Williams for his service, and I am proud that President Trump reaffirmed his support for our military families."
"I was also proud to have David Fisher, dairy farmer from St. Lawrence County, accompany me to the State of the Union as my guest."
"David and the Fisher family have been operating Mapleview Dairy for four generations in Madrid, New York."
"David has been an active member of his community, serving on the Madrid Town Board for many years, and is currently also in his second term as President of the New York Farm Bureau."
He has been an outspoken advocate for farmers in the North Country.
"He is well versed on agriculture issues and always makes sure that Upstate New York agriculture has a seat at the table, particularly on results like the USMCA."
It was great to have him in the audience.
"Statement on the Acquittal of President Trump  This week, the impeachment charade started by Speaker Pelosi, abused by Adam Schiff, and finished by Leader McConnell has finally come to a close."
"Throughout this unfair and unprecedented process, I proudly stood up for the Constitution, the facts of the case, and my constituents in New Yorks 21st district."
I applaud the Senates diligence in their trial and just acquittal of the President.
I'm looking forward to getting back to work for the American people.
Meeting with Constituents and Organizations Important to the North Country        It was great to meet with a variety of constituent groups and organizations important to my work on behalf of the North Country this week.
"I discussed the importance of rural broadband, funding for students with disabilities, and school safety with the New York State School Board Association."
"I met with the North Country Workforce Development Board leadership about increasing access to affordable child care, workforce development priorities, and helping dislocated workers and rehabilitated former non-violent offenders successfully reenter the workforce."
I also met with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to discuss prison reform and funding for the drug free communities program.
We also discussed the vaping epidemic facing our youth and the need for funding to go towards addiction prevention and education.
It is always great to meet with constituents from the district and discuss the issues most important to them.
Hearing directly from my constituents guides my work and priorities in Congress.
"Opposing New York State Law Causing Suspension of Global Entry, Trusted Traveler Programs for New York Residents  This week, in response to New York States Green Light Law, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced their decision to suspend enrollment in Global Entry and other trusted-traveler programs for New York State residents."
"The Green Light Law, which took effect in December 2019, allows issuance of a drivers license to illegal immigrants."
"In making their decision, DHS cited that the states sanctuary policies that safeguard immigrants from deportation."
"DHS will immediately stop accepting new applications from New York State residents to enroll or re-enroll in some of the agencys travel programs, including Global Entry."
New York is the only state to be impacted by DHSs decision thus far.
"After repeatedly ignoring law enforcement experts at the federal and local level, Governor Cuomos prioritization of illegal immigrants over law abiding New Yorkers is continuing to have damaging effects."
"The Governors reckless Green Light Law not only has hampered efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, it is continuing to have harmful implications for our state."
"In December of last year, I warned Governor Cuomo that this irresponsible policy would inhibit our CBP officers at the Northern Border from doing their jobs."
"Qualified, legal citizens should not be penalized by the Governors unconscionable actions, which not only hinder our border patrol, law enforcement, and other agencies from being able to effectively do their job, but now also prevent our residents from receiving access to important travel programs."
"Helping the House Pass the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act  This week, I voted in favor of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, legislation that I proudly cosponsored."
This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and helps meet the needs of communities by increasing funding and reauthorizes the program through the next five years.
"Over the past decade, the GLRI has assisted Great Lakes communities after decades of environmental damage threatened public health, regional economies, and drinking water."
The GLRI has enabled the 8-state region along the Great Lakes to undertake one of the worlds largest freshwater ecosystem restoration projects.
"Assisting our communities in cleaning up their drinking water systems, restoring fish and wildlife habitats, and combating invasive species are critical examples of how this GLRI funding benefits North Country communities."
"This funding plays an essential role in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes and the ecosystems that surround them, and I am proud to continue to advocate in full support of its projects."
Leading Coordination with State and Local Officials to Support Fort Drum Designation as Army Corps Headquarters    Fort Drum is now one of the three final options for designation as a fourth Army Corps headquarters.
"I am proud to be leading the effort in coordinating support between local and state elected officials, community groups, and local businesses in the area surrounding Fort Drum to advocate for the installations selection as the final site."
"I sent a letter to the Army advocating for Fort Drum's designation, and led many petitions, signed by hundreds of constituents with more signing on each day, in support of the stationing and activation of the additional headquarters at Fort Drum."
My offices have worked closely with Advocate Drum to coordinate an outpouring of support from the North Country.
"Fort Drum is the best option for the activation and stationing of the Armys fourth corps headquarters, and I am proud to be passionately advocating for this alongside my constituents."
"As the number one advocate for Fort Drum, I have worked tirelessly to lead the coordination efforts across the North Country, to build support for the Armys consideration."
I will continue to raise awareness that Fort Drum has unmatched capabilities and ready to rapidly expand to meet the criteria to support an Army corps headquarters.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:     ___________________  Featured Read:  Watertown Daily Times -President references Stefanik legislation in SOTU address  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said President Donald Trump delivered an incredibly strong State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he highlighted the Congresswomans legislation on paid leave and child tax credit.The Presidents emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, Ms. Stefanik said after the address, and Ive been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.During the address, Mr. Trump said he was proud to sign a law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave."
"And he called on Congress to pass the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, which he said would extend family leave to mothers and fathers across the nation."
"Im grateful President Trump highlighted my bipartisan, bicameral legislation during his State of the Union address, Ms. Stefanik said."
"This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy.Ms."
"Stefanik said the act would allow families the option to advance up to $5,000 of their recently-doubled child tax credit in the first year of a childs life or the first year a family adopts a child."
"Most other paid leave proposals require parents to take off work to receive benefits, a release from Ms. Stefanik said."
This bill allows teleworkers the option to access child care benefits and to continue working from home while they take care of their new child.
The bill does not raise taxes or take away from Social Security.
"It is the product of more than a year of work to craft a bill that could pass with bipartisan support, the release said."

"                           Dear Lindsey,  Over the years, Ive helped people as a consumer protection attorney, supported public schools as a volunteer, raised two wonderful children, served as a state legislator, and Im now honored to represent beautiful NW Oregon in the US House of Representatives."
"Eight years ago, when I took my first oath of office in Congress, I swore to support and defend the US Constitution."
I thought of that oath often as the House considered whether to impeach President Trump.
Ivoted for impeachmentbecause of the overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power by asking a foreign country to meddle in our election and then trying to cover up his wrongdoing by obstructing the Houses investigation.
History will judge the Senates vote yesterday to acquit President Trump.
"As the House continues our work on behalf of the American people, we will build on thehundreds of bipartisan billswe have already passedandcontinue touphold our Constitutional dutyto bea vigorouscheck on the Trump administration."
Join Me at a Town Hall Meeting in April Every year I hold town hall meetings around NW Oregon so I can hear firsthand from the people Im honored to represent.
My spring series of town hall meetings will include six events in April.
There will be additional details foreach event on my websitesoon.
All weekday events will be in the evening.
"Vernonia Monday, April 6   Tigard  Tuesday, April 7   Portland  Saturday, April 11   Warrenton  Monday, April 13   McMinnville  Tuesday, April 14   Hillsboro  Thursday, April 16       We All Need Health Care Access tohealth care is a human right, but far too often people in our community face communication, cultural, and financial barriers that prevent them from accessing care."
"Thats why I brought Serena Cruz, the Executive Director of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Foundation and an advocate for health care accessibility and immigrant rights,asmy guest at the State of the Union address."
Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Centerprovidescriticalhealth careservicesand is named for a six-year-old daughter of migrant farm workers who died after a cut in her foot became infected.
"If she had been able to access health care, Virginia would have turned 51 years oldlast month."
"Today, Serena reports that the clinic is seeing pregnant women who are too afraid to seek the prenatal care they need because of the frequent attacks byPresidentTrumpandhis administration onimmigrantsandpeople of color."
We must stand up for all members of our community.
"In Congress, I am committed to stopping hateful policies and fighting for increased access to health care for all."
"Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt Addressing the high cost of higher education is one of my priorities, and one of the reasons I entered public service."
"Students today face a very different reality than I did: I was able to work my way through community college, a bachelors degree, and a law degree with a manageable amount of debt."
"When I sent out a survey about student loans last fall, more than 700 people responded."
"They described their student debt as being stressful, burdensome, painful, and overwhelming."
"To help these borrowers and others like them, I recentlyheld a clinic on student loan debtwith a national expert."
"There are commonsense steps that Congress can take to address crushing student debt, like making it easier for borrowers to access and stay inaffordablerepayment plans."
The House Education  Labor Committee included that provision and several others I drafted in the College Affordability Act.
I hope the House will vote on this legislation soon to provide needed relief to students and borrowers.
"At Home and at the Border, Trump's Anti-Immigrant Policies Cause Harm I recently visited the Southern Borderto investigate the Trump Administrations Remain in Mexico policy, which hasstranded tens of thousands of asylum-seekersin dirty and dangerous tent camps."
"In Matamoros, Mexico, Isaw families and many children living in squalor, without running water or adequate food.This isno way to treat familieswho are coming to the United States to escape violenceor persecution and who have the right to request asylum under international law."
"When I returned home I met with nine asylum-seekers, including an unaccompanied child, who are participating in the legal asylum process."
"They told me about the dangers they fled and the hardship they have experienced here, all in the hope of making their case for asylum and building a better life in the United States of America."
Too often this administration has attacked immigrants and fueled racism and xenophobia.
"In a roundtable discussion witha dozen local advocates, I heard about how fear and anxiety is clouding the lives of our immigrant neighbors, includingDreamers who have known no other homeand now risk being deported."
"Istand with our immigrant neighborsand our friends, who are an integral part of our communities andmustbe treated with dignity."
"In Case You Missed It  I helped improve themajor new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canadain the areas of labor, environment, access to medicines, and enforcement."
"After a protracted battle with the Administration, we secured anagreement that is better for Oregonians, workers, and the environment."
"My bipartisanBlue Carbon for the Planet Actwill harness the powerful ability ofhealthy wetlands, tidal marshes, and seagrassestosequestercarbon for centuries or even millennia and mitigate the climate crisis."
"The House passed thebipartisanProtecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act,whichI co-led, toprotect thecivil rights of older workersin the workplace."
I alsohelped advancelegislation tomake sure thatpregnant workershave the accommodations they needtowork and stay healthyduring pregnancy.

"                      New Year Updates                 Palmer's Perspective ""The truth is incontrovertible."
"Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is."""
Winston Churchill  I think the above quote may well describe the hope that many of us have for the state of politics in America and our ability to govern.
"Truth and common sense are under assault as the Socialist majority in the House of Representatives continues to mislead the American public in an attempt to gain full control of our government, and ultimately of our futures."
"There are so many issues on which Democrats are refusing to acknowledge the truth, but there are a few that have been particularly glaring within the first few weeks of this new year."
"False attacks against President Trump have been relentless, even to the point of condemning the killing of one of Americas most ruthless enemies."
"President Trumps decision to give the order for our military to kill Qasem Soleimani, the head of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, should have been lauded by Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat colleagues as a fully justified strike to protect Americans and our allies."
Both parties should have supported it and reinforced that it was a needed warning to other terrorists.
"But, bolstered by the left-wing media, prominent Democrat politicians staunchly refused to acknowledge that this was a good decision from President Trump, even seeming to openly side with Irans oppressive governmentand characterizing Soleimani as a reasonable and admired leader in Iran."
"The truth is that Soleimani was a ruthless despotresponsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including hundreds of Americans."
"While Democrats and leftist media condemned President Trump for his actions, freedom-seeking Iranians who suffered the cruelty and terror of Soleimani were celebrating in the streets."
"Whats more, after a months-long miscarriage of justice in an effort to impeach President Trump, Speaker Pelosi sent articles of impeachment to the Senate, knowing full well that there was little chance of removal from office."
The Senate has now voted to fully acquit President Trump.
There was never evidence that the President committed an impeachable offense.
President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine both repeatedly said that there was no connection between foreign aid and an investigation and that there was no pressure.
"Chairman Schiff lied repeatedly throughout the process and continues to lie, evenabout his lies."
"In my opinion and the opinion of many others, what Speaker Pelosi and her hand-picked co-conspirators did was a massive abuse of power that would have undermined future elections and would have led to a Constitutional crisis."
Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues also continue trying to convince American families and workers that they are worse off now compared to before President Trump took office.
The evidence points to the exact opposite.
Indicator after indicator has shown how much better off people from all income levels are.
"Median household income is up, taxes are lower, regulations are less burdensome and costly, energy costs are down, and unemployment is at a record low."
"And, finally, the Democrats in the House still refuse to acknowledge the right to life for unborn children.For years pro-life men, women and children have peacefully gathered in Washington to speak up for the rights of unborn children."
"Every year that I have been a member of Congress, Congress has been in session during the week of the March for Life."
"This year, Speaker Pelosi chose for the House to recess during the week of the March for Life."
Democrats have also repeatedly refused even to vote on legislation that would protect children after they are born following an attempted abortion.
"This issue is perhaps where truth has been denied the most strenuously for decades, and we must continue to fight."
I am very grateful for all the people from Alabama and from all across America who are courageously and compassionately standing up for the lives of unborn children.
"In sum, the events of the last several weeks have left me with deep concernfor where our countryis headed."
"Theyve revealed to me that there are Democrat members of Congress who genuinely believe President Trump was wrong to kill Soleimani, who believe the government should take away your right to make your own health care decisions, who want to destroy the ability of people to make a good living, and who are pro-death, even for babies that survive an abortion attempt."
"I pray that the American people will recognize that the future is in the balance, stand with us to get our nation back on the right track, and who will fight for the truth, even when it is denied and attacked."
"Press Talks Washington Times: I'm thankful for the opportunity to contribute a piece to the Washington Times about Iran, the killing of Qasem Soleimani, and the actions that led to that decision."
"Alabama's Morning News with JT: Impeachment has now moved to the Senate, but the process is still riddled with falsehoods and injustice."
I enjoyed talking with JT and giving the latest perspective and updates on the impeachment proceedings.
The bottom line: the facts haven't changed!
Talk 99.5 with Matt  Aunie: It's always a good time when I can talk with Matt and Aunie.
"In this conversation, we discussed where the impeachment proceedingsare headed from here, the 2020 elections coming up, and how past failings in foreign policies contributed to recent actions in Iran."
The Jeff Poor Show: It was great to catch up with Jeff Poor about the situation in Iran and on where the impeachment trial stands in the Senate.
In the District Constituent Highlight: Many congratulations to Sheriff John Samaniego for his recent appointment to the President's new Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice!
Sheriff Samaniego has served Alabama's Sixth District with honor and I'm confident he will continue to do so in this prestigious new position.
New I-59/I-20 Interstate Bridges: The new bridges for I-59 and I-20 have been officially completed and opened!
I was glad to be able to speak at the opening and to be part of the ribbon cutting.
This is an important milestone for Birmingham and I trust the new bridges will serve central business district well.
The project began in 2015 and cost $700 million.
The NO Bill of the Month No War Against Iran Act(H.R.
"5543, amendment to H.R."
550)  This legislation is in keeping with many Democrats' stringent denial of facts regarding Iran policy.
It is one more part of their effort to paint President Trump's order to kill Soleimani as reckless and unfair.
"In reality, both Iranians and Americans are safer with Soleimani out of the picture, and this billonly addsneedless restrictions."
"It would limit the accessibility of funds for using military force in Iran, and it tries to restrict the President's decision-making power when it comes to engaging in conflict with Iran."
The War Powers Act of 1973 already put a check on the President's power when it comes to military force and declaring war.
"In short, this legislation tries to restrict the President's ability to defend the American people from a regime that consistently supports terrorism and provokes conflict in the Middle East."
"The only reason for this bill is the Democrats' disdain for anything President Trump does, even when he takes out a terrorist."
It was very easy for me to vote no on this legislation.
"Hearing Highlights In the continued obsession with finding somethingillegal to pin on President Trump, the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee held another hearing about the Trump Hotel lease and alleged violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution."
The hotel has been used as yet another weapon in the relentless attacks against the President instead of turning attention to the many pressing issues that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee could focus on.
I made these concerns clear in my questions and also made the point that paying a market rate for a hotel room is not what the Founders had in mind when they put in place measures to limit foreign influence from emoluments.
The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee recently held a hearing on water resources and related projects.
I expressed my concernregarding a huge backlog of proposals on water infrastructure.
I was grateful for the chance to discuss this with the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Watch my questions here.
Floor Action Floor Speech:Here arethe remarks I made in opposition to impeachment just before Christmas.
"The concerns I expressed then still hold now, and I hope the Senate will summarily dismiss the articles."

"The MPP allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to return applicants for admission to the United States to Mexico, pending their asylum application hearings."
"Ive visited refugee camps around the world, and the conditions that the U.S. government is forcing these asylum-seekers to suffer are a disgrace to our nation and our shared values."
"Congressman DeFazio standing in front of a makeshift shelter in the city of Matamoros, Mexico, which contains the largest refugee camp along the U.S.-Mexico Border of an estimated 2,000 people."
"In Matamoros, I witnessed roughly 3,000 individuals living in squalor."
"It is so dangerous, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisorythe same as Iran and Syriafor the area."
"The Mexican cartel operates openly and freely, and kidnapping, violence, and sexual assault are rampant."
I met one woman who had fled El Salvador with her three daughters.
"Every night she sleeps outside her tent, on the zipper, to protect her daughters from being kidnapped and forced into sex trafficking."
"Despite widespread disease, including numerous cases of chronic infections, medical care is woefully inadequate."
"Basic infrastructure is also almost non-existent: open latrines filled with raw sewage exist immediately next to the Rio Grande, the contaminated river where families wash their laundry."
"On the day of their hearing, individuals must arrive at the border checkpoint by 4:30 AM."
Most petitioners are unable to see their court paperwork until that day.
"Approximately one percent of asylum-seekers have a lawyer, and if they are lucky enough to have representation, they usually meet their lawyer for the first time on the day of their hearing."
"They are given, at most, an hour to discuss their case and the hearing."
"An estimated 60,000 asylum seekers have been forced back into Mexico under the MPP."
"Of those 60,000, roughly 120 have been granted asylum or some other relief."
We need to end the Remain in Mexico policy now.
Thats why I am one of roughly 50 members of Congress cosponsoring H.R.
"2662, the Asylum Seeker Protection Act, which would terminate the deplorable MPP program."
I hope more members of Congress go to Matamoros to bear witness to these conditions for themselves.
Perhaps then Congress will finally have the courage to act.
"Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr, His Legacy, and the Fight for Equality On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I was honored to address members of the Eugene community about Dr. Kings legacy of equality and the incredible contributions of women across the nation and in our community to promote equity."
"Since taking office, the president and the GOP have implemented policies that threaten the rights of women and people of color."
I am frustrated that many hard-won civil rights battles are at risk in todays political climate.
"As my friend and colleague, civil rights hero Congressman John Lewis noted, Of all the gifts given us by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I think the greatest has been the belief in societys ability to change and the power each of us has to affect that change."
We must not give up our fight.
"There is no expiration date on equality, Watch my full remarks to the Eugene MLK Jr. Day March here."
"In January, Virginia became the pivotal 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), finally guaranteeing equal protections regardless of sex in our nations Constitution."
"With Virginias action, the ERA could finally be added to our Constitution  but the Trump administrations Department of Justice is determined to stop this from happening and has issued a legal opinion arguing that the ratification deadline has passed."
Well to them I say this  there is no expiration date on equality.
I am a proud cosponsor of H.J.Res.
"38, legislation which would lift the arbitrary ERA ratification deadline."
"Majority Leader Hoyer has already announced his intention to bring this important legislation to the floor next month, and I look forward to giving it my full support."
"I have also cosponsored and voted for legislation to fight for equality, such as tackling the wage discrimination that women and minorities face (H.R."
"7  Paycheck Fairness Act), protecting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault (H.R."
"1585  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act), and protecting a womens right to choose (H.R."
"2975, Womens Health Protection Act, H.R."
1692  EACH Woman Act).
"Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a priority to fight for equality."
"As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment which guaranteed womens constitutional right to vote, you can be sure I will continue to do everything in my power to defend a womans right to choose, protect access to critical healthcare, and strive to ensure the ERAs addition to our Constitution."
"Discussing Science and Policy with OSU Students Last week, I spoke with Oregon State University students at a Science and Policy class taught by Dr. Jane Lubchenco, a world-renowned environmental scientist who served as the U.S."
"Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and served as an inaugural member of President Barack Obamas Science Team from 2009-2013."
We discussed the importance of integrating fact-based science and policy to inform policymakers on the existential crisis of climate change.
"On the same day, a new report from NOAA revealed the devastating effects climate change is already inflicting on Dungeness crabs fisheries in the Pacific Northwest."
"The study found that ocean acidification along the Pacific Northwest is impacting the shells and sensory organs of Dungeness crabs, which could cause developmental delays and interfere with maturation."
"The Dungeness crab fishery is a multi-million-dollar industry in Oregon, and the report is one more disturbing example of just how urgent and overdue legislative action is."
"Thats why I am a cosponsor of the COAST Research Act, which would address the effects of ocean acidification on our marine ecosystems."
"This legislation, which passed the House with my full support last year, would reauthorize the Ocean Acidification Program of NOAA and expand research efforts to monitor the effects of coastal acidification."
"While I am proud that the House was able to pass this legislation, there is much more work that needs to be done to protect our oceans and address climate change."
"The ability to protect the environment and address climate change is dependent on the foundation of science that is independently verifiable and free from political interference or bias, ideology, and conflicts of interests."
"I have and will continue to promote policies that are based in science, protect our environment, and reduce carbon pollution."
"Juliana v. United States Case Dismissed, But Not Defeated Im angered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissal of the landmarkJuliana v. United States, aconstitutional climate lawsuit led by 21 youth plaintiffs, including seven from Oregons 4th Congressional District."
"In the face of a president and Republican-led Senate who blatantly ignore and discount the existential threat posed by climate change, the youth plaintiffs are working to bring our nation one step closer to achieving a legal foundation and requirement to solve this crisis."
"Last year, I was proud to back the youth plaintiffs by filing an amicus curiae brief with the Ninth Circuit Court."
The plaintiffs of this lawsuit understand that the existential threat of climate change denies them the kind of future we should all be guaranteed under the Constitution.
"While the plaintiffs have requested the full Ninth Circuit to review the decision, Congressmusttake urgent action on climate change."

"                        CONTACT  MEDIA                Dear Friend, This week, President Trump gave his third State of the Union address."
He outlined the Great American Comeback story that he and his Administration have led.
"During the speech, he laid out an optimistic vision about how we can continue this progress and build a better future for all."
Continuing reading to see my full statement on the State of the Union speech.
"Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump on the partisan articles of impeachment sent to them by House Democrats."
Congress has been tied up for months with the House Democrats impeachment obsession.
Partisan politics need to be put aside.
Its long past time to put this impeachment charade behind us and get back to work for the American people.
State of the Union President Trump continues to put America first and advance the interests of our nation.
The strong economy under this administration is lifting Americans everywhere.
"This administration successfully negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which created 176,000 new jobs, added $68 billion in new economic growth and was a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses."
He also delivered on a historic Phase One trade agreement with China.
I was happy to hear the President speak on the jobs created in the opportunity zones established in the Republican tax cut bill.
"In Georgia, 260 opportunity zones have attracted investments  including in Muscogee County  and brought new economic opportunities to our local community."
This administration has made tremendous progress in fixing our broken immigration system and securing our border.
I was pleased to hear the Presidents plans to continue building a safe and legal immigration system by facing head-on the public safety threat posed by sanctuary cities.
"The Presidents remarks on issues facing working families, from ensuring that every child can get a great education, to supporting Americas parents as they manage the demands of their careers while raising children were also commendable."
"While the Democrats continue to embrace socialist healthcare policies, the President thoughtfully laid out his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs while maintaining the highest standard of care and access to the most innovative cures."
President Trump has kept his promises and America is strong once again.
"As he made clear in his remarks, there are many opportunities for Congress to help Americans and keep our nation moving forward."
"I remain committed to working with President Trump, his administration and my colleagues in Congress to continue to grow our 21st century economy and create an environment that ensures opportunity for all."
"Mobile Office Hours Members of my staff will be in Fayetteville and Hamilton on Wednesday, February 12th to meet with constituents and assist anyone experiencing a problem with a federal agency."
Telephone Town Hall I'm excited to announce I will be hosting my nexttelephonetownhall on February 11th starting at 6:30PM.
"With all that is happening in Washington, D.C., I want to take the time to hear from the folks back home because your opinions are important to me."

This Week in Photos  I had the opportunity to congratulate some exceptional students from Georgia's Third District on their appointments to our nations military service academies.
"There is no higher calling than to serve our country in the armed forces, and I am proud to have nominated these students."

"                                              Dear Lindsey,  Last night, Cadott grain and dairy farmer Les Danielson joined me for the State of the Union to share a message with President Trump: Keep your promises and deliver results for Wisconsin farmers before its too late."
Les has been farming for 30 years in northwest Wisconsin.
"A member of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, Les has witnessed firsthand as dairy farms have gone out of business throughout the state since President Trump took office, including one only three miles from his farm in Cadott."
Les is concerned about the future of agriculture for his children and family farmers as President Trumps trade wars and tariffs have produced tough times for Wisconsin farmers.
Its time for President Trump to move past empty promises and outline a clear plan to get the job done for farmers like Les.
That is why Im continuing my work to keep the pressure on in Washington and do right by Wisconsin farmers and our agriculture economy.
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I worked last year to secure $20 million for my Dairy Business Innovation Initiative, as well as $10 million to provide our nations farmers and agricultural workers with more mental health resources as they work through these stressful times."
Ive also introduced bipartisan legislation to help combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products.
"Imitation products have gotten away with using dairys good name for their own benefit, which is against the law and must be enforced."
My DAIRY PRIDE Acttakes a stand for dairy farmers in Wisconsin who work tirelessly every day to ensure that their milk meets high standards for nutritional value and quality.
Im going to keep my promises and continue working in the Senate to get the job done for farmers like Les so that we can strengthen our Made in Wisconsin agriculture economy.
"        In remarks on the Senate floor today, Senator Romney explained how he intends to vote this afternoon on the Articles of Impeachment."
He intends to vote guilty on Article I and not guilty on Article II.
"His remarks can be viewed below and the full text of his remarks is as follows:   The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republics success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it."
The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of Congress for these many days.
We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it.
"We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each others good faith."
The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious.
"As a Senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise impartial justice."
I am a profoundly religious person.
I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.
"I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the President, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced."
The House Managers presented evidence supporting their case; the White House counsel disputed that case.
"In addition, the Presidents team presented three defenses: first, that there can be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that the Bidens conduct justified the Presidents actions; and third that the judgement of the Presidents actions should be left to the voters."
Let me first address each of those defenses.
"The historic meaning of the words high crimes and misdemeanors, the writings of the Founders and my own reasoned judgement convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office."
To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove a president defies reason.
The Presidents counsel noted that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian Prosecutor General.
"If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself."
"While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong."
"With regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his fathers name is unsavory but also not a crime."
"Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the Presidents counsel that a crime had been committed, the Presidents insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit."
"There is no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the President would never have done what he did."
The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters.
"While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitutions requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president."
Hamilton explained that the Founders decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to voters was intended to minimizeto the extent possiblethe partisan sentiments of the public.
This verdict is ours to render.
The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfilled our duty.
The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.
The President asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival.
The President withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so.
The President delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders.
The Presidents purpose was personal and political.
"Accordingly, the President is guilty of an appalling abuse of the public trust."
"What he did was not perfect No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security interests, and our fundamental values."
Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of ones oath of office that I can imagine.
"In the last several weeks, I have received numerous calls and texts."
"Many demand that, in their words, I stand with the team."
I can assure you that that thought has been very much on my mind.
I support a great deal of what the President has done.
I have voted with him 80% of the time.
But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and biases aside.
"Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented, and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to historys rebuke and the censure of my own conscience."
"I am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced."
I am sure to hear abuse from the President and his supporters.
Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?
"I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he said might raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment."
"Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country."
I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence.
I am convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.
"As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction."
"We have come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience."
I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the President from office.
The results of this Senate Court will in fact be appealed to a higher court: the judgement of the American people.
"Voters will make the final decision, just as the Presidents lawyers have implored."
My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate.
"But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me."
"I will only be one name among many, no more or less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial."
"They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the President did was wrong, grievously wrong."
Were all footnotes at best in the annals of history.

     News from Representative Bustos                                  Dear Lindsey  I just left the House chamber where the President delivered his State of the Union address.
"Tonight, President Trump spoke about a Great American comeback."
"But too many who wrestle with soaring drug prices, crumbling infrastructure and an uncertain economic future still feel like they are falling further behind."
The state of our health care is anything but strong.
This Administration put Americans health security on the chopping block by threatening those with pre-existing conditions and failing for the past three years to fulfill promises to lower prescription drug prices.
Americans need more than just assurances.
The State of the Union should be a unique opportunity to unite Americans.
"Tonights address missed the mark.I continue to stand ready to work with the President on bipartisan priorities like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, rebuilding our infrastructure, investing in broadband and expanding career and technical education."
Real progress will require a genuine effort at partnership.
Congresswoman Bustos with her guest Cindy Ramos and American Diabetes Associations CEO Tracey Brown.
Id like to thank Cindy Ramos for being my guest to this years speech and for bravely sharing her story.
Ms. Ramos is an advocate for the American Diabetes Association who has experienced first-hand the challenges of rising drug prices after struggling to afford her insulin.
Thats why I was honored she joined me to bring awareness to this critical issue.
"Last year, I was proud to help pass the Lower Drug Costs Now Act to help people like Cindy, who struggle with rising prescription drug prices."
"Until next time, Cheri                                   Please don't reply to this email."

"News from Representative Haaland                           About Contact Services        February 5, 2020  Dear Lindsey,  Every person in this country deserves a fair shot at success, but President Trump is failing hard-working American families."
"Last night, President Trump gave a misleading picture."
The reality is that Trumps policies are immoral and they hurt women and children in our communities while enriching himself and his friends.
"As I escorted President Trump to the House Chamber, I was representing our For the People Agenda, a bold contrast to President Trump, reminding everyone that this country is for them  no matter where they come from, what their background, or who they love."
"As President Trump expands his Muslim ban and his officials announce that they will target DREAMers, I am proud that my colleagues and I passed the American Dream and Promise Act and I will fight for us to pass the No BAN Act to put an end to this and future discriminatory travel bans."
"As a Vice Chair of the Equality Caucus, I am advocating against the attacks on our LGBTQ community and am using my new position on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold this Administration accountable."
"President Trump touts a growing economy, but his policies are failing hard-working American families while enriching himself and his friends.And under Attorney General Barr, the Department of Justice is fighting in court to repeal the ACA, taking away healthcare from thousands of New Mexicans.President Trump has even announced he plans to cut Social Security and Medicare."
"Families in New Mexico and across the country know that this Administration's policies are working for the wealthy and well-connected, while hurting hardworking families."
"Almost 50,000 New Mexicans in our district rely on SNAP to feed their families, but are now threatened by rule changes that will take food away from hundreds of thousands of people across the country."
"As someone who had to rely on SNAP at times to keep food on the table, I know how important these programs are to our community."
"I will work with my colleagues to fight on behalf of every day New Mexicans, not just the wealthy."
"While President Trump claims to make us safer, he has disarmed us in our fight against climate change, which remains our greatest national security threat."
"I am proud to have voted for and passed the Climate Action Now Act, a bill aligning us the Paris Climate Accords and restoring our position leading the world in this fight."
The House of Representatives also passed the Scientific Integrity Act to ensure all decisions made by the federal government follow sound science instead of the whims of lobbyists.
"As the Vice Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, I will continue to hold up New Mexicos commitment to a renewable energy revolution as an example for the rest of the country."
"The President tried to claim credit for improving our national security, but instead he nearly dragged us into an unnecessary war and stole money from vital projects for his misguided border wall."
"New Mexicans have a proud history of heeding the call to service and deserve leadership that works for them, not uses them as props."
"As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was able to get housing protections for our military families, which will help all of our serving families living on Kirtland Air Force Base, as well as provisions to start the PFAS cleanup on Kirtland."
"Lastly, my membership on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the U.S. puts me in a position to hold the federal government to its trust responsibility to provide for healthcare, public safety, housing, and infrastructure programs."
"As part of this effort, I will continue to be a tireless advocate for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women so we can give a voice to this silent crisis and enact concrete solutions to address it."
"We do have things to be proud of over this past year, there have been victories and improvements for every day Americans due to the House of Representatives."
 News from Representative Larson                               Dear Friends   Thank you for taking the time to read my updates!
"Here are some highlights of what I worked on last week:  Legislative Updates:   Last week, I voted to stop the United States from going to war with Iran."
I voted to  (AUMF) that authorized the war with Iraq and to prevent President Trump from further escalating hostilities in the region by prohibiting any funding for war with Iran.
The House also approved the Keeping Girls in Schools Act (H.R.
2153) to address education barriers faced by 130 million adolescent girls around the world.
"As a cosponsor and a former teacher, I believe investing in education is one of the best ways to empower women, which will also have a ripple effect for their families and their communities."
"Letters:   As e-cigarettes cause health problems around the country, I sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Alex Azar, to urge the FDA to withdraw its ineffective rule and instead ban all flavored e-cigarettes."
"In November, the Trump Administration proposed a rule which would throw many disabled Social Security and SSI recipients off the rolls."
I led two letters to Social Security Administration Commissioner Saul requesting the agency withdraw this dangerous rule.
"You can watch my video regarding the rule with disability advocate, Peter Morely, ."
Ways and Means Committee Updates:   The Committee on Ways and Means held a hearing on legislative proposals to support paid family and medical leave.

"Im bringing Karen Battaglia, a nurse from Antioch as my official guest to the Presidents State of the Union address!"
Karen has spent most of her career working to improve the health and lives of thousands of people in our community.
"She is the Trauma Coordinator for Emergency Services at Northwestern Medicine McHenry, where along with her work to save lives, she is working to improve community safety."
"Throughout her time at Northwestern, Karen has coordinated community programs like SAFE Kids, poison prevention workshops, and community bicycle helmet fittings for children."

"Im so honored that when President Trump looks our way during the State of the Union, hell see not one, but TWO nurses with preexisting conditions who are fiercely fighting for their community."
"The risk of losing protections for people with preexisting conditions is real, and its terrifying for so many."
Republicans and this Administration have worked themselves breathless trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and throw our health care system in chaos.

"Wednesday, House Democrats released an infrastructure framework to invest $750 billion over five years in our roads, bridges, transit systems, railways, airports, ports, inland waterways, brownfields, broadband, and wastewater and drinking water systems."
I am encouraged that their framework included many things that are also important to my Republican colleagues and me.
"Historically, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has worked in a bipartisan manner to develop and pass legislation that prioritizes and invests in our nations infrastructure."

"(President Trump speaking at the 2019 State of the Union)  Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress   Constituent Corner A constituent contacted our office because Social Security was withholding $250.00 from her dependent grandchild's benefit check."
"Our office sent a congressional inquiry to the local Social Security office followed up, and learned the withholding of the benefits was a mistake and would be corrected."
"The constituent sent our office a letter stating, Thank you so much for your help."
I had been trying to do this for almost a year and no one would help me.
It's a shame that I lost that 250.00 for approximately 10 months because of their negligence.
But thank God you can call your local congressman and get help.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."

Her dedication and influence has impacted countless students and enhanced the educational culture in Lake County.
Congratulations to Christine for receiving this high honor!
"Legislative Update This week the House passed S. 153, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act."
This legislation directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish an interagency working group to coordinate federal programs and policies for transitioning veterans and military spouses into STEM careers.
It also directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a plan to increase outreach to veterans.
STEM education is essential and getting our veterans involved in these programs is a great way to bring them into the workforce after their service.
We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay and helping them join the civilian workforce is one way we can honor them.
"Survey Do you plan on watching President Trumps State of the Union Address on Tuesday, February 4th?"
"Since you won't get them in the State of the Union, here are some facts on the Trump economy By Rep. Don Beyer  February 4, 2020 When the president gives his State of the Union address this week, I expect him to demand credit for our strong economy."
"Doubtless, he will chalk it up to his supposed business acumen."
History tells us much of what he says will be false or misleading.
The president told a lie recently in a speech at Davos that we should expect to hear again: that the economy he inherited from Barack Obama was in dismal shape.
"He said that the current economy is booming due to his magic touchnot because Barack Obama helped dig us out from the worst recession since the Great Depression, or because of the hard work and ingenuity of American businesses and workers."
This is revisionist historyfar from the truth.
"Its one of more than 1,500 lies or misleading statements President Trump has made since his inauguration on the economy alone, according to The Washington Post Fact Checker."
"He has made more than 16,000 false or deceptive statements on all issues combined."
Was the economy a wreck as the president imagines?
Did his tax cuts supercharge economic growth?
Has the presidents trade war helped American businesses and consumers?
The evidence shows these assertions are absolutely falseand that in some ways Trump economic policy has done more harm than good.
Lets look at the facts.
"When President Trump took office, the economy was strong and getting stronger."
Unemployment had been cut by more than half and stood at 4.7 percent.
The economy had added jobs for 76 straight months.
"Wages were rising, inflation was low, GDP growth was solid."
To call this dismal is ridiculously dishonest.
"In important ways, the economy under Donald Trump has lagged behind the economy under Barack Obama."
"Lets look at job growthin the first 35 months of the Trump administration, the economy added about 191,000 jobs per month."
"In the last 35 months of the Obama administration, approximately 227,000 jobs were created each month."
"Thats 36,000 fewer jobs each month under Trump."
"How about business investment, which is key to long-term economic growth?"
"The Republican tax cuts, the presidents signature legislative accomplishment, were supposed to accelerate investment."
But growth in business investment has slowed after a small initial bump and it now has declined for three consecutive quarters.
GDP growth also has disappointed.
The president promised that his nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts would be like rocket fuel for the economy.
GDP growth would be as high as 6 percent!
But that hasnt happenedthe rocket fuel didnt power the economy skyward.
"Annual GDP growth has not reached 3 percent since the tax cuts were enacted, and it slowed to 2.3 percent in 2019."
Part of the challenge is that the presidents trade war has created headwinds for the economy.
It has harmed everyone from American suppliers to farmers to wholesalers to retailers to consumers.
"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the administrations trade policies will shave 0.5 percent from GDP this year and reduce average household income by nearly $1,300."
"Finally, there is the cost of the tax giveawaysthe increase to our national debt."
The president and his advisers promised that their 2017 tax cuts would pay for themselves.
There was extensive reporting on the second year anniversary of the tax cuts in December that this claim has proven false.
"However, just last week, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin doubled down on this myth."
CBO estimates that the tax cuts will add $1.9 trillion to our national debt.
"Deficits already have rocketed higher, from $585 billion during the last year of the Obama administration to $984 billion in 2019."
CBO forecasts the deficit will reach $1 trillion this year and an average $1.3 trillion between 2021 and 2030.
These fast-growing deficits when the economy is strong constrain investments we should be making in education and infrastructure now and will limit our fiscal response when we have to confront the next recession.
I suspect that these facts wont make it into the presidents State of the Union Address.
"As with so many other subjects, he will have alternative facts."
"Even though his version of reality has been proven to be fanciful, he will continue to claim that he inherited a dismal economy from Barack Obama and that he has worked miracles."
This isnt remotely true.
"The fact checkers are going to be very, very busy."
"                     Friends,  Education is one of the most critical components of our society today."
"It is how we formulate opinions and perspectives, gain exposure to different ideas and cultures, and develop new skills."
"With the knowledge and understanding gained from a solid education, we are able to learn how to be successful in our careers, family lives, and personal lives."
Lastweek was National School Choice Week.
"During this week long initiative, schools, organizations, and individuals planned thousands ofevents across the stateand country in order to raise public awareness of the value of school choice."
"All of Americas children deserve an education that benefits, challenges, and motivates them regardless of their background."
"I was proud to join state and national leaders, parents, and students inrecognizing this significant initiative."
National School Choice Week addresses the many options available to families throughout the United States and in the Second District.
Read more from my Weekly Column here.
"BIG NEWS IN THE SECOND DISTRICT  The Economic Development Administration has awarded both the Southeastand the Central Alabama Regional Planningand Development Commissions grants worth $210,000 each."
"Together, with local, publicand private partners, these investments will be used to create jobs, advance innovation,and strengthen our economy."
"TIPS FOR FLU SEASON  Last week, I attendeda House Membersbriefing on the recent Coronavirus outbreak."
"The CDC says thevirus is currently not spreading in the United States,but you can always help prevent the spread of respiratory illness by following thesesteps."
"As we arein the midst of flu season,it's important to take necessary steps in order to reduce our risk and others from catching the flu."

"MONTGOMERYSTUDENTS VISITWASHINGTON  Last Wednesday, students from Trinity Presbyterian School in Montgomery stopped by the Capitol during their annual trip to Washington."

"_____________________________________________________________  Introducing the ""Unborn Child Support Act""  Life begins at conception."
"Our laws should reflect that truth, especially when it comes to helping mothers provide for the welfare of their children, which is why I introduced the Unborn Child Support Act."""
This bill give mothers the ability to receive child support payments while they are pregnant.
"If we are going to be pro-life, we should be pro-all-of-life and ensure we give moms the support they need.The Unborn Child Support Act allows a court, in consultation with the mother, to award child support payments while the child is still in the womb and retroactively up to the point of conception as determined by a physician."
"Montana Senator Steve Daines, Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn and Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe joined the bill as original cosponsors."
"_____________________________________________________________  Impeachment Update  During the second week of impeachment, we heard the conclusion of the Presidents opening statement, asked questionsof both teams, and voted to move to the conclusion of the trial."
I joined Dana Bash on CNN prior to the Senate voting on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents.
"Throughout this entire trial, Democrats have failed to make the case for impeaching President Trump, and no witness would change that."
We will vote on the articles of impeachment this coming Wednesday and finally put this behind us.
"_____________________________________________________________  Senate VA Committee Passes HBOT and Tribal Affairs Legislation  During a committee markup this week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs (VA) passed the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019."
"This bill contains several provisions to improve mental health services for veterans, including an expansion of the VAs research into Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT).Ive witnessed firsthand the powerful difference Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy can make for our veterans."
Our legislation is a positive step.
"It advances the study of this treatment, which ought to create a pathway for more veterans to receive access to this care."
"If passed by the Senate, this legislation would authorize the Secretary of the VA to enter into public-private partnerships to research the effectiveness of HBOT, require the VA to use an objective test to measure the effectiveness of HBOT treatment, and commission a comprehensive review and study of HBOT, both within the VA and in outside organizations.During the same hearing, the Senate VA Committee also advanced bipartisan legislation to establish a Department of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Tribal and Indian Affairs."
This committee would exist to provide guidance and information on issues and concerns specific to Native American Veterans.
"The victory of getting this language  creating a Tribal and Indian Affairs Advisory Committee for the VA  was very special.In North Dakota, our Native Americans have the highest rate of military service of any ethnic group, and I think thats true throughout our country."
Theyre some of the most patriotic people I know.
"This Committee would provide an opportunity for them to have even greater input into the issues and the policies of the VA, as well as giving them access to the leaders."
"_____________________________________________________________  ""Never Again Act"" Passes the House  Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal and I were pleased to see the passage of the House counterpart to our bipartisan, the ""Never Again Education Act,"" which would establish dedicated federal funding to provide teachers with resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust."
I'm grateful to the House of Representatives for recognizing the importance of educating the next generation about this terrible moment in history.
Learning the lessons of the Holocaust helps ensure a tragedy such as this is never repeated.

I hope you enjoyed the big game yesterday.
"It was an exciting game (and, as a Seahawks fan, I was happy to see the Niners lose)."
The Groundhog Day commercial... and the food!
"I ate far too many chips, far too much dip, and way too many chicken wings."
"Actually, it was a pretty fun game (and my daughters have convinced me to become a fan of The Masked Singer)."
"Tomorrow, Ill be heading back to DC, and the first order of business is the State of the Union address."
I was asked by someone after my town hall this Saturday what I hoped to hear from President Trump on Tuesday night.
There are a lot of differences between the residents priorities and mine.
"Having said that, most of the folks I represent want the President to work with Democrats and Republicans to solve some problems."
"In his address, I hope the President outlines some areas where he believes he can work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people."
"In fact, this morning, I joined a number of my colleagues in asking that President Trump address areas where the American people want folks in D.C. to find common ground and make progress, including:   Improving access to quality, affordable health care."
"Unfortunately, the Administration has taken steps that have increased premiums and increased the number of uninsured Americans."
There are opportunities to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and fix elements of our healthcare system that need fixing.
That should be a priority that both parties can get behind.
Following through on a commitment to rebuild Americas crumbling infrastructure.
Its hard for America to compete in a 21st Century economy with 19th Century infrastructure.
"There arent Democratic roads or Republican bridges, so this ought to be an area where the two parties and collaborate."
Prioritizing a future that works for all Americans.
"In the midst of disruptive economic change, its important to ensure that American workers are empowered to navigate those changes rather than be victimized by them."
"Investments in education and training, efforts to increase wages, and strengthening protections for workers can ensure that more people in more places have economic opportunity."
Restoring Americas role in the world.
Its time to reengage constructively with our allies and restore our role as a leader.
That can improve Americas security and economy.
Taking action to build long-lasting solutions to reduce carbon emissions.
The clean energy sector will be a core driver of economic growth and job creation.
"There are a number of common-sense, bipartisan proposals that would represent concrete action to curb carb emissions, spur economic growth and create jobs."
"I feel so strongly about the need to make progress on that last priority, Im bringing a special guest to the State of the Union: Kitsap County resident Mike Kelly."
"Mike, a small businessowner who lives with his family on Bainbridge Island, is the Congressional District Liaison in our region for Citizens Climate Lobby, a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on policies to combat climate change."
Ive been working actively to see the United States take action to step up to the climate crisis.
"Thankfully, Im not alone."
"In fact, folks across our region and across the country are stepping up to raise awareness about the need to act."
"Mike Kelly, local organizers, and the team at Citizens Climate Lobby are helping to lead the way."
Im proud to have Mike attend the State of the Union to continue the call for the President to listen to the American people who are not just demanding action - but leadership - to combat climate change and its impacts.
"We know that if we do this right, we can not only help our planet - we can create quality jobs and sustainable economic growth."
You can read all about what Mikes attendance means to him in the Kitsap Sun.
"There are plenty of policy differences between me and this Administration, but in an era of divided government, progress requires collaboration."
"I hope we hear that commitment to working together from him tomorrow, too."
"Now, on to the news Taking Action to Keep America Safe  In recent weeks, theres been a lot of discussion about rising tensions between the United States and Iran."
"As Ive traveled across our region, Ive heard from folks who are deeply concerned about this escalation - and I share those concerns."
"Ultimately, the American people do not want - and Congress has not authorized - another war in the Middle East."
"Our servicemembers and diplomats who serve there, including the ones I visited in Iraq this past November, deserve a strategy that keeps them safe, enhances our security, and fosters long term stability in the region."
"Last week, Congress passed two bills I co-sponsored to reclaim the Constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and authorize the use of military force, an authority that has eroded over the last two decades."
"You can hear more about that here:    Ensuring Future Generations Never Forget  Every year on Holocaust Memorial Day, we honor the millions of innocent people who lost their lives."
Families across the world have their own stories of this dark chapter in our worlds history.
"This year on Holocaust Memorial Day, which coincided this year with the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the House passed the Never Again Education Act - bipartisan legislation I supported to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America so future generations can continue to learn these stories."
"This bill will provide fundamental resources, education, and training for teachers and students across the country to ensure we continue to educate our communities and future generations on the lessons of the Holocaust - and ultimately promote the importance of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people."
"Continuing the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic  Across our country, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have been one of the leading causes of drug overdoses and fatalities."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 41% of the 70,200 drug overdoses in the United States in 2017 were caused by fentanyl and illicit chemical copycats of the drug, which is 100 times more potent than morphine."
"And in 2018, there were over 30,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths alone."
"In response, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2018 placed a temporary emergency order to classify all fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 drugs (meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use)."
"This temporary order increased restrictions in terms of access, manufacturing, and use - and has led to the supply of new fentanyl analogues dropping by 75 percent."
"Last week, the House took bipartisan action to extend the temporary order on these drugs for 15 more months, overwhelmingly passing the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act."
The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report within 12 months on the public health and safety effects of controlling fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1.
"While its only a temporary solution, its a start."
"Im hopeful that Congress will continue to work to develop common-sense, long-term solutions to the opioid crisis."
Working for You  Honoring Our Veterans  Want to be inspired?!?
Listen to this story...
I recently held a Vietnam Veterans pinning ceremony in Tacoma to say thank you to Vietnam-era vets on behalf of a grateful nation.
"About halfway through the event, we got a call that a group of veterans was on its way from the Retsil Veterans Home in Kitsap County but that they would be an hour late."
"Having already pinned everyone in attendance, I made an announcement that more vets were on the way, and I asked if folks would be willing to stick around to thank the folks who were coming from Retsil."
I was so moved that every single person stuck around.
"One veteran said to me, You know, a lot of us have waited forty or fifty years to get thanked."
I can wait a few minutes to honor these folks coming from Retsil.
It was a real testament to the awesome character of our community - and of the veterans who have served our country.
Im grateful for everyone that came out for this special event.
"Celebrating Team Kitsap  The economic forecast for Kitsap County is bright thanks to the presence of the incredible employers, innovative educational partners, and the economic development A-Team that is the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance."
It was great to join them to talk about opportunities for the future.
Count me as a proud member of Team Kitsap!
Supporting Washingtons Ocean Economy  Im committed to supporting Washingtons ocean economy.
I enjoyed the opportunity to be in Grays Harbor to hear from members of the fishing community and discuss a new bill I introduced to improve the federal fishery disaster process and ensure more timely disaster relief for impacted communities.
Im also working as a member of the Appropriations Committee to restore our salmon populations.
Helping Our Seniors  Seniors today are facing unique challenges.
"Thats why I was grateful for the opportunity to hold a seniors town hall at the Willows Retirement Living in Bremerton to hear from folks and to talk about the work Im doing to ensure Congress protects Medicare  Social Security, lowers the cost of prescription drug prices, and keeps our nations promise to take care of older Americans."
Hearing from You at Town Halls  Speaking of town halls...
"I held a town hall in Suquamish on Saturday where we talked about opportunities to reduce student debt and ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care."
Join me February 10th at 5:30pm PT for a Facebook Live Town Hall.
"Its always important for me to be available, accessible, and accountable to you."
OK - thats it for now folks.
"                                                Dear Friends,  Last week the House took action upholding the separation of powers and exercising its Constitutional responsibility over military action."
"We passed two pieces of legislation that would prohibit federal funds from being used for military action in Iran unless authorized by Congress, and to repeal the 2002 Iraq War Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and prevent it from being used to justify military action towards Iran."
"Meanwhile, in the Senate, following 24 hours of opening arguments from each side and 16 hours of questions, Republican Senators voted to block additional witnesses and documents from consideration in the impeachment trial of President Trump."
"With this vote, the Presidents allies transformed what should have been a full and fair trial in pursuit of the truth into a disgraceful whitewashing of the Presidents wrongdoing."
"I am deeply concerned about precedent the Senates refusal to fulfill its obligations for independence, deliberation and impartiality sets, and the consequences for our Constitutional system of checks and balances."
"The Senators did not just vote to deny witnesses, they sent a message to the current White House and all future Presidents that Congress will not stand up to an Executive that abuses its immense powers for political gain and obstructs Congresss efforts to seek the truth."
"Looking forward, tomorrow the President will deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress."
"At what I consider a moment of great consequence in our nations history, I am please to be joined by social studies teacher, Dr. David Brothman."
Please continue reading below for more on why I invited David as my special guest.
I know a lot is going on in our world but I want to keep this week's letter brief.
"I invite you to join me on Saturday for my next Congress on Your Corner town hall, this time in Winthrop Harbor."
"Please RSVP to let us know you are coming (details and link below), and I look forward to another good conversation."
"Finally, I want to thank everyone who has sent in Valentines cards for our local veterans."
"If you still want to participate, you can drop them off by this Friday, February 7!"
"NORTH CHICAGO CIVICS TEACHER DR. DAVID BROTHMAN IS MY GUEST TO STATE OF THE UNION  Im excited to share that Dr. David Brothman, Social Studies department chair and teacher at North Chicago Community High School, will be my guest at the State of the Union address, scheduled for Tuesday."
"Dr. Brothman is a long-time education leader in the Tenth District, where he has worked in teaching and administrative roles within the North Chicago Community Unit School District 187 since 1999."
"He currently teaches AP Government, AP US History, Civics and Sociology/Psychology."
"Democracy is a verb, and our system of government only works if the next generation of Americans engages as active citizens and voters."
Local educators like Dr. Brothman play a vital role inspiring young people to understand our Constitutional system and their rights and responsibilities as Americans.
"This is a historic and contentious moment for our country, and I hope witnessing this event will be an experience Dr. Brothman is able to share with his students."

Statehood Bill    Congresswoman Norton, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, and House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) announced at a press conference on January 30th that Nortons bill to make D.C. the 51st state, the Washington, D.C."
"51), will be voted on in the Committee at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, February 11."
This vote will be the first congressional vote on the D.C. statehood bill since Norton got the first-ever House floor vote in 1993.
"Once passed by the Committee, H.R."
51 will be ready for a vote on the House floor.
Passing bills on the House floor requires 218 votes.
Nortons bill has 224 cosponsors.
"Norton says she is particularly grateful to Chairwoman Maloney for her support, particularly in granting Nortons request that the Committee vote occur on February 11, the week of the birthdays of both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass."
Lincoln freed D.C.'s slaves before issuing the Emancipation Proclamation for all other slaves in the United States.
Frederick Douglass was a longtime D.C. resident who fought tirelessly for full and equal rights for D.C. residents.

Norton Joins Oversight Subcommittee on Environment    Congresswoman Norton announced that she has joined the House Committee on Oversight and Reforms Subcommittee on the Environment.
"Norton, the second most-senior Democrat on the Committee, now sits on three Oversight subcommittees: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Government Operations, and Environment."
"In Nortons new role, she will help focus the Subcommittee on numerous public health and environmental concerns, including climate change, environmental protection, public lands, endangered species, air and water quality, conservation, energy policy, research and development, and the regulatory affairs of these issues."
"Combatting climate change has long been one of my top priorities in Congress, Norton said."
I hope to bring my experience as the former head of a federal agency to hold this administration accountable for their failure to protect public health and the environment for future generations.
"Norton Introduces Bill to Establish National Effort to Promote Healthy Lifestyles through Nutrition and Exercise    Congresswoman Norton introduced the Promoting Healthier Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise (LIFE) Act of 2020, which would encourage exercise and healthy eating habits nationwide."
"Nortons bill would provide $25 million to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to combat obesity and sedentary lifestyles in three ways: conducting national education campaigns about how to recognize and address overweight and obesity; training health professionals to recognize the signs of obesity early and to educate people concerning healthy lifestyles; and developing intervention strategies to be used in everyday life, such as in the workplace and in community settings."
This initial funding would be only for pilot efforts to develop best practices and give the country a coherent national strategy for combating overweight and obesity.
Reducing overweight and obesity rates has been a priority for Norton in Congress.
"Although her LIFE Act is a national bill, she notes that the District of Columbia has higher rates than many jurisdictions of conditions related to obesity, such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease."
"Adult obesity rates in the United States have more than doubled since 1980, from 15 percent to 35 percent."
Read Nortons full statement here.
Norton Hosts Quarterly Meeting with National Park Service    Congresswoman Norton held a community meeting with the National Park Service (NPS) and D.C. residents at the Cleveland Park Library on January 30th.
Nortons quarterly meetings are an ongoing series for District of Columbia residents and NPS.
"Nortonannounced last Maythat she had gotten NPS to commit to regular public meetings with D.C. residents to hear directly from the community regarding NPS parks, which constitute almost all of the Districts parks, in their neighborhoods."
"NPS is one of my priorities because almost all parkland in the District of Columbia is owned by NPS and funded by the federal government, Norton said."
"Our regular meetings throughout the city have been popular with D.C. residents in ensuring NPS carries out its important local responsibilities, including frequent communication with residents and transparency with them on conditions in our local parks."
"We are pleased that our parks and their upkeep are funded by their owner, NPS."
"Although NPS is not a local agency, when it comes to our neighborhood parks, that is exactly how they must perform."
I am grateful that NPS has agreed to hear from the community on a regular basis to prioritize their needs and concerns.

"            Wickers JROTC Act Provides New Opportunities High School Cadets More Likely to Graduate, Attend College  The experience of serving in Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) programs can have real benefits."
"A Rand Corporation study found that students who participate in JROTC have higher grades, better attendance rates, and are more likely to graduate from high school than other students."
I introduced legislation in 2018 to expand the availability of JROTC programs to more high schools across the country.
The JROTC Opportunities for Transformational Change Act of 2018 authorized funding and reforms to add 100 new units at schools in rural and underserved areas.
The bill was included in the defense authorization act and became law with President Trumps signature.
"Two years later, this law is continuing to expand opportunities for communities and young people."
"I am pleased to report that last years defense bill built on my 2018 proposal by setting a minimum requirement of 3,700 units nationwide in 10 years."
Achieving this baseline will add 188 more units than exist today.
"Each of these new programs will provide young leaders lessons about service, character, and citizenship while encouraging better health and wellness."
Success of Mississippi Cadets Inspires Positive Change  Mississippi is a prime example of the impact a JROTC unit can have on a community.
"In fact, it was the success of students enrolled in JROTC programs in our state capital that originally inspired me to introduce legislation to expand these programs to other schools."
"The Jackson Public School system, a district facing significant challenges, includes seven schools that host JROTC units."
"Across these schools in 2018, 90 percent of graduating seniors who participated in JROTC were accepted to an institution of higher learning and received more than $7.5 million in scholarship offers."
"Outcomes clearly are better for students who participate in these programs, but more programs are needed."
"Before my legislation, funding was flat or declining for JROTC, and hundreds of high schools were on the waitlist for a unit."
We are now closing the gap.
Support for Rural and Underserved Communities  The JROTC Act is also working to improve the availability of enhanced opportunities where they are needed most  in rural and other low-income communities.
Five times as many urban schools have a unit compared to rural schools.
Only three percent of high schools with fewer than 500 students have a JROTC unit.
This divide puts students from rural states like Mississippi at a distinct disadvantage.
"To address this problem, the JROTC Act prioritizes new programs for schools in underserved areas."
"It also gives high schools greater flexibility in hiring instructors, which can often be a challenge in small communities."
"As an ROTC cadet in college, I know firsthand the benefits of a military education experience while in school."
"Numerous other military, business, and government leaders can trace their success to a JROTC or ROTC program, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Housing Secretary Ben Carson, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, entrepreneur Sam Walton, and football legend Lou Holtz."
"                                       This Week in Washington Today, the House impeachment managers and the Presidents defense team will make their closing arguments in the Senates impeachment trial ahead of an expected final vote on Wednesday."
I was extremely disappointed on Friday when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and my Republican colleagues blocked the Senate and the American people from seeing documents and hearing from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the Presidents actions.
This is far from a full and fair trial - and a sad abdication of the Senate's Constitutional duties.
"In the coming days, I will address my colleagues and the American people from the Senate floor on the topic of the Presidents impeachment."
Stay tuned to my Twitter and Facebook pages for more details on the exact timing.
"Also this week, the President will deliver his State of the Union address tomorrow, and Laconia Police Officer Eric Adams will be my guest of honor."
"Officer Adams has gained national recognition for his work as Laconias Prevention, Enforcement, and Treatment Coordinator."
"In this role  the first of its kind in New England  Officer Adams has helped revolutionize the way that law enforcement across the country approach drug addiction and recovery, prioritizing meeting people where they are to help them get the treatment and support that they need to overcome substance use disorder."
"Officer Adams has set an example for our state and our country in bringing an innovative approach to tackling the substance misuse epidemic, helping put countless Granite Staters on the path to recovery."
"As the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid epidemic continues to rage in our communities, I am incredibly grateful for people like Officer Adams who are stepping up to help stem the tide of this crisis."
"I will continue fighting to combat the devastating opioid epidemic by supporting the life-saving efforts of law enforcement, health care providers, and community leaders working on prevention, treatment, and recovery."
"With every good wish,    Senator Maggie Hassan What the Senator is Working On President Trump signed bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Senator Hassan, to codify in law that grant funding to increase security resources for houses of worship and nonprofit organizations must be available for small states like New Hampshire, not just major metropolitan areas."
"Senator Hassan spoke out against the Trump Administrations announcement of new guidance that would allow states to implement Medicaid block grantswhich could dramatically reduce the amount of Medicaid fundingstating that the policy will directly harm children and families, individuals who experience disabilities, seniors, and Americans across the country who depend on Medicaid for their health care coverage."
Senator Hassan wrote an op-ed highlighting the role of craft breweries in New Hampshires economy and her successful efforts to extend tax cuts for the craft beverage industry in the recent bipartisan government funding agreement.
"Photo of the Week As Senator Hassan discussed above, her guest to this years State of the Union Address is Officer Eric Adams of Laconia."
"Officer Adams innovative role as the Prevention, Enforcement, and Treatment Coordinator at the Laconia Police Department is helping law enforcement across the country reshape their approach to tackling the substance misuse epidemic."

"A special thank you to my friend, Dean of the House, Rep. Don Young of Alaska, for introducing the bill along with the original cosponsors."
The four of us represent congressional Districts that look to fishing as a staple of the area economy and a strong local tradition.
"1240 would create a national grant program through the Department of Commerce that  for the first time ever  would support training, education, and workplace development for the next generation of commercial fishermen throughout the country."

"It is a fact that there is travel between China and island nations in the Pacific region, including our closest neighbors in Samoa."
"The Territory was right to alert our medical professionals here in the islands, then make any possible preparations in conjunction with all efforts at the federal level."

"American Samoa Presentation to Vice President Pence  I had the opportunity to present our Territory's wonderful book on American Samoa, by author J. Robert Shaffer, to Vice President Mike Pence in person as a special gift from Governor Lolo and the people of American Samoa!"
The Vice President's own historic visit to American Samoa in 2017 is highlighted in the book on page 273.
"The book fit the theme of the evening perfectly, since the occasion was the swearing-in of President Trump's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders at a White House event in celebration of the Lunar New Year."
"At President Trump's invitation, I serve on the Commission, where I am able to add the viewpoint of an islander living in the islands."
"Also, for the first time, there were three Cabinet members present for the proceeding."

"On Wednesday, President Trump delivered on his promise to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA) and signed into law the much-awaited United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement."
The USMCA delivers on the promise President Trump made to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
"This deal marks a tremendous victory for Pennsylvania workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses."
"It has the potential to create nearly 600,000 jobs and generate up to $235 billion in economic activity."
"In Pennsylvania, trade with Canada and Mexico is essential."
"Over 42,000 jobs depend upon manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico."
The USMCA will provide businesses across the Commonwealth with new opportunities and will create new jobs with family-sustaining wages.
"The signing of the USMCA into law means expanding and opening new market access for our Pennsylvania dairy, egg and poultry producers."
"New markets are welcome news for the nearly 7,000 family-owned and operated farms in PA-11."
"Our farmers in York and Lancaster Counties, who are national leaders in the production of milk and eggs, have only asked for a level playing field which to compete."
"This modern trade deal brings our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico into the 21st century, protecting American intellectual property and ensuring strong, effective protections for innovators and creators."
"I congratulate the President for delivering on his promise, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to implement policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our nation."
"The President and Vice President gave outstanding remarks at the signing of the bill, for those who may have not been able to watch, here is a link to watch the full bill signing."
"Click Here     March For Life  On Friday, thousands of people from across America came to our nations capital to March for Life."
I applaud President Trump for making history as becoming the first sitting president to attend the march.
"In his remarks, he reaffirmed his commitment to implementing pro-life and pro-family policies."
"Since 2017, the Trump Administration has established more conscience protections than ever before."
"While progress has been made, there is still more to accomplish."
"It is always heartening to see so many young adults, families, and college groups come to peacefully demonstrate for the rights of the unborn."
The fight to protect life from conception is one that involves all of us.

"Click Here    Click Here    Click Here    WDAC Weekly Radio Appearance  Click Here     #NeverAgain  January 28th, 2020 marked the 75th year since the liberation of over 7,000 prisoners from the German Nazi Auschwitz camp."
"For nearly five years, these resilient individuals, including 700 children, saw their loved-ones murdered while they endured humiliation, suffering, and pain."
I cosponsored and voted in favor of the bipartisan Never Again Education Act (H.R.
"943), which authorizes funding to be used to develop and nationally disseminate resources to promote understanding about how and why the Holocaust happened."
The education materials will be developed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

WGAL discusses my vote on the bill below.
"Click Here     Democrats Dangerous Attempt To Repeal The AUMF  This week I voted against the House Democrats dangerous attempts to tie the hands of the Commander  in  Chief by repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).At a time when Congress should beprojecting unity in the face of Iranian aggression, House Democratshave advanced a dangerous resolution that ultimately will accomplish nothing but division.Bytaking legal and necessary options off the table for the executive branch, thisamendmentemboldens our enemies andmakesour nation less safe.The safety and security of the American people at home and abroad should be the central focus of our foreign policy."
I strongly oppose this legislation.
"We must keep Americans safe.To read my full statement on this legislation, click here."

"Honoring Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick  This week, Congress honored the life and service of Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick who lost his battle with cancer."
He was a fierce advocate for Pennsylvanias 8th district and he will be missed.

"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                          February 2, 2020 Friday night, in a showing of true cowardice and abdication of duty, Republican Senators voted against subpoenaing key documents and witnesses in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump, effectively condoning the Presidents crimes andthe railroading of our Constitution."
"I believe, and the majority of America knows, thatthis President cant be legitimately acquitted because he never underwent a real trial."
"The sham trial began ominously when Senator Mitch McConnell, in the dead of night, pushedthrough a set of trial rules without guarantees for key witnesses or documents and despite the Trump Administrations blatant obstruction of Congress and the American people from hearing all the facts of the case."
"Nevertheless, the House managers presented a powerful case, proving to the American people that the President must be removed from office for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress."
"As the Presidents defense team presented its arguments, a shocking development heightened the urgent need for witness testimony and documents to be turned over to Congress that thisAdministration refusedto provide."
"Friday night's vote by Republican Senators not to call witnesses and provide the public with a complete and unvarnished accounting of the President's scheme to bribe Ukraine with millions of dollars of badly needed military funding and equipment -- fundsalready approved byCongress -- inexchange for dirt on his politicalrival makes them complicit inthe President'sscheme.Without witnesses or evidence this is not a trial, it's a travesty."
"Republicans in the House and Senatewho have willingly gonealong withthe President'sdefense that anything he does, no matter how criminal or corrupt, is unimpeachable if he says it's in the public's interest has placedour entire system of government, the rule of law, and our Constitution in great peril."
"This is a moment in history that revealedthose whohad the courage and conviction to uphold their duty, and those who cared more about advancing the power of their party and hanging onto their seats."
"Despite this historic low point, the Democratically controlled House continued with criticallegislative business to benefit hardworking Americans and their families.I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to make it easier for military survivors to report sexual assaults."
I also led a letter with 49 of my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women.
"Though the examples are numerous, the letter was promptedin light of his most recent comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing ""a good job"" on a reporter that Pompeoverbally attacked simplybecause she did her job."
"Read below for more details of the week, and make sure to check your inbox for the next edition of Jackie's DC Dashboard."

"Legislative Highlights Impeachment Update: Bolton Bombshell Drops as Senate Heads Toward Critical Vote on Witnesses and Documents It was reported earlier this week that John Bolton, the Presidents former National Security Advisor, wrote in the manuscript for his book that the President told him directly that he was withholding security aid from Ukraine so that he could extract announcements of investigations into his Democratic political rivals."
"On Friday, The New York Times reported that Bolton's manuscript contains details of the President directing Bolton to help with the President's pressure campaignonUkraine, which dangled the promise of a White House meeting and critically neededfunding for the fledgling democracyin exchange for a hit jobon Trumps political rival."
"The article states,Mr."
"Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the presidents personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the presidents impeachment defense."
"That gun isnt just smoking, the barrel isred hot and the trigger is covered with the President's grubby fingerprints."
The Senate trial heads into its finalconclusionnext week followingSenate Republicans voteFriday night against calling fact witnesses or requiring a shred of documentary evidence to be presented.
Rest assured thatmy Democratic colleagues in the House and I will continue to fight the President's and Republicans' attempts to consolidate power in the Executive Branch and their cover-upof his crimesand corruption.
America needs and demands the truth; we will not rest until all the facts are unearthed for the public's view and benefit.
"Introduced Legislation to Make it Safe for Military Survivors to Report Assault On Thursday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague, Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE), to make it easier for sexual assault survivors across the military to report their assailants."
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) expect to introduce companion legislation in the United States soon.
Too many sexual assault survivors in our military and academies hesitate to report attacks because they fear they be punished for minor infractionssuch as underage drinking or curfew violationsthat may be uncovered during the assault investigation.
"Getting survivors to report these incidents so that they can access services and perpetrators can be held accountable is should be the focus of military leadership, not punishment of victims for minor misconduct."
"Our bill will ensure survivors cannot be punished for minor issues when they report an assault, unless aggravating circumstances exist."
The Air Force Academy has already tested this program and seen positive results.
"Survivors and their loved ones should know that will fight hard to pass this legislation in this years National Defense Authorization Act, and that they are not alone."
Sent Letter to the President Condemning his Continuing Degradation of Women a letter to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women.
"The letter was sent on the heels of Secretary Pompeo disparaging NPRs Mary Louise Kelly, a well-renowned journalist, for doing her job when she asked Pompeo about Ukraine."
"Kelly said that Pompeo shouted and swore at her and demanded she find the country on an unmarked map, which she did with no trouble."
Pompeo then barred the reporter from covering his upcoming trip to Europe.
"The next day, President Trump validated this misogynistic and autocratic behavior by stating, you did a good job on her."
"Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, an esteemed career diplomat committed to anti-corruption reforms who the President referred to as the woman who is going to go through some things in the infamous July 25 call with President Zelensky, was yet another casualty."
It is most shameful that the words young girls and boys hear directed at women from the upper echelons of power are dripping with disdain and disrespect.
"It is as if this President relishes the opportunity to publicly humiliate any woman who fights back, speaks up, or takes up space."
"As the women of the DWC admonished him in our letter, the President of the United States should set a moral example for our children, not be the biggest bully on the playground."
"Asked Defense Department About Remedial Action for Whistleblower Retaliation At a hearing this week of the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, we heard from a panel of government officials and experts on the need for stronger whistleblower protections in our laws."
"As Co-Chair of the Houses Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I have long advocated for whistleblower protection laws and have secured crucial legislative victories advancing rights to intelligence and congressional whistleblowers."
"Much of the hearing focused on the huge backlog of 2,500 cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has been unable to function for over a year because President Trump and Senator McConnell have failed to fill seats on the board for quorum."
"I asked Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, why there possibly could be cases of illegal reprisals against whistleblowers that are substantiated during inspector general investigations and yet never result in compensation for the whistleblower."
"Fine agreed with me that there is a disturbing trend of defense agencies essentially ignoring inspector general recommendations to make whistleblowers whole, and that Congress must continue to put pressure and legislate to protect whistleblowers."
"Armed Services Committee Hearing on Security of the Korean Peninsula On Tuesday, I pressed representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Intelligence Agency at the House Armed Services Committees hearing on the lack of a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea."
"The President gave Kim Jong-un multiple PR victories, praising him, meeting with him, and becoming the first U.S. President to set foot in North Korea, raising their global recognition and validating a regime never before recognized by Democratic or Republican Administrations."
None of these displays got us any closer to containing the North Korean threat.
"Now, the Administration claims its applying a maximum pressure campaign."
"However, its also pressuring and disrespecting our allies in South Korea and Japan, demanding outrageous increases to the billions of dollars our allies already contribute annually to our mutual defense."
The Presidents handling of the security region is erratic and dangerous.
We must continue to demand a coherent strategy for dealing with our adversaries and hold this Administrations feet to the fire for the safety and security of the region and our country.
"Oversight Committee Hearing on 75 Years After the Holocaust: The Ongoing Battle Against Hate Tuesday, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Additional hearings will be held in the coming weeks on voter suppression in minority communities, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim discrimination, anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions, and challenges facing LGBTQ individuals."
"As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel, Ill also preside at a hearing next month on the dangers of white supremacist elements in our military."
"Discussion on Poverty in the 21st Century and its Impact on Women As Co-Chair of the Democratic Womens Caucus, I participated in a discussion on modern day poverty and its disproportionate impact on women."
We heard from experts who explained the shocking reality that more people die of poverty in America than heart attacks and cancer combined.
"For millions of Americans, every day is a struggle to avoid eviction, put food on the table, or pay for just one doctors visit."
"Beyond these challenges, many women also take on the dual responsibilities of a traditional job and home and child care."
"This social production work constitutes a second job, but its not adequately valued in our society."
"In a particularly heart-breaking moment, I listened as one mother recounted her daughters struggle with cancer."
"Like many Americans struggling with inadequate health care, her daughter went to an emergency room after discovering a lump in her breast and was turned away without any additional care or tests due to her lack of health insurance."
"After months of no medical care, severe pains forced her back to the ER."
The untreated cancer had spread through her entire body and caused her breast to completely rot off.
"As the wealthiest country in the world, it is a choice  not a forced reality  to not invest in affordable health care for every American."
"Indeed, the mothers home state of Alabama opted out of the Medicaid expansion."
No mother should have to watch her daughter die before her eyes knowing it was avoidable.
"Doubling rates of homelessness, hospital closures to make way for real estate development, and a complete lack of affordable dental care rounded out the discussion and further underscored the inhumane inequality growing in our country."
We must remember that our nations successes cannot be fairly measured without considering everyone that has been left behind.

22 constituents expressed their support for increased consumer safety regulations.
"As an avid proponent of consumer protection, I recognize the importance of improved labeling and consumer education campaigns and have introduced legislation to combat risks ranging from lead-filled childrens glasses to poisonous detergent pods."

"I hope the above photos give you a flavor of the quiet dignity of the place and the weight of the momentthe great rotunda shot from the shadow of Lincolns statue; the view across the rotunda back toward the Senate Chamber which had greeted that solemn procession; the old House Chamber, now Statuary Hall; the main door to the House, overseen by a bust of Lafayette; a downstairs corridor leading back under the rotunda; and as I walked out into the cold night air, the Capitol itself against a dark winter sky."

"            January 31, 2020               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Passing Bill to Fund Holocaust Education    This week, I voted in favor of the bipartisan Never Again Education Act, legislation that will provide teachers throughout the country with the resources and training they need to teach our children the important lessons of the Holocaust."
"I was proud to co-lead this legislation with Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), and managed its passage on the Floor on Monday."
"The bill would amplify the work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, leveraging a combination of public and private funds to develop and disseminate high-quality Holocaust education resources, which can be adopted by local schools and included in their curriculum."
"The bill has the support of more than 1,800 Holocaust survivors from 38 states, as well as 350 organizations from across the country."
"On Monday, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the House reaffirmed its commitment to remembrance by passing this bill to ensure the next generation of students understand the dangers of rising anti-Semitism and recognize that it must never be forgotten."
"As we continue to condemn horrific acts of anti-Semitism across the world, we must also take proactive measures to educate and provide states and schools with the resources necessary to incorporate Holocaust education into their classrooms, ensuring that all students understand the evils of Holocaust and its impact."
"I am honored to co-lead this important legislation, and I applaud my colleagues in the House for its bipartisan passage.Watch my opening remarks on the House Floor in support of this legislationhere and above, and my closing remarkshere."
"Statement on President Trump Signing USMCA Into Law    This week, I proudly attended the signing of the USMCA trade agreement into law by President Trump."
"This is a significant victory for the North Country, and I am thrilled that the USMCA has been signed into law."
"This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy."
It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets.
"I have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers, and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these."
"Advocating for Rural Broadband for the North Country  Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a draft proposal for their new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which rendered all of New York ineligible for the $16 billion allocated in Phase I of the plan to expand high-speed broadband access."
"I called the Chairman of the FCC directly and sent a bipartisan letter with the New York delegation asking them to reverse this decision, and to reiterate the need for underserved areas in the North Country to be included in the funding."
"This week, FCC Chairman Pai sent a letter back to me stating that the proposal will be revised and areas of New York will be considered for Phase I eligibility under the general criteria."
Expanding access to high-speed broadband is critical to the economic well-being of our region.
"The FCC reversing their decision to categorically exclude New York is an important step in the right direction, as this will open the door to much needed investment in the areas of North Country that still lack broadband connectivity."
"However, the FCCs treatment of areas without high-speed access despite some state investment will be central to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund fulfilling its goal of truly closing the digital divide."
I will to continue to work closely with the FCC throughout the development of this important initiative to expand rural broadband access in the North Country.
"Testifying Before Ways  Means Committee on Bipartisan Paid Leave Proposal    This week, I testified before the House Ways  Means Committee in support of H.R."
"5296, the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, legislation I am leading with Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX)."
"This legislation will help working families cover the cost of parental leave, infant care, and other expenses that occur with birth or adoption of a new child by advancing up to $5,000 of their Child Tax Credit."
It is the only bipartisan and bicameral plan to help new parents access upfront financial assistance  and does it without raising taxes or creating new federal mandates.
Developing solutions to help new parents and working families thrive in this modern workforce is necessary for the continued economic success of our nation and the well-being of the next generation of Americans.
I will always advocate on behalf of hardworking North Country families to bring them tangible benefits and enhanced paid leave options as I continue to lead this effort through the House.
Watch my full testimony here and above.
"Cosponsoring Bill Protecting Voter Registration Systems Against Foreign Hacking  This week, I became an original cosponsor of the Protect American Voters Act, legislation to provide states with more adequate resources to secure their current and future election systems."
"This bill updates the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by directing the Election Assistance Commission to issue guidelines for non-voting election equipment, including electronic pollbooks, election night reporting systems, online voter registration systems, and other equipment."
It also establishes the first-ever Election Cyber Assistance Unit to connect local and state election officials with leading election administration and cybersecurity experts from across the country.
"Securing our elections includes prioritizing the protection of voters personal information, which has been at risk to foreign hacking for too long."
"I am proud to cosponsor this bill to ensure election equipment is utilized in a way that protects voter information, and that states are provided with resources and guidance to secure their individual election systems."
"I am a staunch advocate for measures to protect American elections from any foreign interference, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this effort."
"Announcing USDA Primary Agriculture Disaster Designation for the North Country  This week, I announced a USDA Primary Agricultural Disaster designation for all twelve counties in New Yorks 21st Congressional District."
This designation comes after excessive rain and weather events caused massive losses during the 2019 crop year.
"This designation makes farm operators eligible to be considered for certain assistance from the Farm Service Agency (FSA), including emergency loans."
"Farmers in these counties have 8 months from the date of this declaration to apply for emergency loans, and they are encouraged to act as soon as possible.The weather events this past spring, including excessive flooding in many areas, took a toll on farmers across upstate New York."
"I am glad USDA has made this designation and will be offering aid to producers, who are vital to the North Country."
I encourage any farmers who have questions about this application process to reach out to my offices directly.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:     ___________________  Featured Read:  Press Republican -Officials praise signing of USMCA  President Donald Trump's signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law drew praise from organizations and North Country officials."
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville) lauded ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement's (NAFTA) replacement as a significant victory for the region.
"""This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy,"" she said in a statement."
"""It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets."
"I am proud to have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these."""
North Country Chamber of Commerce President Garry Douglas said nothing is more important to the area's economy than its cross-border economic partnership with Canada.
"""With the enactment of the enabling legislation for USMCA, we can expect the continued benefits that will flow from a renewed and predictable economic relationship,"" he said in a statement."
"""The North Country, more than any other area of the U.S., has made itself a uniquely supportive environment for Canadian-based manufacturing in the U.S. market and for cross-border supply chains."""
"Douglas said the North Country's transportation equipment and aerospace cluster is a prime example, with 50 companies employing more than 9,000 people."
New York Farm Bureau President David Fisher said nearly half of the state's agricultural exports go to the country's North American neighbors.
"""Thanks to the presidents signature on USMCA, goods will continue to cross borders to benefit our states farms and rural economy,"" he continued."
"""The agreement provides certainty to farmers as well as opens the door to additional market opportunities, most notably for our dairy farms."""
Douglas and Fisher thanked Stefanik for her support of the agreement's passage.
"""Congresswoman Stefanik has been in the forefront of passage of the USMCA that is essential to balance and strengthen the capability of North Americas competitiveness and enhancing U.S.-Canada economic vitality,"" Canadian/American Border Trade Alliance President/CEO Jim Phillips said."
"Trump, former Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the USMCA on Nov. 30, 2018."
"The Mexican Senate ratified the agreement in June, and in December voted overwhelmingly to accept changes made as a result of negotiations between House Democrats and the White House."

Safe travels back to the Natural State!
"The House convened and voted on a series of bills, including the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act (), the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act (), the Never Again Education Act (), the Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act (), the Global Hope Act (), a Resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests (), the Keeping Girls in School Act (), the Tibetan Policy Support Act (), the Student Borrower Credit Improvement Act (), the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act (), an Amendment to H.R."

"It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!"
"This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month."
David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead.
"They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation."
Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .
Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico  two of Arkansass top trading partners.
"The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity."
"For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs."
"The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this weeks signing delivers a 21stcentury trade framework."
"This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural States world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansass hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families."
"Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansass exports."
"Afrom the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million."
"Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand."
Its exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December.
"By negotiating from strength  the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy."
This landmark agreement puts America first!
I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line.
"Promises made, promises kept!"
The President also announced his .
"The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people."
"With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East."
No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone  and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation.
"On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future."
Centuries of hostilities wont be solved overnight  but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path.
"I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region."
Its noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda.
"While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America."
"The results speak for themselves  thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created."
"In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations."
"We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt."
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory.
"Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year."
"On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic."
It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion.
"Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030."
Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window.
"Our countrys unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt."
"Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030."
"To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget."
"Weve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously."
"Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt."
The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.
"It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them."
Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions  which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country.
"Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesnt appear that well have one this year either."
"In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year."
"Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, were not doing a budget."
It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face.
We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people.
"Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State!"
"I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies."
"I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith  who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association  to discuss the Community Development Block Grant programand other initiatives that support housing and community development."
The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators.
"It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the Universitys priorities."
I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas.
"I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas."
"They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development."
"I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell  and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District."
"My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare."
I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year.
The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief.
"While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House."
"The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence."
"Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient."
"Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith."
The funding  awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA)  will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD).
These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.
Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District.
"This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation."
"By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities."
Wishing you a great weekend!

"The trial began with three days of the House Impeachment Managers making their case for removal, followed by three days of the Presidents attorneys defending him."
Senators then submitted written questions which the Chief Justice read aloud and the House Managers and the Presidents attorneys responded to.
"On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives continued advancing its agenda for the people by introducing and passing bills, holding hearings, and oversight of the Executive Branch."
"As I write this to you, we await the decision of the full Senate as to whether witnesses and documents will be allowed in the trial."
"Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week   CDC Briefing on Coronavirus I met with Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response; and Rear Admiral Denise Hinton with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."
"The coronavirus is a respiratory illness caused by a virus first identified in Wuhan, China."
"Most of the known cases and all deaths associated with the disease have been in China, with only seven confirmed cases in the U.S. to date."
"According to the CDC, the risk to the American public is low, unless someone has recently traveled to Wuhan and is experiencing respiratory symptoms."
"For the latest information about the coronavirus, visit the CDCs website."
"To prevent transmission of diseases, two simple but powerful acts of prevention are recommended."
"Wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly, and cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and everyone should get a flu shot."
"Questioned the CEO of PGE at House Energy and Commerce Hearing on Wildfires  The two most destructive fires in Californian history, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed over 18,000 buildings, were linked to PGEs equipment."
"On January 29th I grilled the CEO of PGE, Bill Johnson, about the utilitys widespread intentional blackouts at a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Environment  Climate Change on the impact of wildfires on the power sector and the environment."
You can watch my questions from the hearing HERE.
Addressing the scourge of wildfires in California continues to be a top priority for me.
"Last October, I introduced the Smoke Planning and Research Act to provide federal funding to help communities research, develop, and implement plans to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke."
Im also pushing hard to strengthen infrastructure to withstand wildfires.
"In July, 2019, I introduced the WIRED Act to allow states to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that will be resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters."
"Currently, states lack this authority and the consequences have been dire."
"Health Subcommittee Hearing on Food and Drug Safety  As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine ten mostly bipartisan bills to improve the safety and transparency in our food and drugs."
Twenty cents out of every dollar spent by American consumers goes toward food or medicine regulated by the FDA.
We examined the FDAs immense mission with two panels of expert witnesses.
Our first panel considered four bills to grant the FDA new authorities to tackle challenges that threaten our drug supply.
"Taken together, these bills improve the drug supply chain from the very beginning to the very end so that patients have access to quality products that are genuine, affordable, and accurately labeled."
The second panel considered six bills that affect the FDAs oversight of food products.
Many of these bills act on decisions that the FDA has long delayed.
"For example, we heard about one bill, the FASTER Act, which would require food manufacturers to list sesame as an allergen on their products."
It would also fund into federal studies to better understand the growing prevalence of food allergies in the United States.
"To watch my opening statement, click HERE."
"Voted YES on the No War Against Iran Act  President Trumps assassination of General Soleimani has placed U.S. service members, diplomats, embassies, and allied interests around the world at high risk, and has brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war."
"To add insult to injury, the President failed to properly consult Congress or seek the legal authority to take military action against Iran."
"The Administration has also failed to fully explain what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the U.S. that required the strike."
"No Member of Congress carries a brief for General Soleimani or the Iranian government, but no President has the unilateral authority to take our nation to war without authorization from Congress."
The No War Against Iran Act underscores that Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Iran.
It also prohibits federal funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.
"Ive long had concerns about the Trump Administrations provocative behavior toward Iran, beginning with the President tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, and its why I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act last April."
My bill restricts this Administration and any future administrations from using any funds appropriated by Congress to take military action in and against Iran without authorization from Congress.
House Infrastructure Package  This week the Majority released our framework for a five-year $760 billion infrastructure bill.
"The framework addresses our nations crumbling infrastructure by investing in zero-emission vehicles, expands access to broadband, upgrades clean water infrastructure, and creates an estimated 10 million new jobs."
"The package also authorizes $12 billion to modernize our countrys 9-1-1 systems, based on my legislation the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act."
You can read more about the infrastructure plan HERE.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Workforce Mobility Act  I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help workers by prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements."
This occurs when an employer restricts an employees future prospects through their employment contracts.
"While California has long prohibited non-competes, 40 percent of Americans have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point in their career."
"Reps. Scott Peters, Mike Gallagher, and I introduced the Workforce Mobility Act to ban non-compete agreements with a few narrow exceptions (such as the sale of a business)."
"Much of Silicon Valley was built by former employees of one tech company leaving to found another, all allowed because of Californias ban on non-compete agreements."
This ban continues to allow the Valley to prosper as an innovation powerhouse.
"Im proud that my legislation will make this a nationwide policy, ensuring all Americans have the ability to innovate."
"The Protecting Community Television Act  Community television is a critical part of our society, giving a voice to nonprofits, artists, schools, local governments, and other community members who otherwise struggle to be heard."
I introduced legislation to ensure that community television operations continue to receive the resources they need to educate and inform viewers in the cities and towns where they operate.
"Today, local governments are permitted to require that cable companies meet community needs by providing in-kind contributions that benefit public, educational, and government (PEG) channels, also known as community television stations."
Unfortunately the FCC proposed regulatory changes that would effectively end the in-kind contributions that support PEG stations.
Senator Ed Markey and I introduced the Protecting Community Television Act to block the FCCs proposal and bolster community TV.
"Weekly Highlights  Meeting with the Foreign Minister of Laos  This week I had the honor of welcoming the Foreign Minister of Laos, His Excellency Saleumxay Kommasith, and the Laotian Ambassador to the U.S., His Excellency Khamphan Anlavan, to my Washington, D.C. office."
"My work to fund the removal of unexploded ordinances, such as landmines in Laos from the Vietnam War era has received bipartisan support in Congress and will save the lives of so many who remain vulnerable to these landmines."
Ive championed this issue by co-leading the Legacies of War Recognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act.
"In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies."
"Over 6,446 constituents have already contacted me in 2020."

"It was an honor to join President Trump at the signing ceremony for this historic trade agreement on behalf of the farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers who rely on a strong trade relationship with our neighbors to the north and south."
"The signing of this agreement signifies President Trump's kept promise to the American people: bringing NAFTA into the 21st Century and finally negotiating an agreement that benefits the United States, creates jobs, and expands access for our high-quality goods and services."

Time to Modernize in ESA   The Endangered Species Act was signed into law 47 years ago with the worthy goal of protecting and revitalizing endangered and threatened animals and wildlife.
"Unfortunately, the outdated law has proved to be a staggering failure for the species it was intended to aid, with only a 3% recovery rate."
Click here to watch my remarks on the House floor.
I hosted a Special Order with my colleagues of the Western Caucus to discuss our ongoing effort to strengthen and modernize the Endangered Species Act by creating a comprehensive approach to advance species recovery.
"By using the best available science, considering all conservation measures, streamlining processes for listing decisions, and empowering state and local efforts to contribute to species recovery, we can fulfill the true intent of the ESA."

Angels in Adoption  A big congratulations to Jake and Angie Moore of Yakima for being named Central Washington's Angels in Adoption for 2019!
"The Moore's have opened their hearts and their home to several foster children in the Yakima Valley, recently finalizing the adoption of their daughter and welcoming a 2-year-old foster son."
"Thank you, Jake and Angie, for all you do to advocate for foster care and adoption and for becoming a family for these children who need a home."
Promoting Services for Domestic Violence Survivors  Did you know the Yakima Police Department responds to 10-12 domestic violence cases per day?

"It's important to teach the next generation about our government in order to have an informed public, and I am proud to be a part of that."
"To stay current on the work I am doing around the District and in Washington D.C., I encourage you to follow me onFacebook,Twitter,andInstagramand to read updateson mywebsite."

"I recently spent the morning with Amelia Toffee, a small (and delicious!)"
"business on Amelia Island, and joined their talented employees hard at work."
"During my visit, I also had the opportunity to make a fresh batch of toffee using locally produced spirits from Marlin and Barrel distillery!"
"Amelia Toffee has benefited from tax reform, and I am committed to continuing my work in Congress to reduce burdensome regulations that stifle economic growth."
Our many unique businesses throughout the First Coast keep our economy thriving and contribute to our flourishing tourism industry.
Thank you to Amelia Toffee and their wonderful team for having me!
"Remembering the Holocaust   This week on Holocaust Remembrance Day, I was proud to support the passage of H.R."
"943, the Never Again Education Act, a bill I cosponsored earlier last year."
"Shockingly, a 2018 study reported that 22 percent of American millennials have never heard of the Holocaust or are unsure of what it is."
"Even more troubling, 66 percent of millennials could not identify Auschwitz as a concentration camp."
The passage of this legislation will ensure future generations remember the horrors of the Holocaust by providing educators resources to teach the events of the Holocaust.
"A society that fails to learn from the past is doomed to repeat it, and it is more important now than ever to impart on younger generations the consequences of hate and intolerance."
Constituent Corner   I am proud of the work my office does every day to help folks throughout the First Coast.
"Recently, we were able to help Callie, an American, reunite with her Swedish husband, Tomas (both pictured above), who was struggling to get timely approval for his immigrant visa from Sweden."
This is just one small example of the numerous services we provide.
"Our talented district caseworkers assist constituents with a wide-range of issues including immigration and veterans affairs challenges, service academy nominations, social security problems, and many more."
"If you believe we can assist you with navigating the federal government, please give our Jacksonville office a call at 904-831-5205."

"Newsletter # This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio On Friday, I released a statement on the ongoing impeachment trial explaining why I will not vote to remove the President -- because doing so would inflict extraordinary and potentially irreparable damage to our already divided nation."
Read my full statement [here](and watch my video message [here]([!
"[](On Friday, I joined Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and other Senate colleagues in sending a letter to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concerning Taiwans exclusion from the World Health Organization and urging the WHO to grant Taiwan observer status."
"On Thursday, the WHO declared the Wuhan coronavirus a global health emergency but has not permitted Taiwan to attend any emergency briefings despite Taiwan having confirmed cases of the coronavirus."
"[](On Wednesday, Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) and I urged President Trump to include $250 million for Everglades Restoration efforts in his forthcoming Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 budget to Congress."
This amount builds off their successful effort to secure $200 million in federal funds for FY 2020 South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER).
"[](On Wednesday, I issued a statement after the Trump Administration announced it will extend sanctions waivers on Iran's civil nuclear program."
"[](On Wednesday, I wrote in the *Washington Examiner* about the need for the United States to do more to support our ally, Taiwan, after the Taiwanese people rejected Beijings authoritarianism and reelected President Tsai Ing-wen to office with historic levels of support."
"[](On Monday, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and I applauded the House passage of our bipartisan Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which will assist veterans re-entering the workforce by directing the National Science Foundation to encourage veterans to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)."
The bill now goes to President Trumps desk to be signed into law.
"[](On Monday, Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and I applauded the passage of the House counterpart to our bipartisan *Never Again Education Act*, which would establish dedicated federal funding to provide teachers with the resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust."
"[](On Monday, Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX), and I sent a letter to the members of the United Kingdoms National Security Council urging them to reject Huawei, a Chinese state-directed telecommunications company, in its 5G infrastructure."
"[](On Wednesday, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I named Hulls Seafood Restaurant and Market of Ormond Beach, FL as the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week."
"James M. Inhofe, US Senator for Oklahoma * INHOFE INFORMANT: Fighting for Life * * * In case you missed it, hundreds of pro-life Oklahomans joined tens of thousands of Americans to march for life last week."
"I was proud to stand with these marchers not only last week, but this week and every week."
Read my entire op-ed on why we must continue to fight for life in the Oklahoman here [link 1] and below.
"[image = Inhofe in the Oklahoman: The war on the unborn: We must keep fighting* * If you watch the liberal news media today, you would think no one is advocating for the unborn or standing up for the right to life."
Thank goodness the media has it wrong.
Support in the United States for the pro-life position is strong.
A recent Gallup poll showed 50% of Americans consider abortion morally wrong.
"For the first time since 2013, more Americans are pro-life (49%), rather than pro-abortion (46%)."
Other polling has found that the majority of Americans don't support taxpayer-funded abortion.
"By highlighting the value of all human life, we're making progress to end the abortion on demand culture."
But the fight isn't nearly over.
Liberal states are continuing to push for more and more extreme abortion laws.
New York and Vermont have enacted laws that will allow abortion up to the moment of birth.
"Illinois passed a law making abortion a ""fundamental right"" and explicitly stating that unborn children do not have rights."
The abortion-on-demand industry has no respect for the dignity of human life.
"Last year, authorities discovered more than 2,000 aborted fetal remains in the home of a deceased abortion doctor from Indiana."
The evidence is clear: We must fight every day so abortion doesn't claim any more unborn babies.
"When you are pro-life, you believe every life is a gift from God that begins at conception -- no matter what."
That means you believe in the value and future potential of every child.
"Sadly, not everyone sees that."
Case in point: Over two-thirds of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted in the United States.
I introduced legislation to prohibit abortion based on a Down syndrome diagnosis.
"I also have cosponsored several key pro-life bills, including the Life at Conception Act, which recognizes that life begins at conception, and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization."
"On top of efforts in Congress, we have the most pro-life president in history."
We have worked together to guarantee that federal tax dollars can't go toward abortion by protecting the Hyde Amendment and reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy.
"We have also stripped abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, of using federal Title X funding for abortions."
"Just this month, I joined more than 200 of my colleagues in urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade."
This would be a huge win for life.
"But, as we see with New York, Vermont and other states, when we make progress in Washington by standing for life, liberal states try to roll back those protections."
That's why the work of Oklahomans for Life and events like Rose Day at the state Capitol are so important.
Oklahoma is also consistently ranked as one of the top ten states most protective of life.
"This week alone, hundreds of pro-life Oklahomans will join tens of thousands of Americans who are marching for life."
I'm proud to stand with these marchers this week and every week.
"We know that as we keep fighting for what is right, we will not be overcome."
"Rather, we will overcome evil with good by upholding and affirming the dignity and inherent worth of every human being."
We will keep fighting.
"*Inhofe, R-Tulsa, is Oklahoma's senior U.S."
"                               This week Senator Rick Scott continued releasing episodes of his Lets Get Back to Work video series, featuring Floridianshighlighting everything Congress is not getting done for the American people throughout the impeachment trial, like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, passingNo Budget, No Payand securing the border."

Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Passage of Resolution Recognizing National School Choice Week   Senator Rick Scott joined his colleagues in celebration of the passage of the resolution declaring this week as National School Choice Week.
"Senator Rick Scott said, Im proud to join Senator Tim Scott and my colleagues to recognize National School Choice Week."
"As a father and grandfather, I know firsthand that every child learns differently and should have the opportunity to attend a school that best fits their needs."
"Thats why, throughout my time as Governor, I worked to make Florida a national leader in school choice, and as Senator, Im working to build on these efforts to help our students succeed.Read more from Senator Tim Scott's HERE."

"Senator Scott introduced the American Security Drone Act of 2019, which prohibits the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and China."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, Im glad to see the Department is putting national security first and adopting a no-fly rule for drones made in Communist China."
The Trump administration sees the risks associated with using taxpayer dollars to purchase tech from a Communist government that is trying to spy on us.
This is great news for our security.
"Now, we must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants."
We must take the threat from Communist China seriously.Read more HERE.
Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Urge President Trump to Include $250 Million for Everglades Restoration in Budget  Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio in a letter to President Trump urging him to include $250 million for Everglades Restoration in his Fiscal Year 2021 budget requests to Congress.
"This funding would build on the $200 million in construction funding for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Senator Scott, Senator Rubio and Governor Ron DeSantis fought for and secured last year, as well as the $2 billion in state funding invested in restoring the Everglades throughout Senator Scotts time as Governor."
"Read more, including the full letter, from SenatorRubio's office HERE."

"Read more, including the full letter, HERE."

"Since the Peace Corps announced its decision to wind down operations in Communist China this month, the Director has refused to take a meeting with the Senator to discuss next steps."
"This decision follows months of Senator Scott calling for the Peace Corps to get out of Communist China, and the introduction of Senator Scotts Peace Corps Mission Accountability Act, which prohibits all Peace Corps activity in hostile countries, including Communist China."
"Read more, including the full letter, HERE."
"Senator Rick Scott: If Anyone Supports Maduro, I Wont Stay Quiet  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement after the law firm of Foley  Lardner heeded the Senators call to drop its client, Inspector General Reinaldo Muoz, the top lawyer for Nicolas Maduros brutal regime in Venezuela."
"Senator Rick Scott said, This week, I raised questions about the $12.5 million Foley  Lardner received to represent the illegitimate Maduro regime and announced that I would no longer meet with anyone from that firm."
Im glad they made the right decision to drop the Maduro regime as a client and return the money.
Its unfortunate they made the decision to give this murderous dictator legitimacy in the first place.
I would recommend to Foley  Lardner that they get involved in support of the people of Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro is perpetrating a genocide on the people of Venezuela.
Ive been to the border between Venezuela and Colombia.
I met young mothers who trek hours through the jungle just to get their only meal of the day.
I met children who travel through FARC-controlled territory to Colombia to go to school  the only way they can get an education.
"Thousands have died, millions have fled, and Maduro and his cronies have gotten fat and rich."
"I hope the last few days will serve as a lesson to any other lobbying firms, consultants or organizations that if you support Maduro and his gang of thugs, I wont stay quiet.Read more HERE."
"Senador Rick Scott: Si alguien apoya a Maduro, no me quedar callado  El senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaracin luego de que el bufete de abogados Foley  Lardner respondiera al llamado del senador de abandonar a su cliente, el inspector general Reinaldo Muoz, el principal abogado del brutal rgimen de Nicols Maduro en Venezuela."
"El senador Rick Scott dijo: Esta semana, hice preguntas sobre los $12.5 millones que recibi Foley  Lardner para representar al rgimen ilegtimo de Maduro y anunci que no me reunira con nadie de esa firma."
Me alegra que hayan tomado la decisin correcta de abandonar al rgimen de Maduro como cliente y devolver el dinero.
Es lamentable que hayan tomado la decisin de dar legitimidad a este asesino dictador en primer lugar.
Le recomendara a Foley  Lardner que se unan en apoyo al pueblo de Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro est perpetrando un genocidio contra la gente de Venezuela.
He estado en la frontera entre Venezuela y Colombia.
Conoc a madres jvenes que caminan durante horas por la jungla solo para obtener su nica comida del da.
"Conoc a nios que viajan a Colombia a travs del territorio controlado por la FARC para ir a la escuela, la nica forma en que pueden obtener una educacin."
"Miles han muerto, millones han huido y Maduro y sus amigos se han engordado y enriquecido."
"Espero que los ltimos das sirvan como una leccin para cualquier otra firma de cabildeo, consultores u organizaciones que si apoyan a Maduro y su banda de matones, no me quedar callado "".Lea ms AQU."
"Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration For Heeding His Call to Declare Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trumps decision to declare the 2019 Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States, and announcement that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended entry into the United States."
This decision follows Senator Scotts call last week for the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.
"Last Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agencys plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Last week, I called on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States, and I am glad they heeded that call today."
"Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy."
"We still need to take additional steps to protect Americans, including increased screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China."
China needs to do more to keep the world community accurately informed about the spread of the virus and follow Americas lead to ground Chinese commercial flights.
"Sen. Rick Scott Warns UK: Allowing Communist China in Your Networks is a Mistake  Ahead of the United Kingdoms decision to allow Huawei, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China, to build part of its 5G infrastructure, Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner warning the U.K. about the extreme risks associated with this decision."
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, Johnson and other U.K. leaders must be extremely careful when it comes to the threat of communist China and the implications for the United States relationship with the U.K."
"Put simply, the U.K. allowing Huawei to gain a foothold would be a grave mistake."
Huawei is a bad actor across the globe.
"Its a company that aids the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights, steal our data, technology, and intellectual property, and build up their military to compete with us and other freedom-loving countries."
Countries that do business with Huawei eliminate their citizens and their countrys privacy rights.
Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party are one and the same.
"If the U.S. is going to consider a trade agreement with the U.K., it is imperative that Huawei is recognized as a threat to our national security partnership."
The U.S. must put any trade deal with the U.K. on hold until Johnson commits to take swift action to ensure Huawei will not be used in their transition to 5G networks.
This is for the security of both the U.S. and the U.K.  Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.
Sen. Rick Scott: Peace Corps Needs to Stop Wasting Taxpayer Dollars and Get Out of Communist China Immediately  Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent op-ed on the Peace Corps decision to end its programs in Communist China.
Senator Rick Scott also sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China.
"In the letter to the editor, Senator Rick Scott wrote, Ive met with the Peace Corps director multiple times and asked her what the volunteers did in Communist China and why they were there."
"When I asked what the return on investment was for the U.S. taxpayers, the director (shockingly) had no answer."
The Peace Corps finally came to its senses this month and said it is leaving Communist China.
"Since then, the director has refused to meet with me."
"I would love to hear its plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China, but Im not holding my breath."

Florida is home to the best airport in the nation!
"This week, Orlando International Airport was ranked the best large airport by USA Todayin its 10 Best Readers Choice travel awards."
"          A message from Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke         Dear Friends, With assaults on our democracy, our values and our community coming daily, its easy for citizens to get discouraged, but as the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said: You dont make progress by standing on the sidelines."
"After reading this 2019-in-review District update, it should be clear, were not surrendering."
"In fact, just the opposite: Were fighting on many fronts to ensure our federal government serves all the residents of Central Brooklyn with fairness, dignity and respect."
Its an honor to serve as your representative in the United States House of Representatives.
"Each day, the residents of the 9th District inspire me to represent Brooklyn everywhere I go and to be a champion for issues that impact our community."
"I am proud that my constituents are focused on assisting those in need, creating opportunities for all to succeed and developing sustainable communities."
"Please subscribe to my eNewsletter, visit my website and follow me on social media to stay up to date and to let me know how I can be of assistance to you."
"Warm regards, Yvette D. Clarke         Housing remains an essential issue for central Brooklyn residents."
Lack of affordable housing is a major barrier to pursuing the American Dream and is at the forefront of the issues I am working to solve.
"Home and rent prices have skyrocketed, pricing low and middle-income families out of the market."
These high prices discourage those who are trying to move into Brooklyn and are a strain on those who are already living here.
"Thats why Ive introduced two pieces of legislation to address the affordable housing crisis in Brooklyn, the Affordable Housing and Area Median Income (AMI) Fairness Act and the Hardest Hit Housing Act."
"The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act, will bring some much-needed coursecorrection to curb rental rates that have disproportionately ballooned over the years for Brooklynites and for hard-working people who call other cities home."
"In addition to reforming AMI, The Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act takes significant steps to empower municipalities, increase developer transparency and bolster the supply of affordable housing for Americans across the country by creating over 350,000 new units of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
"The Hardest Hit Housing Act would provide additional funding for the Capital Fund, which provides funds to Public Housing Agencies for development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments."
The bill also provides funding for mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance and for incremental rental assistance vouchers.
Such funding will hopefully prevent those from foreclosing their homes and will assist those who are financially struggling.
Being safe in your home means not acting as a guinea pig for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings.
I introduced the No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act.
"This legislation was inspired by tenants at Atlantic Towers, a rent-stabilized community in Brownsville, who spoke out against their landlord who wanted to install facial recognition technology in their apartment complex."
My bill would protect public housing residents from being subjected to biometric technologies in their homes.
New York residents should not have to act as guinea pigs for emerging technologies that have proven shortcomings and negative impacts on communities of color.
"In Washington, I am proud to be a leader in the fight against what I believe to be the Presidents anti-immigrant agenda."
"My bill, the Dream and Promise Act, (H.R."
6) passed in the House of Representatives last year.
"6, this bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 2.5 million Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforcement Departure (DED) Recipients, as well as DREAMers."
"As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Immigration Task Force, I am working to provide fair solutions to protect immigrant communities across America."
"Due to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I also introduced the Temporary Protected Status for Victims of Hurricane Dorian Act to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Bahamian nationals seeking refuge."
"Standing shoulder to shoulder with fellow public officials, including four members of Congress from New York City, and immigrant-rights activists, I hosted a press conference in Foley Square to focus on what I believe to be the Presidents xenophobic ICE raids and their effect on New York City to educate the public about their rights as immigrants."
"As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus newly formed 2020 Census Task Force and the Representative of one of the hardest to count districts in the country, Im committed to making a difference with the 2020 Census by helping educate about the power of filling out the census."
It was important to me to convene my two Immigration and Census town halls to focus on the critical issues facing members of our community.
We must work together to emphasize the power of filling out the Census accurately so Central Brooklyn receives the necessary federal resources to thrive.
Funding for community resources like hospitals and schools are directly tied to Census counts.
"Essential to the functioning of our government is the understanding that no person is above the law, not even the President of the United States."
I led both a District town hall and a telephone town hall to discuss the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.
I believe the evidence suggests that the President engaged in exactly the types of egregious behavior our founders were most concerned by: bribery and abuse of power.
"In the coming weeks and months, Congress will consider new evidence that will be made publicly available to the American people."
"As an early proponent of the impeachment of President Trump, I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues in Washington, DC to put our country before partisan interests."
"Whether at home in Brooklyn or in Washington, DC, I am leading the effort to address climate change with the goal of ushering in a future of climate-resilient smart cities."
"Through my work as Vice Chair of the Energy  Commerce Committee and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am striving to tackle climate-warming emissions and protect us from future climate impacts."
I introduced The FEMA Climate Change Preparedness Act (H.R.
"4823) to better protect all Americans, especially vulnerable communities, from the short- and long-term threats that climate change poses to our homes, communities and critical infrastructure."
My DHS Climate Change Research Act (H.R.
4737) was passed by the House Homeland Security Committee.
This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct research and take action to confront the effects of climate change on Americas national security.
"This summer alone, over 30 thousand Brooklyn residentsmany in the Ninth Districtwere left without power for multiple days when extreme heat caused our critical power equipment to fail, despite assurances from Con Edison that they were prepared."
I have been working with Con Edison to make sure a similar outage doesnt happen again.
Brooklyns communities deserve a smart and resilient electric grid that is prepared to meet the threats and demands of the 21st Century.
"To address this issue, I convened a climate-resilient smart cities roundtable discussion in Central Brooklyn."
"With a panel of local climate and environmental experts, the discussion focused on planning and building sustainable, climate-resilient smart cities."
"As a firm believer in Congress ability to come together and combat this nations contributions to climate change, I am also a proud original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation."
I am proud that my bill H.R.
"5328 passed into law, in honor of my predecessor, the late Congressman Major Owens, known as the father of progressive politics of Central Brooklyn."
My bill renamed the post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in his name and convened the Brooklyn community and public officials to celebrate his legacy.
Congressman Owens was a fierce social justice fighter and championed progressive issues until his retirement from Congress in 2007.
"At the dedication of the post office, I discussed the concerns of numerous constituents who have been inconvenienced by the long wait hours in line at their local post offices due to understaffing."
Many of my constituents have also reported that they are not receiving their mail in a timely fashion or at all.
"In Major Owens honor and legacy, I am working with our postal service to make sure we quickly find solutions, so people throughout the Ninth Congressional District can again have confidence in using the postal service for the important issues impacting their daily lives."
My Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and I wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand he immediately passes H.R.
"8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and H.R."
"1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act."
Both these bipartisan bills were passed by the House in February of last year and have been blocked for a vote by McConnell.
This inaction is unacceptable.
The fact is: background checks save lives.
Every day background checks prevent more than 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from accessing guns.
Any delay to pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation only increases the chances that even more innocent Americans could suffer from the tragic and needless loss caused by gun violence.
"I am also a co-sponsor of The Assault Weapons Ban, H.R."
"1296 to make it a crime to knowingly import, sell or possess semiautomatic assault weapons."
The Keep Americans Safe Act which prohibits the possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition and the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow families or law enforcement to go to court to seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily prohibit someone who poses a threat to themselves or others from obtaining a firearm.
"From the recent episodes of gun violence harming our community in both Brownsville and Crown Heights, it is clear that Congress must work together to end gun violence."
"Im proud that my bill, the Ending One-Ring Scams Act, passed the House of Representatives as part of the TRACED Act to stop bad robocalls."
"If youve had a missed call from an unknown number and decide to call it back, only to learn it was a robocall, the robocaller can then collect fees from cell phone carriers."
"These incurred fees then trickle down to consumers, like you, on your cell phone bills."
I know robocalls are more than annoyingtheyre costly.
"My legislation, the Ending One-Ring Scams Act."
will end these one-ring scams through a series of safeguards and actions from the government.

"Vern    Congressional delegation to tackle spike in Florida human trafficking Jacob Ogles  In one ranking no one will brag about, Florida ranks third in the nation for reported human trafficking cases."
"As Floridas Congressional Delegation met for the first time in 2020, the topic drove the agenda."
"Human trafficking is a vile crime against children and women that flourishes in the dark shadows of society, said Rep. Vern Buchanan, Delegation co-chair."
"We need to bring it into the light, expose these atrocities and end what amounts to modern-day slavery."
Executives from Sarasota-based Selah Freedom flew to Washington to press for action.
"Elizabeth Fisher Good, the organizations founder, testified that early education must be part of any effort to reduce human trafficking."
"She said there must also be an awareness of online activity, a ubiquitous part of the modern teenage experience."
"1 out of 9 children are now approached on social media, Fisher Good said."
It isnt stranger danger anymore.
Thats why education starting in kindergarten is vital.

"                                 Dear Lindsey,  Across the United States, 240,000 students have been deceived or defrauded by failed for-profit colleges and appealed to the federal government for debt relief."
"1,000 of these students are from Connecticut."
"In September 2019, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released a rule aimed at rolling back borrower defense protections, which allows students to receive loan forgiveness when they have been victims of predatory for-profit colleges, such as Corinthian or ITT Tech."
The rule creates a new three-year time limit for borrowers to submit loan forgiveness claims.
It also requires defrauded students to prove personal financial harm in order to access relief.
"In addition, the rule requires the Department of Education to review every case individually, even if the institution had already been proven to have engaged in misconduct."
I voted with mycolleaguesin the House of Representatives to overturn the Department of Education's ruleand stand up for students defrauded by for-profit colleges throughout the United States.
"I fought for this resolution to protect students from institutions which award degrees that have no value, insurmountable debt, and no means of accessing justice."
"On December 12, 2019, the HouseCommittee onEducation and Labor held a hearing examining the Department of Educations implementation of Borrower Defense."
"During this hearing, I pressed Secretary DeVos on her efforts to undermine this vital policy."
I will always advocate on behalf of our nation's hardworking students.
"Last year, I introduced legislation to make it easier for students defrauded by closed institutions to qualify for loan forgiveness."
