"While Congress holds the Article I powers of the Constitution, or the power of the purse, the Presidents budget outlines his vision for the nation.The release of the Presidents budget request historically kicks off the congressional budget process in both the House and the Senate."
It serves as a starting point for lawmakers to make spending decisions and analyze the economic outlook for the coming year.
The framework of the budget process can be divided up into :   President submits the budget to Congress House and Senate mark up and pass budget House and Senate conference the budget resolution Consideration and passage of Appropriations bills Consideration of reconciliation/authorization Start of new Fiscal Year (October 1st)   I applaud President Trump for putting forward a budget proposal.
"Thats more than we can say for the Peoples House, where, for the second straight year, the Democrat majority has failed to produce a budget."
Thats not leadership.
"This is interesting to me because, on the House Budget Committee majoritys website, there is a section titled Responsibility."
"The first sentence in this section reads, The Committees chief responsibility is to draft an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that provides a congressional framework for spending and revenue levels, the federal surplus or deficit, and public debt."
"In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done."
"Yet, here in the House, in the greatest country in the world, were not doing a budget."
"Simply put, a failure to budget is a failure to govern."
"We must start doing our job to put our country on a sustainable, responsible fiscal path."
"This is our duty to the American people, not promoting budget-busting policies, including Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, that will leave future generations saddled with the consequences of House Democrats eagerness to spend with no way to pay."
Its time for Democrats to stop punting one of our most basic responsibilities in Congress.
Im ready for them to join us at the table to do the difficult work.
While we cant analyze the Democrats budget  because they wont put one forth  the House Budget Committee did hold a hearing on the Presidents FY 2021 budget proposal withOMBActing Director Russell Vought.
"As we discussed, the proposal seeks to balance our fiscal constraints with the need to fund the priorities of the country, including national defense."
"The Presidents budget includes deficit reduction measures, specifically $4.6 trillion between 2021-2030."
"This is a strong start, but more work remains to be done to put our country on a solid fiscal path."
"Moving forward, it is imperative that we work together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to advance a budget that funds our nations important priorities while acknowledging our very real fiscal challenges."
You can read my full opening remarks .
"MEETINGS  In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State!"
"It was a pleasure to meet with Keturah Finch and Tanner Arnwine of Bentonville to talk about neurofibromatosis(NF), a genetic, tumor-generating disorder."
"We discussed research through the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) and the National Institutes of Health, as well as its value to civilians, warfighters, and veterans suffering fromNF."
"Novel research has led to a new era of medical breakthroughs for a variety of illnesses, but there is still much more work to be done across many fields."
"We must continue to make smart investments that build our pipeline of science, research, and medical discovery."
"The next morning, I invited my Republican House Budget Committee colleagues to join me at the Office of Budget and Management to hear more about the Presidents recently released budget proposal, as well as fiscal priorities of the White House."
"As I mentioned earlier, I appreciate the Administration for drafting a budget."
"Congress should be doing the same thing, but House Democrats have refused to put forth a proposal yet again."
"In the real world, everyday Americans and Arkansans are held accountable for their income, expenses, and savings."
"Main Street job creators and business leaders are held accountable for demonstrating fiscal restraint, for making tough choices, and for setting priorities."
Congress should not be any different.
"But in the House, Democrats are refusing to put forth the very document that tells us what we need to know about how much were spending, what were raising in revenue, and the impact of our deficits and debt on our economy and the nation."
The American people deserve better.
"Representatives from NorthWest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) were in Washington, and I had the opportunity to hear some important school and curriculum updates."
"We talked about enhancing Career and Technical Education (CTE), the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act  which I voted for  and the National Science Foundations Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program."
"NWACC just received an ATE grant for a project that will create a Technical Certificate in Integrated Design to help expand the skilled technical workforce, especially in construction fields and engineering design."
"NWACC is helping prepare our students for the jobs of today and the future, and I appreciate their dedication to providing quality education and opportunities in the Third District."
"I thank Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson, Dr. Ricky Tompkins, Jim Hall, Rachel Harris, and DeAnne Witherspoon for their time and work!"
I then met with the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police.
I always appreciate meeting with our law enforcement officers and hearing more about their work to protect and serve our communities.
"We discussed many issues, including The Protect and Serve Act (HR 1325)."
"Im a cosponsor of this legislation, which creates new federal penalties for individuals who deliberately attack or attempt to cause significant bodily injury to any law enforcement officer."
This bill aims to deter attacks against police officers who have increasingly been targeted and face higher levels of hostility because of the uniform they wear.
Im extremely thankful for the work of the men and women who wear the badge each day!
My next meeting was with the Enlisted Association of the Arkansas National Guard.
"It was wonderful to sit down with Arkansas National Guard members from Fort Smith and other parts of the state to talk about their work, duties, and programs that support their efforts."
We also had a productive discussion on the National Guards role going forward in the Space and Cyber domains.
The Arkansas Air National Guard has both Space and Cyber missions.
"As a 30-year veteran of the Arkansas ArmyNational Guard, I salute their service and thank them for their commitment to the Natural State and our nation!"
"I then welcomed Dr. John Lorsch, Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, to my office to speak about the Institutional Development Award (IDea) program and its impact on Arkansas."
Our conversations focused on the NIHs research and biomedical investments within the Natural State.
"I wrapped up the day at the National Guard Association, where I joined National Guard members from across the country to talk about defense efforts, legislative advocacy, and my work on the House Budget Committee."
"I shared stories about my time in uniform, as well as my perspectives on appropriations work in Congress."
"I talked about the constrained resource environment we face, and how growing mandatory spending is squeezing the portion of discretionary funding available for national priorities."
"The Guard brings great value to the fight, and it was my honor to talk to this great group and answer questions."
"The next morning, I met with Dan Hendrix, President and CEO of the World Trade Center Arkansas."
"I appreciated an update on their work, economic development in the community, small business grants, and the impact of recent trade deals on the state."
"Arkansas is a state of opportunity, and the World Trade Center Arkansas is a pivotal resource that has supported bilateral trade services, global connections, and export development programs for local businesses."
"Our region is full of opportunity, and it was great to speak with students from the Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program."
FLEX students spend an academic year in the U.S. living with a volunteer host family and attending high school.
"The students, who are from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are currently living and going to school in Russellville and Springdale!"
They said that they have learned a lot during their time living and studying in the region  and that they love the sense of community in Arkansas!
Modernized infrastructure is vital to keeping our communities economically competitive and strong.
"It was great to wrap up my week in Washington with Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.We had very productive conversations on rural infrastructure grants, local projects like I-49 and regional airport improvements, and budget and appropriations.We also highlighted the importance of addressing U.S. infrastructure needs using smart and effective methods that provide results and maximize our resources."
"Today, I also want to wish everyone  especially my wonderful wife, Terri  a Happy Valentines Day!"
I'm grateful that my office was able to present some special valentines to residents at Methodist Village Senior Living in Fort Smith.
Spreading some cheer and happiness is what this day is all about!
Im looking forward to being back in the district and traveling the Natural State next week.
Wishing everyone a Happy PresidentsDayon Monday!
Let us reflect and honor the leaders who've held our nation's highest office to serve the American people.
"By swearing an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, they each answered the call to lead our great country throughout history."
"From George Washington to Donald Trump, Happy Presidents' Day to all our leaders  past and present!"

"Latest News Impeachment is finally over After more than four long, divisive and counter-productive months, impeachment is finally over and the president has been rightfully acquittedthe actions of the president did not warrant the charges."
Congress has been stuck at a standstill for too long.
"Having been sworn into Congress only a week prior to the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, I am thankful this storm has passed and I can finally begin the legislative work eastern North Carolinians elected me to do."
"Congress could and should have been working on issues like healthcare, prescription drugs, border security and more instead of this tiresome and illegitimate impeachment."
"Hopefully, we can finally get back to tending to the business of the people."
"Unfortunately, I doubt that will be the case after the petty and partisan theatrics displayed by Speaker Pelosi at the State of the Union address."
Bipartisan efforts that would benefit the American people will likely be forgone due to the Speakers disdain for the president and her fear of giving him legislative victories.
America deserves better.
What's going on with coronavirus?
"As a physician and member of Congress, I wanted to give you all an update on the status of the coronavirus and how the United States is working to combat its spread."
Watch the video below to learn more.
Surprise billing There is bipartisan agreement that surprise billing is a major problem for patients and families across America.
It desperately needs to be addressed.
While Im glad we discussed the best path forward to alleviate the problems of surprise billing during a markup of H.R.
"5800 in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week, this legislation is not the right solution to this problem."
Even though I couldn't support H.R.
"5800 in its entirety, I was glad to improve it with two amendments that were adopted unanimously."
"As a physician, I'll continue to utilize my expertise on these issues to lower the cost of healthcare and increase patient access to provide Americans with the greatest treatments possible."
"Watch my opening statement below: Veterans HOPE Act Last week, I was proud to introduce the Veterans HOPE Act to prevent opioid overdose deaths among veterans."
"Between 2010 and 2016, deaths due to opioid overdose rose by 65% among veterans."
"During those same years, veteran deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by roughly five-fold."
"Meanwhile, the rate of prescription opioid receipts within three months before death declined by more than 25%, suggesting that opioid overdoses are likely stemming from hard or synthetic drugs, without knowledge of the initial prescriber."
"To combat this issue, the Veterans HOPE Act would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to further investigate deaths caused by heroin and synthetic opioids."
"Upon conclusion of the study, the Secretary would report findings to the public and Congress and suggest veteran overdose prevention efforts to save lives."
"As a member of the North Carolina State Assembly, authoring the main legislative actions to combat the opioid crisis in North Carolina was one of my proudest achievements."
"Now as the U.S. Representative of a Congressional District with the fifth most veterans in America, the Veterans HOPE Act is especially important research to me."
The data speaks for itselfveteran deaths caused by non-prescribed opioids like heroin and fentanyl have skyrocketed.
But our veterans are more than a statistic.
"They are sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers who have selflessly sacrificed so much for our great nation."
It is our duty to do all we can to protect them from the dangers of opioid addiction.

"District Highlights George Henry White Commemorative Stamp Act Honored to introduce legislation this week alongside several of my North Carolina colleagues to honor George Henry White of New Bern, a Republican politican and the last black member of Congress during Reconstruction."
"George Henry White courageously stood up to racial injustice in a hostile time period for African Americans, especially in the South."
The cause of Civil Rights in this country was only advanced because of strong and brave leaders like him.
It was only fitting that we honor such a historic African American figure during Black History Month.
You can read more about his life and legacy here.
"Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office Almost one year after Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.'s passing, Im pleased that a bill I introduced in his honor advanced through the House of Representatives."
"This measure would designate a post office in his hometown of Farmville, the ""Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office."""
"It was altogether fitting that my first piece of legislation as a member of Congress be a tribute to my predecessor, friend and mentor."
"Walter cared deeply for the people of eastern North Carolina, especially the Marines who serve at Camp Lejeune, Cherry Point and New River."
He epitomized what a public servant stood forhis constituents.
"I greatly appreciate my colleagues in the North Carolina delegation for unanimously supporting this bill, and I hope the Senate and President Trump will swiftly act to make this bill a law."
You can watch my remarks from the House floor in support of the bill below: Christina Koch Returns to Earth Congratulations to Christina Koch for completing her 328 day mission in space!
Welcome back to planet Earth!
Christina grew up in Jacksonville and attended NC State.
Her time aboard the International Space Station set the record for the longest single continuous spaceflight by a female.

"Welcome home, Christina!"

We have helped stressed areas of our country by raising people out of poverty with jobs and pride.
So much better than creating more government dependency.
I will continue to support this administration and its pro-growth policies while serving the great people of eastern North Carolina.
"It was great meeting with Winston Salem Special Olympics athlete, Jennifer Wardlow, and President and CEO of Special Olympics North Carolina, Keith Fishburne."
The Special Olympics is a truly fantastic organization.

Had a productive discussion with representatives from National Rural Health.
"Access, equity and quality of healthcare are especially important issues in places like eastern North Carolina."

"We passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act while I was Governor and now Im fighting for improvements on the federal level, including the Luke and Alex School Safety Act."
"While our hearts are still heavy with loss we cannot undo, we must do everything in our power to honor the memory of the victims and ensure no family has to go through this pain again."

Sen. Rick Scott Calls on General Secretary Xi to Extradite Perpetrators of the Equifax Breach  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement calling on General Security of the Communist Party Xi to hold four members of Communist Chinas military accountable after the Justice Department charged them with the massive Equifax data breach in 2017.
"Senator Rick Scott said, China continues to steal our intellectual property and personal information."
"While General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi claims that his goal is to improve relations between our two countries, his actions send another message."
"If hes serious about working with the United States to improve our relationship, he should immediately extradite the military officials that were charged by the Justice Department for the Equifax breach in 2017."
"If General Security Xi and Communist China fail to do so, it will just be another sign that their promise of improved economic and political relations was more empty rhetoric from an adversary intent on competing with the United States on a global scale.Read more HERE."

"Sen. Rick Scott Introduces the Medical License Verification Act  Senators Rick Scott, John Cornyn, Chris Van Hollen and Catherine Cortez Masto introduced the Medical License Verification Act to prevent fraud in the healthcare system by requiring the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services (CMS) to verify that an applicants medical license is valid and in good standing prior to issuing them a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, which is required by healthcare providers to bill for insurance."
"Under current law, CMS issues NPI numbers without verification of the licensure information submitted, which allows non-physicians to obtain NPI numbers and opens up the possibility that they may fraudulently bill commercial health insurance."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Under our current system, loopholes exist that have allowed non-doctors to fraudulently bill health insurance companies to the tune of millions of dollars, which ultimately gets passed along to the consumer."
This is unfair and it has to stop.
The Medical License Verification Act is a small and commonsense step to address this weakness and prevent bad actors from defrauding families.Read more HERE.

"Im proud to share with you that USDA recently granted our request, awarding Elijay Telephone Company with a $4.4 million grant to deploy high-speed broadband infrastructure throughout Gilmer County."
"This strong investment will support the construction of 90 miles of fiber-optic infrastructure in a service area that includes 2,159 households and 22 poultry farms."
"Throughout my time in Congress, Ive worked not only to expand Georgians access to rural broadband, but to provide Georgians with more choices when it comes to service providers."
"Small internet service providers  like Ellijay Telephone Company  can help make that happen, which is why this grant funding falls right in line with the mission voiced by the Trump Administration to better connect rural America."

"Contrary to Democrats claims, H. J. Res."
79 isnt about protecting women  its about eliminating any law regulating abortion.
"If Democrats got their way and this bill was signed into law, the unlimited right to take an unborn childs life would forever be enshrined in the Constitution."
"I believe we, as a society, share a universal duty to protect the most defenseless humans among us  those living in the womb."

"                                               Dear Friends, This week, I introduced H.R."
"5863, the Student Loan Marriage Penalty Elimination Act."
This legislation addresses growing student loan debt by making the student loan interest tax deduction work better for married couples.
Current law penalizes married couples by only allowing them to take one deductioneven if both spouses qualify.
This bill would stop this unfair tax on student loans against married couples while also helping individuals with their student loan debt burden.
"For decades, hardworking Americans have been saddled with student loan debt which has delayed their dreams of achieving financial stability."
I am proud to lead this effort to maximize the student loan interest tax deduction that married couples can claim each tax year.
"This allows married couples to put more towards paying off their student loans, incur less interest, put more food on the table, or save a little more for a down payment on a home."
"This unfair marriage penalty came to my attention after Claudia McHale, a constituent from Garden City, discussed with me the situation of her niece and her husband."
"Both of them paid towards reducing their student loan yet were only able to claim a $2,500 deduction between the two of them, the same maximum amount a single individual can claim every tax year."
"As Claudia said, it is ridiculous that the federal government punishes taxpayers with student loan balances just because they get married."
"__________  On Tuesday, I received the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council."
"This recognition is awarded to Members of Congress with a proven record of defending the right to life, religious freedoms, and family values."
It is truly an honor to represent Missouri's 4th congressional district as we fight for our foundational values.
"Legislative Update On Thursday, Democrat leadership in the House attempted resurrect the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) through Congress."
"I commend the women who have gone before us, to celebrate the achievements women have made, and to reaffirm the fact that we are already equal in the eyes of God and in law."
"Women make up 51% of the population, comprise over half of college students, make up most of todays medical and law school students, and own the majority of new businesses."
"Little girls can be whatever they want to be whether that be an astronaut, a doctor, a full-time mom working at home, or a Member of Congress."
"In addition, federal law and court precedent uphold our rights."
That is something to applaud and I do.
"However, todays legislation is problematic on several fronts."
"First, the resolution is unconstitutional."
The time limit to pass the ERA expired decades ago.
Congress cant go back and remove a deadline from a previous constitutional amendment initiative.
"The Supreme Court has recognized that the 1972 ERA expired, and the Department of Justice issued a ruling saying, Congress may not revive a proposed amendment after a deadline for its ratification has expired."
Pretending we can remove the time limits for passage is both futile and deceptive.
"Secondly, if the time limit COULD be extended, the ERA would not bring women any more rights than they currently have but it would entrench the legality of abortion."
We know this from court precedent and by listening to those who have the most to gain from constitutionally protecting abortion on demand.
"In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that the Equal Rights Amendment in their state constitution requires state-funding of abortions."
Federal courts are likely to do the same.
Perhaps this is why every major pro-abortion organization is endorsing passage of the ERA.
"NARAL Pro-Choice America says: With its ratification, the ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion."
National Organization for Women: An ERAproperly interpretedcould negate the hundreds of laws that have been passed restricting access to abortion care.
But thats not the only concern with passing this resolution.
"Besides being unconstitutional and shredding state and federal pro-life protections, the ERA would also erase decades of progress which have provided opportunities for women, advanced womens progress through federal programs, and secured necessary protections for women and girls."
"By incorporating gender identity in the definition of sex, jeopardizing private spaces for women, girls sports programs, and womens educational institutions."
"By banning distinctions between men and women, the ERA also endangers laws, programs and funding designed to benefit women."
"The ERA provides a pathway for legal challenges to welfare programs, grants for battered womens shelters, efforts to bolster women participating in STEM programs."
These outcomes of the ERA are anything but pro-woman.
"I urge my colleagues to vote No on todays resolution and uphold the Constitution, promote life, and protect womens rights that have been so hard-fought gained."
District Update I am so pleased to tell you about an honor recently won by Columbia Public Schools.
"Project Tomorrow is a national education nonprofit dedicated to ensuring thattodays students are well prepared to be tomorrows innovators, leaders, and engaged citizens of the world."
"Project Tomorrow is recognizing Columbia Public Schools with its annual Speak Up District of Honor award, an honor given to school districts for leadership and commitment to listening to the voices and views of students, parents, and educators."
I believe it is through these valuable exchanges that better learning experiences are created for students from kindergarten through the 12th grade.
Congratulations to Columbia Public Schools for earning this distinction and for its dedication to improving and enhancing the educational experience for its students.
"Constituent Update I want to share with you that our office has joined forces with the Library of Congress to help preserve, forever, the stories of our veterans."
"The Veterans History Project began as an effort to collect the accounts of Americas World War II heroes, many of whom are passing away without their stories being saved for posterity."
It has since expanded to veterans of all military encounters with the goal of ensuring their personal memories are recorded and made available for future generations.

"Pathway to Peace This week, I introduced a package of seven bills that outline a bold progressive vision to reimagines the countrys approach to foreign policy as one that centers human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of Americas engagement in the world, and makes military action a last resort."
I have firsthand experience with how destructive war can beand I see how our continuous involvement in foreign conflicts is not making our country or our world any safer.
"I believe that when the United States says it champions human rights, democracy, and peace, we should mean it."
Eritrean Asylum ENSURE Act This administration will stop at nothing to make life painful for people of color seeking a better future.
"Not only has the President added Eritrea to its latest Muslim Ban, but he is also now threatening to deport Eritreans who have settled here."
Thats why I introduced the ENSURE Act to stop the United States from deporting Eritreans fleeing state oppression.
"The bill places a two-year stay on removals; prohibits the detention of Eritrean nationals during removal procedures; and, requires up-to-date reporting on Eritreans facing imminent removal."
"The PRO Act As a former union member myself, I can attest to the power that workers wield when they exercise their right to organize."
"Thats why we need the PRO Act, which puts power back in the hands of workers where it belongs."
"It will address the challenges and attacks that labor unions have been facing for decades that have led to the erosion of wages, a spike in workplace discrimination, and dangerous growth in inequality."
Unions dont only raise wages.
"They create working class solidarity between workers across gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."
"Trump Budget This week, the Budget Committee held a hearing on President Trumps latest spending proposals."
"The administration's new budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stampswhile continuing the Presidents disastrous tax breaks for the rich and while increasing wasteful spending on endless wars."
"We need a budget for the people that invests in housing, education, healthcare, and addressing the climate crisis, not a budget that benefits billionaires like the President."
"            February 14, 2020               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Passing Bill Increasing the Number of Agricultural Specialists for U.S. Customs and Border Protection  This week, I voted in favor of the Protecting Americas Food and Agriculture Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored."
"This bill authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to add 240 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agriculture Specialists, 20 agriculture canine teams, and additional support staff in the Office of Field Operations each fiscal year."
This is expected to continue until the number of specialists sustains the requirements put forward by the Agriculture Resource Allocation Model.
It is in the best interest of our national security to ensure that our food supply is sufficiently protected from any outside interference.
"In my many visits to our Northern Border, I have witnessed firsthand the need for more staffers who are specifically trained in this area."
I proudly voted in favor of this legislation to provide adequate resources and staffing at our borders and protect our countrys food and agriculture interests.
"Read more here,  Urging FDA Action on Dairy Labeling Rules  This week, I sent a letter to the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Steven Hahn, urging him to take action to enforce the FDA standards of identity that are already in place for dairy products."
"The FDA has formal rules surrounding the definition of labeling genuine dairy products and alternatives that they have chosen not to enforce for several years.I am also cosponsor of the Dairy PRIDE Act, a House bill that would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of any food that uses the market name of a dairy product but does not come from an animal, and does not contain milk as a primary ingredient."
"This letter to the FDA is the next step in urging them to act on dairy labeling issues.For far too long, the FDA has failed to combat the misuse of dairy terms on non-dairy products."
"Not only does this cause confusion among consumers, but it also puts our North Country dairy farmers at a disadvantage in the grocery store."
"Real dairy products come from real cows, and they should be the only products labeled as milk."
I will continue to be an outspoken advocate and urge FDA to enforce existing law.
"Dropping the Puck in Glens Falls to Stick It to Cancer and Helping Kids Learn to Skate   This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the community ""Try Hockey for Free"" event in Glens Falls, where I helped introduce many young constituentsto the sport of hockey."
This great event was hosted by the New York Rangers hockey team.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the puck drop at the Adirondack Thunder game.
"NY-21 is hockey country, and it is amazing to see our youth carry on the tradition!"
"Meeting with Constituents and Groups Important to the North Country    I met with the Agriculture Retailers Association to discuss their priorities, including agriculture labor reform, infrastructure, rural broadband, and the importance of training the next generation of our workforce."
It was great to meet with constituents and representatives from the Center for Lyme Action to discuss the important work they are doing.
"In Congress, I work diligently to promote prevention and treatment for Lyme disease."
"I am a cosponsor of the TICK Act, legislation to establish an office of oversight and coordination for tick-borne diseases."
I will continue to support increased funding for research into this disease that affects many of my constituents and many people throughout the country.
"I also met with General Joseph M. Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army."
"We discussed many issues facing Fort Drum, including improvements to childcare facilities and childcare facility worker hiring standards."
I look forward to prioritizing the Army's requests for the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act.
I am proud to be the number one advocate for Fort Drum in Congress.
"Cosponsoring the Forest Recovery Act  This week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Forest Recovery Act, legislation that will support timber farmers who have been affected by catastrophic loss events."
The bill will help forest landowners recover from natural disasters by eliminating the basis limitation rule and allowing them to deduct up to the fair market value of their devastated trees.
This levels the playing field for timber farmers who have been impacted by events like extreme weather and forest fires.
"Farmers across many sectors continue to be impacted by extreme weather events, and not all of them are protected by crop insurance."
"This bipartisan bill will help timber producers continue their business, which will have a positive impact on many of our North Country communities who include timber production as part of their economic base."
"Cosponsoring Bill to Ensure All Active Duty Overseas Military Ballots Are Counted  I also became a cosponsor of the Counting All Military Votes Act, legislation to make Express Mail Labels available to deployed active duty military serving onour embassies, consulates, and/or in diplomatic posts."
This will ensure each of their absentee votes will be successfully delivered on time by Express Mail in order to be counted.
"As the Representative of the 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army, our district understands that their participation in the electoral process is critical."
Our brave men and women serving in active duty overseas assignments deserve a say in our government and elected leaders.
"Each of their votes must be counted, and this legislation ensures expedited mailing for their absentee ballots."
We are forever indebted to those who sacrifice daily while fighting for our freedom and Im honored to advocate for our great servicemembers in Congress.
Announcing Housing Development Funding for Glens Falls and Watertown  I was thrilled to announce United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for Glens Falls and Watertown.
"The Community Planning and Development Program Formula Allocations provide grants to states and local units of government to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, specifically for low- and moderate-income communities."
"Glens Falls will receive $490,696 in funding and the City of Watertown will receive $920,779 in Community Development Block (CDBG) Grants, which will be used to support housing initiatives in both towns."
"Affordable housing is a prominent issue in many areas in my district, and initiatives like this help communities to provide more affordable and suitable opportunities."
I will continue to advocate for programs that enable our local communities to support those in need of assistance.
"Writing an Op-Ed Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Miracle on Ice  This week, I wrote an op-ed commemorating the 40th anniversary of the iconic Miracle on Ice and celebrating the North Countrys rich Olympic history."
The op-ed was published inThe Sunthis week.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:    ___________________  Featured Read:  Times Union:State, federal lawmakers clash over access to DMV records  U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a staunch opponent of the Green Light Law, criticized Democrats for ""absolutely [leaving] out federal agencies"" as they decided to bar immigration officials from accessing DMV databases."
"Stefanik, whose district abuts the Canadian border, argued that federal officials must access DMV records to check license plates and stop possible criminals from crossing international lines  though she did not draw a connection explicitly between a lack of access to DMV databases and applications for travel perks."
"""New York state should repeal the Green Light Law,"" Stefanik, who is an enrollee in the Global Entry program, said in an interview Monday afternoon."
"""They should stop prioritizing illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens."""

" News from Representative Courtney                                              Dear Cormack,  Following a busy week in Washington, here with a few updates on several priorities for eastern Connecticut."
Honoring Those Lost on 10thAnniversary of Kleen Energy Explosion  Last Friday marked ten years since the tragic explosion at the Kleen Energy Systems power plant in Middletown.
"The blast injured dozens of workers, and it took the lives of six: PeterChepulis, RaymondDobratz, Kenneth Haskell, RoyRushton, Chris Walters, and one of my close friends, Ron Crabb."
"On Sunday, I was in Middletown along with colleagues, community leaders, and friends and family of those who were lost in the tragic accident, to honor and remember those who never came home that day."
"Ten years ago, workplace safety laws failed these six individuals, and the dozens of others who were injured in the blast."
"Nothing can ever make up for the lives lost that day, but we have a responsibility as a community and as a Congress to ensure we do all we can to protect Americas workers."
"Last year, on the 9thanniversary of the explosion, I introduced the Protecting Americas Workers Act (PAWA) to strengthen and modernize the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA)  which hasnt been meaningfully updated by Congress in over 50 years."
"The bill is simple, and contains some common-sense measures like improving whistleblower protections; requiring the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to investigate all cases of death and series injuries that occur within a place of employment; and establishing rights for families of workers who were killed on the job by giving them the right to meet with OSHA investigators, receive copies of citations, and more."
The lives lost ten years ago deserve to be honored with action.
"To read how PAWA makes workplaces safer, click here to visit my website."
"Rep. Courtney joined community leaders, friends, and families at a memorial service for those lost in the Kleen Energy explosion     Bipartisan Action on Surprise Health Care Billing  Surprise medical bills are a crisis waiting to happen for so many families in eastern Connecticut and across the country."
"When people are ill, the last thing they should have to worry about is how to safeguard themselves against complex billing technicalities that result in surprise, sky-high medical bills."
"The cost of health care is a top-line issue for folks in our region, and surprise billing is a major contributor  my office has received far too many calls from people in eastern Connecticut who have not been treated fairly."
"Weve already taken steps in the House to curb the cost of prescription medication, and this week we took on surprise billing."
"On Tuesday, my colleagues and I on the house Education  Labor Committee voted to approve the bipartisan Ban Surprise Billing Act (H.R."
"5800), a bill that would protect patients from devastating surprise medical bills, and would finally give them the financial confidence and peace of mind they deserve."
"These protections would be for everyone  for people who receive health care through their employer, and for those who are enrolled in the individual market."
"Erica Moser did a great job covering the ins and outs of the bill in her article for The Day, click here to read more."
One of the most exciting parts about H.R.
"5800 is that its so bipartisan  it was supported by both the Democratic Chairman of the Committee, and by the Republican Ranking Member."
"People in Congressional Districts across America are impacted by surprise medical bills, and its great to see Members from both sides of the aisle coming together to address the problem."
"I commend Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for working together to advance this bipartisan bill, I was proud to support it, and Im looking forward to voting to pass it when it comes before the House for a final vote."
Click here to watch Rep. Courtney's remarks in favor of H.R.
"5800     Meeting with National Defense University Students  On Tuesday, I hosted a large group of students from the National Defense Universitys Eisenhower School to discuss some of the top priorities on the horizon for our Armed Forces and the industrial base, and to learn more about their work as students focusing on undersea warfare."
"As always, these NDU students were totally impressive  they came to study in Washington from all across the U.S., represented a variety of branches, backgrounds, agencies, and experiences, and were sharp and well informed on our national security strategy and priorities."
Our conversation turned in large part to the flurry of activity weve seen in Connecticuts defense manufacturing sector recently.
"Up and down the supply chain, skilled manufacturers and small companiesare seeing new opportunities for work."
"Connecticuts defense manufacturing is booming, but even that good news presents its own challenges  mainly, how can we make sure that we have a workforce thats skilled and well educated enough to take advantage of these new opportunities?"
"The answer to that question has been the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Boards revolutionary job skills training program, the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative (MPI)."
"The MPI was kick-started with a $6 million federal grant that I helped to procure back in 2015, and since then its flourished alongside our states burgeoning manufacturing sector."
The MPI has helped Electric Boat (EB) to grow by thousands of employees in just a few short years.
"In the last year alone, EB reported that they made over 1,000 hires directly from the pipeline."
"The MPI is exactly what was needed to fill the ranks of a booming manufacturing sector, and its been a total success for our region."
"It was great to host this impressive class of National Defense University students in Washington this week, and to discuss with them all of the moving parts that must work in unison to deliver the tools are Navy and Armed Forces need."
"Students from the National Defense University met with Rep. Courtney at his Washington, DC office      The Start of a Months-Long Budget Process  Earlier this week, the White House released their official 2021 budget request."
"Ultimately it is Congresss job to craft and pass a budget through the House and the Senate, and its the President's job to sign it."
"However, the start of the budget negotiation process typically begins with the White Houses budget request  their proposed budget  and this year were off to a strange start."
"The White Houses proposed budget makes $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other health care programs over the next 10 years."
"It also slashes investments that help workers find and keep good paying jobs, and altogether eliminates bedrock programs that help fund Americas public education system."
"Thankfully, this is just the start of a months-long budget negotiation process."
"The proposed budget introduced by the White House yesterday has already received criticism from both sides of the aisle, and its not going to make it through Congress as-is."
"Its not encouraging to see the White House kick the process off with a budget proposal that points so many important programs in the wrong direction, but as the House moves into our own budget negotiating process, we have an opportunity to work together across the aisle to get it right."
"It will remain our top priority in the House to protect and defend the health, financial security, and well-being of millions of Americans as we begin debate on the 2021budget."
Proposed Shipbuilding Budget Receives Bipartisan Criticism One of the components of the 2021 budget request that has generated significant bipartisan concern is the plan to cut back on shipbuilding investment for our Navy.
"Congress had traditionally worked together to provide strong support for the Navys plans to build, modernize and support a strong fleet of ships, submarines, destroyers and other vessels critical to our national defense."
"Contrary to expectations, however, the budget we received this week took a significant step backwards  proposing to purchase just 7 ships, a sharp reduction from the 10 that the TrumpAdministration itselfplanned for this year and a nearly 20% reduction in the budget for shipbuilding."
"Incredibly, one of the cuts included the reduction of a Virginia-class submarine, with only one requested in 2021."
This plan flies in the face of more than a decade of testimony from our defense leaders about the unmatched value of our submarine force and increasing alarm about shortfalls in the fleet.
Its even in direct contradiction with the Trump Administration's own plans for our Navy and defense strategy.
"Given that every submarine we build will be in service for four decades, the decision to plan for only one new submarine next year is short-sighted."
"As Chairman of the HouseSeapowerand Projection Forces Subcommittee, I can say with certainly that this budget is dead on arrival."
"Throughout the week, bipartisan concern about this proposal has grown across Congress and I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to dig into this surprising plan as we begin our work on the 2021 budget."
"Click here to read about some of my efforts, and the bipartisan reaction to the budget."
Click here to read Rep. Courtney's bipartisan letter to Secretary Esper     Thank you for taking a moment to read my weeklyeNewsletter.
"Its an honor every day to represent eastern Connecticut, and Im grateful that youve made my weekly update a part of your weekly routine."
"                                              Dear Lindsey,  This week, Senator Baldwin joined 32 of her Senate colleagues, led by Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), in introducing legislation that would put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050."
"The Clean Economy Act heeds the call for bold climate action, and at the same time boosts American competitiveness, promotes healthier frontline communities and fosters a growing economy that works for everyone."
The Clean Economy Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use existing authorities to put our country on a pathway to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050.
"Let there be no doubt, climate change is a real, immediate and growing threat to national security, public health and our economy."
"The longer we fail to act, the more costly climate change will be, said Senator Baldwin."
The Clean Economy Act will help confront the climate crisis by aiming to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
"Im proud to support this effort because taking bold action on climate change is not just an environmental goal for Wisconsin, it is an urgent economic necessity."
The worlds leading scientists have warned that humanity must limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
"According to the United Nations annual Emissions Gap Report released last month, collective global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not yet substantial enough to reach that temperature goal."
"By providing clear direction from Congress, the Clean Economy Act mandates EPA and other federal agencies to use authorities and tools already available to them to rapidly achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while fostering a stronger, fairer economy for all Americans."
"Any plan developed by the EPA must achieve rapid reductions at minimal costs, prioritize public health, and support a strong labor workforce."
"EPA is also required to build upon existing state, local and private climate programs and set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2025, 2030 and 2040."
"Other federal agencies would be required to do their part to help the nation meet the net-zero goal and help enhance Americas global competitiveness through investments in research and development, innovation and equitable access to worker training."
"This net-zero legislation is supported collectively by major environmental groups, business groups and organized labor."

"Roy Blunt, US Senator for Missouri Dear Friend, After weeks of Democrats' politically-driven impeachment [link 1] efforts tying up the Senate, I'm glad we can finally get back to the work on the issues Missourians care about."
Here are some of the priorities and policies I've been working on in 2020: *Expanding Access to Rural Broadband* More than 1/3 of rural Missourians do not currently have access to a modern broadband connection.
Broadband is as important as the telephone was 70 years ago.
"Every rural Missourian, whether they're students, farmers, small business owners or health care professionals, will benefit from high speed internet."
"That's why I've supported government funding programs that target areas without access to broadband and worked with local, state, and federal officials to end the digital divide."
"Recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Missouri will receive $60.9 million [link 2] to expand rural broadband through a new USDA program."
That program has brought a total of $100 million to Missouri providers.
"In 2018, Missouri was awarded the largest amount of any state through the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase II auction: a total of $255 million over the next 10 years."
I'm continuing to work with the administration to make sure we get federal support to the areas that need it most.
"*Fighting Flawed Liver Transplant Policy* Last week, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) moved forward with misguided changes to the national liver allocation policy."
"Under these changes, Missouri could see up to a 32% decrease in the number of liver transplants in our state."
"Nationwide, as much as 40% of the country could see increased costs and longer wait times."
This deeply-flawed policy [link 3] rewards historically low-performing organ procurement organizations and doesn't take steps to improve their performance and help more people receive a liver.
I have repeatedly urged [link 4] the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review OPTN's policy-making process and HHS' oversight of the program.
I will keep fighting for a fair system that protects Missouri patients eagerly awaiting a life-saving liver transplant.
"*Connecting Veterans with Employers* I introduced, and the president signed into law, the HIRE Vets Act to help connect more veterans with employers [link 5] who recognize the value they bring to the workforce."
"The HIRE Vets Medallion Award Program created a tiered recognition program to recognize employers that make veterans hiring, retention, and career development a priority."
"If you are a business owner, you can apply here [link 6]."
"I'm very proud that Missouri business owners have embraced this program and made it a priority to not only hire veterans, but to provide workforce development opportunities for them to grow in their careers after the military."
"Last year, seven Missouri employers participated in the program."
I look forward to seeing more Missouri employers recognized this year.
"*Creating Opportunities for America's Farmers, Ranchers, and Businesses* While the news focused on impeachment around-the-clock, the Senate passed, and President Trump signed, the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement [link 7]."
"USMCA will level the playing field for American farmers and business owners, allowing them better access to our two neighboring markets."
This modern trade agreement will also strengthen our digital trade and expand market access.
"Because of our agriculture-driven economy, Missouri is one of the states that benefits the most from trade deals that create fair standards for our farmers and ranchers."
Our economy is stronger than it's been in 50 years thanks in large part to having the right tax policy and right regulatory policy in place.
"With USMCA and the other trade agreements President Trump has secured, we've also got the right trade policy."
"To stay up-to-date on my work for Missourians, be sure to follow me on Twitter [link 8], Facebook [link 9], and Instagram [link 10]."
"  News fromCongressman Steve Cohen                            Website  Serving You  Legislative Work  Our District  Resources               February 12, 2020      Dear Friend,  As your representative in Congress, part of my job is making sure your concerns and issues with federal agencies are dealt with fairly and efficiently, and my office is here to help you navigate what can be a complex and confusing process."
"If you have any questions or concerns about your dealings with any federal agency or your federal benefits, my staff will hold Congress on your Corner from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Gaisman Community Center on Friday, February 28."
"My staff will be on hand to help with:  Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and military service issues, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and services, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) home loans, federal grant applications, railroad retirement benefits, visas and passports, Internal Revenue Service problems, and more."
"I hope you can make it on Friday, February 28."
"Regardless, please do not hesitate to call my office at 901-544-4131 with any questions or concerns."
"Senator for Oregon  Dear *First Name*, For a president who makes himself out to be a champion of typical working Americans, Donald Trump has run the same old Republican playbook of giving tax handouts to the wealthy and slashing the safety net that supports everybody else."
"He started this con with his 2016 campaign promises not to touch Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and now he wants to cut them by more than $1.5 trillion.?"
"Bottom line, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will be on the chopping block as long as Donald Trump is president."
"Trump?s not only trying to slash safety net programs critical to Oregonians, he?s once again threatening to sell off Bonneville Power and raise monthly utility bills for Oregon families and businesses."
Too many families in Oregon are already balancing the food bill against the utility bill and do not need the administration to come in like a wrecking ball and make things worse.
This misguided scheme would be felt by everybody in the Northwest.
Oregonians see through this Trump double-talk.
Trump?s thoughts are not with the good of the country.
"They?re for the wealthy and, as always, himself.?"
"As part of my commitment to hear directly from Oregonians, I?m hosting four town halls in the coming days ."
"I encourage you to come and make your voice heard if you think Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security should be on Trump?s chopping block.????????"
"Sincerely,    Please do not reply to this e-mail."
                Home Constituent Services About Me Newsroom        Dear Oklahoma friends and neighbors:  The country is deeply divided on multiple issues right now.
The impeachment trial is both a symptom of our times and another example of our division.
"At the beginning of our nation, we did not have an impeachment inquiry of a president for almost 100 years with the partisan impeachment of Andrew Johnson."
"After more than 100 years, another impeachment inquiry was conducted when the House began a formal impeachment inquiry into President Nixon in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410-4."
"Within a period of weeks, President Nixon resigned before he was formally impeached."
"Then, just over two decades later, President Clinton was impeached by the House, on another mostly partisan vote leading to a partisan acquittal in the Senate."
This season of our history and has been referred to as the Age of Investigations and the Age of Impeachment.
We have had multiple special counsels since 1974 over multiple topics.
This is more than just oversight; it has been a unique time in American history when the politics of the moment have driven rapid calls for investigation and impeachment.
"Over the past three years, the House of Representatives has voted four times to open an impeachment inquiry: once in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019."
Only the second vote in 2019 actually passed and began a formal inquiry.
The Mueller investigation that consumed most of 2018 and 2019 answered many questions about Russian attacks on our voting systemsthough no votes were changedbut it was also a $32 million investigation that took more than two years of Americas attention.
For the last four months the country has been consumed with impeachment hearings and investigations.
"The first rumors of issues with Ukraine arose August 28 when Politico published a story about US foreign aid being slow-walked for Ukraine, and then on September 18 when TheWashington Post published a story about a whistleblower report that claimed President Trump pressured an unnamed foreign head of state to do an investigation for his campaign."
"Within days ofTheWashington Post story on September 24, Speaker Pelosi announced that the House would begin hearings to impeach the President, which led to the formal House vote to open the impeachment inquiry on October 31 and then a vote to impeach the President on December 18th."
"But after the partisan vote to impeach the President, Speaker Pelosi held the articles of impeachment for a month before turning them over to the Senate, which began the formal trial of the President of the United States on January 16, 2020."
"After hearing hours of arguments from both House Managers and the Presidents legal defense team and Senators asking 180 questions to both sides, the trial concluded February 5, 2020."
"Key Dates to Know   April 21, 2019 - President Zelensky is elected President of Ukraine."
May 21 - President Zelensky sworn in.
"After the ceremony, President Zelensky abolishes Parliament and calls for quick (snap) elections on July 21."

August 26 - The Inspector General for the Intelligence Community declares the whistleblower report an urgent matter and asks for its release within seven days.
"The Justice Department looks over the report and notes that though it was written by a person in the intelligence community, it is not related to intelligence matters, so it does not fall within the Inspector Generals jurisdiction and it is forwarded on to the Department of Justice for review."
August 28 - Politico publishes a story that the annual military aid for Ukraine is currently being slow-walked.
September 9 - The Inspector General contacts the House Intelligence Committee to let them know that he has not been able to release the whistleblower report to their committee.

"Important Context of What Was Happening in Ukraine  Ukraine became independent in 1991 when it broke away from the Soviet Union, but the Ukrainians have faced constant pressure from Russia ever since."
"In 2014 Ukraine forced out its pro-Russia president, and Moscow retaliated by taking over Crimea (and stealing the Ukrainian Navy), then rolling tanks into eastern Ukraine and taking all of eastern Ukraine by force."
Russian and Ukrainian troops continue to fight every day in eastern Ukraine.
The people of Ukraine face an aggressive Russia on the east and pervasive Soviet era corruption throughout the government and the business community.
President Trump met the previous President of Ukraine in 2017 to talk about other countries helping Ukraine with greater military support funds and to ask how Ukraine could address corruption on a wider scale.
"The two Presidents also spoke about lethal aid (allowing the Ukrainians to buy sniper rifles, anti-tank javelin missiles, and other lethal supplies) to help them fight the invading Russians."
The US also started sending a couple hundred American troops to train Ukrainian soldiers in the far west of Ukraine.
"UkrainianPresident Zelensky  On April 21, 2019, President Zelensky was overwhelmingly elected as the new President of Ukraine."
"He was a sitcom actor/comedian who had no political experience, but was well known for his television show in which he played the part of a corruption-fighting teacher who was elected as President of Ukraine."
"His television popularity helped him win the election, but when he was sworn in on May 21, he was relatively unknown to most of the world."
"On the same day as his inauguration, May 21, President Zelensky abolished Parliament and called for snap elections to put his party in power."
"With a new president in place and parliamentary elections in Ukraine coming, starting in June of 2019, the President ordered foreign aid to Ukraine to be held until the end of the fiscal year, but agencies were informed that they should do all the preliminary work needed before the aid was sent, so it would be ready to release at a moments notice."
The leadership in Ukraine was not notified that there was a hold on their foreign aid.
"The new Parliament was elected on July 21, and President Zelenskys party won by a landslide."
"By mid-August, the new Parliament was working on anti-corruption efforts and trying to establish a High Court on Corruption, which they put in place September 5, 2019."
"There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the early days of the new administration, but by mid August there was clear evidence of actual change in a country that desperately needed a new direction from its corrupt past."
"President Trumps Phone Call to President Zelensky  On July 25, when President Trump called President Zelensky, the President congratulated President Zelensky for the big win in Parliament and talked about burden-sharing (other nations also paying their share of support for Ukraine)."
The two presidents talked about their disapproval of the previous ambassadors to each others countries.
"But instead of following all the staff preparation notes written by Lt. Col Vindman, the National Security Council staffer assigned to Ukraine, and just talking about corruption in general, the President brought up a question about Ukraine and the 2016 election interference, which I will note below."
"President Zelensky also brought up to President Trump that his staff was planning to meet with Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, in the coming days, which led to a conversation about Joe Biden and the firing of the previous prosecutor in Ukraine."
"After the call, Lt. Col Vindman contacted an attorney at the National Security Council to express his policy concerns about the call."
"It is interesting to note that Lt. Col. Vindmans boss, Tim Morrison, was also on the call, but he did not see any problems or concerns with the call according to his own testimony in the House impeachment inquiry."
"Within a month a whistleblower filed a report about the call, saying he heard about the call second-hand and was concerned about the implications of a conversation about elections on a head-of-state call."
"To keep the July 25th call in context with other news, the day before it took placeJuly 24Robert Mueller had testified before Congress as the last official act to close down the two-and-a-half-year Mueller investigation and clear the President and his campaign team of any further accusation of election interference."
"During the impeachment trial in the Senate, the House Managers repeated over and over that the President was planning to cheat again on the next election, but the final conclusion of the Mueller Report was ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the (Trump) Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities."
"This is especially notable, because for years a rumor circulated that Ukraine was part of the 2016 election interference and that someone in Ukraine was hiding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server that was hacked by the Russians in 2016."
"As the conspiracy theory goes, it was actually the Ukrainians that hacked the DNC, not the Russians."
This is the Crowdstrike theory that President Trump asked President Zelensky to help solve during the call.
Agencies of the US Intelligence Community have stated over and over that they did not believe that Ukraine was involved in the Russian election interference from 2016.
I personally agree with the Intelligence Community assessment.
"But Rudy Giuliani, and multiple others around President Trump believed there was a secret plan in 2016 to hurt President Trumps election from Ukraine."
"This accusation was amplified by bits of truth, including that the Ukrainian Ambassador to the US wrote an editorial in support of Hillary Clinton in 2016 right before the election, and several other Ukrainian officials publicly spoke out against candidate Trump in 2016."
"There is nothing illegal about a foreign nation speaking out for or against a presidential candidate, whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in 2016, or anyone else in the future."
"It may not be wise to take sides before an election, but it is not illegal."
"Just because some Ukrainian officials took sides, does not mean that the whole Ukrainian government worked on a cyberattack on our elections."
"But since this rumor had persisted, and it was a new administration now in Ukraine, President Trump asked President Zelensky to help clear up the facts if he could."
"That is certainly not illegal or improper, and it is certainly not something that could help the President in the 2020 election, especially since the 2016 Russian election accusation had just been closed the day before."
"The 2016 Crowdstrike theory is the issue that President Trump asked President Zelensky to do us a favor about, not the Bidens or Burisma."
"During the July 25 call after the question about Crowdstrike, President Zelensky mentioned to President Trump that one of his advisers would be meeting with Rudy Giuliani soon."
"Then, President Trump affirmed that meeting and encouraged them to talk about the Biden investigation and the firing of the Ukrainian Prosecutor."
"That may seem out of the blue, but in Washington, DC, that week, the city was buzzing about a Washington Post article that had been written three days before (July 22, 2019) detailing Hunter Bidens giant salary ($83,000 per month) for doing essentially nothing for a corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company and how it undercut Vice President Bidens message on corruption."
It is important to get the context of that week to understand the context of the phone call that day.
"I have no doubt that the story was just as big of news in Kiev, Ukraine as it was in Washington, DC, that week."
"President Trumps personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had been in and out of Ukraine since November 2018, meeting with government officials and trying to find out more about the Crowdstrike theory or any other Ukrainian connection to the 2016 election."
During that time Rudy Giuliani met several former prosecutors from Ukraine who blamed their departure on Vice President Biden.
It is clear that Rudy Giuliani was working to gain information about both of these issues in his capacity as President Trumps private attorney.
"It is not criminal for Rudy Giuliani to work on opposition research for a presidential campaign or to work on behalf of his client to clear his name from any issues related to the 2016 campaign, which he had done since November 2018."
"Some have stated that since this was foreign information, it is illegal."
That is absolutely not true.
"In fact, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee in 2016 paid a British citizen, Christopher Steele, to work his contacts in Russia to create the now debunked Steele Dossier which the FBI used to open its investigation into President Trump, leading directly to the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller."
"That Dossier was opposition research done in Russia by a British citizen, paid for by the Clinton campaign team."
"Their opposition research was not illegal, but the use and abuse of that document by the FBI to start an investigation was certainly inappropriate and is most likely illegal."
"But, the FBI warrant issue is still being investigated by the ongoing Durham probe."
"During the July 25 call, when President Zelensky brought up the issue of Rudy Giuliani and President Trump replied to his statement."
"You can argue that President Trump should not have discussed the issue with President Zelensky when he brought it up, but it is certainly not illegal or impeachable to talk about it, especially when there are serious questions about Hunter Bidens work with Burisma."
That is not a conservative conspiracy theory; the issue of Hunter Bidens employment in Ukraine was a problem for years at the State Department.
It had been raised to Vice President Biden when he was still in office.
"Every State Department official interviewed for the Trump impeachment investigation noted that at best it was a clear conflict of interest and it was the center of a huge story on corruption in the Washington Post on July 22, 2019."
It had the appearance of high-level corruption by using a well-placed family member on the board of a known corrupt gas company in Ukraine to shelter it from prosecutors.
"Hunter Biden had only resigned from the Burisma board a few months before the July 25 phone call, just prior to when his dad announced his run for the Presidency in 2019."
"After the July 25 phone call, Attorney General Barr did not have any follow up meetings or calls with Ukrainian officials."
"Rudy Giuliani did have additional conversations with Ukrainian officials, which are legal to do since he is a private attorney representing the President."
"Text of July 25, 2019 Phone Call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky:  The President: Congratulations on a great victory."
We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job.
"The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily."
It's a fantastic achievement.
President Zelensky: You are absolutely right Mr. President.
We did win big and we worked hard for this.
We worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you.
We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections.
We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success.
"I'm able to tell you the following; the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election."
I think I should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often.
The President: (laughter) That's a very good idea.
I think your country is very happy about that.
"President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country."
We brought in many many new people.
"Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government."
You are a great teacher for us and in that.
The President: Well it is very nice of you to say that.
I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine.
We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.
Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.
Germany does almost nothing for you.
All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about.
"When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything."
A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.
I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.
President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely right.
"Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions."
They are not enforcing the sanctions.
They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.
"It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine."
Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation.
I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense.
We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost.
ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.
The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.
"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike."
I guess you have one of your wealthy people...
"The server, they say Ukraine has it."
"There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation."
I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people.
I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.
"As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine."
"Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible."
President Zelensky: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier.
"For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation."
We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine.
"For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer."
I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so.
I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.
I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us.
I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people.
I also wanted to tell you that we are friends.
We are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership.
"I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.. That I can assure you."
The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair.
"A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."
Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man.
"He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you."
I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General.
Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy.
If you could speak to him that would be great.
"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that."
"The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great."
Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...
It sounds horrible to me.
President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor.
"First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation."
"Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September."
"He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue."
The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.
"On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich."
It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%.
Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side.
She would not accept me as a new President well enough.
"The President: Well, she's going to go through some things."
I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.
I'm sure you will figure it out.
I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything.
Your economy is going to get better and better I predict.
You have a lot of assets.
It's a great country.
"I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people."
President Zelensky: I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States.
"Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower."
I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future.
"I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC."
"On the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation."
"As to the economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for Ukraine is energy independence."
I believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with United States.
We are already working on cooperation.
We are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future meeting.
We will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better.
I would like to thank you very much for your support.
"Well, thank you very much and I appreciate that."
I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.
"Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call."
Give us a date and we'll work that out.
I look forward to seeing you.
President Zelensky: Thank you very much.
I would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better.
I am looking forward to our meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city.
We have a beautiful country which would welcome you.
"On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully."
"After that, it might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine."
"We can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better than mine."
"The President: Okay, we can work that out."
I look forward to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I think we are going to be there at that time.
President Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. President.
The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've done.
The whole world was watching.
I'm not sure it was so much of an upset but congratulations.
President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.
"Based on a whistleblower report about the July 25 call, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the report on September 13 and started its impeachment inquiry on September 24."
"Senate Trial  House Managers Case for Impeachment  In the Senate impeachment trial, House Managers stated their belief that the President had carried out a scheme to cheat in the 2020 election by withholding financial aid to Ukraine and withholding a White House meeting with the new President of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine announcing it would investigate Joe Biden, Burisma, and 2016 election interference."
Let's discuss the facts of both.
"White House Meeting  There is no question that President Trump had offered a White House meeting to President Zelensky three times: once in May on a phone call after President Zelensky won his election, once in June in a letter, and finally in the July 25th call after President Zelenskys party won the parliamentary elections."
But Tim Morrison (a State Department official called as a witness by the House) also testified that they were working on heads-of-state meetings with twelve other heads of state during that same time period.
Many nations were trying to line up meetings in the White House during the summer of 2019.
"During the July 25 call, President Zelensky offered to instead move their meeting from a White House meeting to a face-to-face meeting in Warsaw, Poland, when they would both be there on September 1, 2019."
"The Presidents agreed, and planning began on the meeting in August."
"By August 22, the meeting planning was in full swing as noted by emails in the House hearings evidence."
"However, Hurricane Dorian slammed into the US in the hours leading up to the September 1 meeting, causing a last-minute shift to the Vice President traveling to Poland so the President could stay in the US to monitor hurricane relief."
"We know that Vice President Pence met face-to-face with President Zelensky, and they spoke about other nations paying their fair share to help Ukraine and the issue of corruption across Ukraine."
"We know from the preparation materials and the meeting notes themselves that during the meeting the Vice President did not bring up or discuss the issue of Burisma, Joe Biden, or any other campaign conversation with President Zelensky."
The White House found the next available time when President Trump and President Zelensky would both be in the same place at the same time to set up a face-to-face meeting: September 25 at the UN Assembly in New York.
"That meeting was set up, and it took place as scheduled."
"In the Senate impeachment trial, the House managers maintained that only a White House meeting was sufficient and that it was being withheld, but the facts show that President Zelensky himself floated the idea of a meeting in Poland and that the meeting was not barred or withheld."
"In the early months of President Zelenskys term, there was a great deal of concern about him, his staff, and his plans because he was an unknown political figure."
"Until more was known about him, it was entirely appropriate to show caution in coordinating a meeting, but once his nationwide anti-corruption efforts began in August, it was clear that face-to-face meetings were planned and carried out."
There was no withholding of a face-to-face meeting with President Trump and President Zelensky.
There cannot be a quid pro quo if the meeting was not withheld from Ukrainian officials.
Foreign Aid to Ukraine  The House Managers claimed that there was a secret plot to extort or bribe the leadership of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden in exchange for around $400 million of US aid.
"The aid was State Department and foreign military aid that had been provided for the past four years, since Ukraine had been in a war with Russia."
"After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its occupation of Crimea and the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, the US started sending aid to help the Ukrainian government."
"Congress allowed lethal and non-lethal aid to support Ukraine, but during the previous administration, only non-lethal aid was sent."
"Under President Trumps administration, it was determined that the United States would give the leadership of Ukraine lethal aid to help them fight off Russian tanks, which was President Zelenskys reference to javelins in the July 25th phone call and his gratitude to President Trump for allowing those tank killing rockets to flow to Ukraine."
"To be clear, the theory of funds being withheld from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation does not originate from the July 25 call read out."
There is nothing in the text of the call that threatens the withholding of funds in exchange for an investigation.
"The theory originates from the fact that aid was held back by the Office of Management and Budget, headed by the Presidents Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and the presumption of US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that the aid must have been held because of the Presidents desire to get the Biden investigation done, since the Presidents attorney, Rudy Giuliani was working to find out more about the Biden investigation."
"Ambassador Sondland told multiple people about his theory, but when he finally called President Trump and asked him directly about it, the President responded that he did not have any quid pro quo, he just wanted the President of Ukraine to do what he ran on and do the right thing."
"Obviously, people who assume the worst about President Trump take this as a secret message that there actually was a quid pro quo, but the most important fact is that Ambassador Sondland did not read it that way after his call with the President."
Ambassador Sondland believed that the President was serious.
"Unfortunately, the White House Counsel was never allowed to cross examine Ambassador Sondland during the House investigation to get the facts about who he talked to and why he came to believe for a while that there was an effort to push for investigations in exchange for money."
"During the Senate trial, I listened closely to the facts surrounding the withholding of aid money to Ukraine."
This was by far the most serious charge against the President.
"Two key questions had to be answered for me: why was the aid held, and why was the aid released."
There was no question the aid was held for a couple of months.
The question was why?
Statements from the House witnesses during the House impeachment inquiry answered the two key questions: the aid was held because there was a legitimate concern about the new President of Ukraine and his administration in the early days of his presidency and the aid was released on time when the new Ukrainian Parliament starting passing anti-corruption laws in August and after Vice President Pence sat down face to face with President Zelensky on September 1 in Poland to discuss their progress on corruption.
We should not lose track of what was happening in Ukraine in 2019.
A new President was elected who was a TV actor with no political experience and no record on how he would handle Russia or the issue of widespread national corruption in Ukraine.
"He ran on a platform of anti-corruption at all levels, but no one knew how he would govern."
"His campaign was funded by a Ukrainian oligarch who owned a major media outlet, and one of his first advisers was the former attorney for that oligarch."
I personally spoke to many of the State Department officials in Ukraine in May of 2019 and heard their concerns about the new government.
"Then, newly elected President Zelensky used his power to dissolve their Parliament the day he was sworn in and called for snap elections in which the vast majority of the newly elected leaders were from his newly formed party."
"To our State Department and the White House, this was either a really a good sign or a really bad sign."
"Either Ukraine was about to take a major change for the better with new leadership, or this new young leader was about to assume real centralized power."
"No one knew for certain in May, June, and July of 2019."
"Within a few weeks in August, the new Parliament got to work passing anti-corruption laws and making significant changes in their accountability and for the country."
This was a very good sign.
"When Vice President Pence met face to face with President Zelensky September 1, both sides had confidence the country was taking a new direction."
"On September 10 Vice President Pence and Senator Rob Portman met with President Trump to tell him about the progress that had been made, and both advised lifting the hold on aid."
"The aid was lifted the next day, September 11."
"No investigation into Hunter Biden or Burisma was ever done by Ukraine, and no part of the US Department of Justice was ever involved in any investigation of Hunter Biden or Burisma."
"Though the aid was frozen in June, there was no public announcement of the hold, as explained by the White House Counsel, to keep this from becoming a public issue while the White House monitored the progress and status of the transition in Ukraine."
"On August 27, Politico published an article that noted that the foreign aid had been held by the US."
This caused President Zelenskys office to reach out to the State Department and ask why.
"During the House impeachment proceedings, four of the House witnesses (Ambassador Voelker, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor, and Tim Morrison) all testified that the Ukrainian leadership learned about the temporary hold in aid after the Politico article was published."
The issue of the hold was also the first question from President Zelensky to Vice President Pence when they met September 1 in Poland.
"The idea that the leadership in Ukraine had pressure placed on them to do an investigation fails the most essential test, did the leadership of Ukraine even know that the aid was being held?"
"The answer from multiple American and Ukrainian leaders was no, they did not know there was a hold on the aid from the White House."
"You cannot have pressure to act on an investigation, if they did not even know the aid was being held."
"It is interesting to note, when I researched the records of past foreign aid payment dates and times to Ukraine, I found the 2019 aid was in line with the date the 2016, 2017, and 2018 aid was sent."
The vast majority of the military aid to Ukraine was obligated in August or September for the past four years.
"Though the aid was ready to go out the door a couple months earlier in 2019, it was certainly not late, based on the record of the previous three years."
"In fact, the State Department aid was obligated September 30 in 2019, but it was obligated September 28 in 2018."
"As quoted by the Ukrainian Minister of Defense, the aid was held such a short time, we did not even notice."
"During the two days of question-and-answer time, I asked a specific question related to this issue because I felt it was important to get the context of the aid, since there had been so much made of the issue during the trial."
Here is the full text of my question to the White House Counsel: House Managers have described any delay in military aid and state department funds to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the President.
"In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in September and in 2017, 73% of the funds were obligated in September."
"In the State Department, the funds were obligated September 30 in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 in 2018."
"Each year, the vast majority of the funds were obligated in the final month or days of the fiscal year."
Question: Was there a national security risk to Ukraine or the United States from the funds going out late in September in the two previous years?
Did it weaken our relationship with Ukraine because the vast majority of our aid was released in September each of the last three years?
"In response to my question, White House Counsel detailed the fact that military aid from the US was not for immediate use."
"It was designed to help the Ukrainian military buy materials for the next year, so it was common for the aid to be obligated at the end of the fiscal year (September 30), and it was also common for some money to be left unobligated and carried over into the next fiscal year, as it was in 2019."
"While it is easy to create an intricate story on the hold placed on foreign aid to Ukraine, it is also clear that President Trump has temporarily held foreign aid from multiple countries over the past two years, including: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Lebanon, and others."
"There is no question that a President can withhold aid for a short period of time, but it must be released by September 30, the end of the fiscal year, which it was in this instance."
"Constitutional Issues Around This Impeachment  Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants the US House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment, while Article I, Section 3 states that the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments."
The Constitution is clear that the House does not control the Senate process and the Senate does not control the House process.
"However, during the impeachment trial of President Trump, the House tried repeatedly to dictate to the Senate how it should conduct its trial."
"The sole power to try means laying out rules for the trial, including when and if to call additional witnesses or request more documents."
"In addition to laying out roles and responsibilities for impeachment, our Constitution also provides basic rights for the accused."
The Fifth Amendment ensures due process.
"However, the receipt of due process is not contingent upon waiving another right, like immunity or executive privilege."
But that is exactly what the House tried to force President Trump to do.
"The President is not above the law, but neither is the House of Representatives."
"If there was a question as to the scope and proper use of the Presidents right to assert immunity or executive privilege regarding conversations he had with his closest advisers, that question is proper for a court to determine, not Congress, and surely not the House on its own accord."
"To put this in constitutional terms, the Legislative Branch cannot prevent the Executive Branch from having access to the Judicial Branch."
The House wanted to move quickly and prevent the President from ever going to court to resolve any issue.
"That has never been done for a good reason, the separation of powers."
"In previous legal battles with the President, it has taken months to resolve critical issues, like Bush v. Gore in 2000 or even in the Clinton impeachment trial, when the House took two months to resolve an issue with witnesses in court."
It does not have to drag on for years.
"The House also wanted the Chief Justice of the United States to rule on any issue quickly, instead of allowing the President to go through the courts."
"This would have created a new judicial executive branch by putting all the judicial power of the nation in one person, not in the Judicial Branch, as is stated in the Constitution."
"It would have also ignored the text of the Constitution where it notes that the Chief Justice presides in the court of impeachment, not decides."
"The sole power of impeachment is in the Senate, not the Senate, plus the one Justice."
"The Chief Justice keeps the trial moving along, based on the rules of the trial, but he or she is not a decider of fact, that is reserved to the Senate."
The House Managers wanted to ignore that part of the Constitution to move the trial faster for expedience.
"We cannot ignore the Constitution or create bad precedent, no matter which party is being tried for impeachment."
"Further, the Sixth Amendment guarantees that the accused has the ability to both confront the witnesses against him and to have the assistance of counsel."
The majority of the impeachment inquiry in the House was done without a meaningful opportunity for the president to participate and administration witnesses were denied the ability to have counsel present for depositions.
"The Constitution lays out a clear separation of powers, but importantly also provides a system of checks and balances."
"For something as important as impeachment, it is imperative that the process be one that is squarely within the bounds of the Constitution and is one that the American people can trust."
"Unfortunately, the process undertaken by the House to impeach President Trump falls wildly short of the standards put in place by our Founders."
"Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution states that the President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."
"During the trial of President Trump, there was a lot of conversation about what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor."
"Notably, the House did not charge the President with any crimes."
"Rather, the House chose to impeach the President for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress."
"The House theoretically could have chosen to file articles of impeachment for crimes such as bribery, extortion, solicitation of interference in an election, or violations of the Impoundments Clause Act."
"For any of these crimes, the House would have had to prove specific elements of each."
"Since they couldnt prove any of those crimes, they chose to charge the President with abuse of power."
"As was noted in the trial, forty Presidents have faced accusation of abuse of power going back as far as George Washington."
The abuse of power charge for President Trump was based on allegations that he improperly withheld aid to Ukraine and conditioned a meeting with President Zelensky at the White House in exchange for an investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter.
"Over the course of the last four months, we heard the term quid pro quo used over and over again but the facts do not show criminal quid pro quo."
"As previously mentioned, President Zelensky asked to meet with President Trump in Poland and that meeting was set up."
"Further, while the aid to Ukraine was delayed, it wasnt delayed more than it had been the previous two years, and the aid was released without an investigation (or even an announcement of one) into the Bidens."
"The second article of impeachment, Obstruction of Congress, had an even weaker constitutional foundation."
"The investigation was announced September 24, but did not officially begin until October 31."
The impeachment vote in the House was December 18.
"This very short time table and the accusation that the President refused to follow the law, honor the courts and that he acted like a King did not meet even the most basic constitutional standards for justice."
"For example, during the Mueller investigation, the Presidents team fully cooperated with the investigation that included over 2,000 subpoenas and 500 witnesses, including the Presidents Chief of Staff, multiple cabinet officials and many lower-level officials that were all made available."
"It was clear throughout the investigation that the President did not like or agree with the Mueller investigation, but he also fully cooperated with every subpoena, each witness and every document."
"In fact, they released over a million pages of documents to the Mueller team."
"President Trump also made his disagreement with the courts very clear on issues like the census, whether travel restrictions can be put in place to ensure national security, or whether particular funds can be used to secure our southern border."
"But, each time the President lost in court, his Administration complied with orders from the Judiciary."
That is how our system of government is supposed to work.
"When disagreements happen between the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch, they usually lead to resolution, not impeachment."
"The Fast and Furious investigation, which lasted more than three years in the Obama Administration, led to a vote in the House to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, but it never led to an impeachment inquiry, even though there was a clear and consistent refusal to cooperate with Congress or turn over key documents for three years."
In this case the accusation that President Trump ignored subpoenas or refused to follow the law is not correct.
"The Presidents team made it very clear that they would cooperate during the impeachment inquiry with properly authorized and issued subpoenas, but the House refused to issue subpoenas that were consistent with the law to seek resolution for documents and witnesses."
"The House was focused on speed, not legal process."
"The House, in a rush to impeachment last fall, issued multiple subpoenas for documents and testimony before the House had given authority to the committees to issue subpoenas for an impeachment inquiry, which happened October 31."
"Since there was no authority to issue the subpoenas, they were not duly authorized."
The House also demanded testimony from the Presidents inner circle without working through the legal questions and the House demanded Executive Agency witnesses appear without allowing them to bring Agency counsel with them.
All of those issues created very real legal and constitutional problems.
"Agency individuals have always been allowed to have legal counsel with them when they are deposed, except this time."
"As a Member of Congress, I cannot demand the President turn over documents or give testimony in any fashion that I would prefer, just because I have oversight responsibilities."
"In the same way, the President or other Executive Branch officials cannot demand I turn over my notes or provide my staff for testimony without going through the courts and gaining a legal subpoena."
Congress has vigorously and rightfully protected its rights from unwarranted investigations from any president.
And presidents have done the same.
"But in all cases, the law must be followed and the proper process must be pursued to get the information in a legal way."
"Additional Witnesses  From the very first moments of the Senate trial, the House Managers fought for additional witnesses and documents from the President."
"Their argument, and justification for the second article of impeachment, centered on the White Houses refusal to turn over documents and make every witness available without going through the normal legal process."
"Per the resolution adopted by the Senate, the House record was part of the trial record."
The Senate had the testimony of the witnesses the House chose to question as part of the overall information of the trial.
"The House already had 28,000 pages of documents that were part of the evidence they submitted to the Senate."
"Although, the House Managers admitted during the Senate impeachment trial that they still have not released all of the documents and witness testimony that they had gathered in their investigation to the White House Counsel or to the Senate."
We do not fully know why the House held back some of its witness testimony and released others.
The House witness testimony was used extensively in the Senate trial.
"Witnesses who testified live or via video in the House and Senate Impeachment:  David Holmes, Political Counselor, US Embassy Ukraine, State Department Dr. Fiona Hill, White House Adviser, National Security Council David Hale, Undersecretary for Political Affairs, State Department Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union Tim Morison, Former White House Advisor Kurt Voelker, Former Special Envoy for Ukraine Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, National Security Council Jennifer Williams, Aide to the Vice President Marie Yovanovitch, Former Ambassador to Ukraine George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Bill Taylor, Former United States Ambassador to Ukraine  The House Managers repeated over and over that additional witnesses would only take a week to depose, which is a clearly false statement."
"New witnesses took longer than a week to depose in the House inquiry, clearly it would take just as long or longer in a Senate trial."
"The remaining wish list of witnesses all had clear issues that needed to be resolved in the courts, which would take a couple of months to resolve, which is why the House Managers did not push for their testimony in the House impeachment process, they valued speed more than legal process."
"House Managers repeatedly stated that witnesses only took a week to depose in the Clinton Senate impeachment trial, but they know that during the Clinton Senate trial all three called witnesses previously deposed in the House inquiry or in the Grand Jury investigation and all issues of Executive privilege had already been decided through the courts."
There were no new witnesses in the Senate trial of President Clinton.
"Also, the Clinton White House had already had the opportunity to cross examine witnesses or the investigators in the Clinton impeachment inquiry; this time the Trump White House had been denied that right."
"So, if new witnesses would be added for the Senate trial, the White House should have the right to also cross examine the previous House witnesses that they had been denied the right to cross examine in the past."
This would all take much longer than a week and the House Managers knew that.
"During the Clinton Impeachment trial in the Senate, there were no additional documents requested, only previously deposed witnesses."
"The House Managers did not go through the legal process to get documents, like the Mueller investigation had done, so all of the new document requests from the House Managers would take at least three to five weeks to complete, once a legal subpoena is delivered."
"It takes time to search all databases, review the documents for classified materials, determine any legal issues, and release them to the investigation."
"Once the documents are turned over, both legal teams need time to review the documents."
"Again, the House Managers knew these facts, but they continued to repeat over and over that it would only take a week to get all the documents."
The first question for the Senate trial was: do we have enough evidence and testimony to answer the questions the House presented in their articles of impeachment?
"If the answer is yes, then we do not need additional witnesses or documents."
"If the answer is no, then we do need additional information."
"There were many leaks and newspaper stories during the trial designed to push the Senate to vote to ask for more testimony, but that did not change the primary question."
"We already knew from evidence that there was no quid pro quo, no Ukrainian investigations and no withholding of a public meeting with President Trump."
The New York Times story on January 26 and again on January 31 are clear examples of an attempt to bring doubt on the information and witness testimony.
Both stories stated that someone had read the pending John Bolton book manuscript and that in the book Bolton stated that President Trump had talked about investigations in exchange for aid funding for Ukraine.
"The New York Times also wrote that the book would state that Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, were also a part of the scheme."
I looked at both stories closely and noticed that the reporters had not read the manuscripts or quoted the manuscripts; they were reports from someone who stated that they had read the manuscripts.
"Both stories took significant liberties to describe the intent in the manuscripts, but the reporter had apparently also not spoken to John Bolton."
"On January 23, 2020, the National Security Council lawyers sent a letter to the legal team handling the book publishing for John Bolton to inform him that the manuscript contained some classified information and it would need have some edits before publication in March."
"Then, on January 26, the New York Times published a story that someone had leaked some of the details of the book, but they had not released the actual manuscript."
"While I am interested in seeing the actual manuscript, I am also very aware that this selective leak was designed by TheNew York Times and whoever leaked the information to influence the ongoing trial."
It was clear from the earliest days of the trial that the House had a clear political strategy as well as a court-room strategy.
During the trial I had the responsibility to hear the facts but also to separate the politics from the facts.
"Politically, it was best for the House to move as quickly as possible through impeachment so that vulnerable Democratic members could vote for impeachment, and then move quickly to other topics."
"But since the presidential election is in full swing, it was politically better for Democrats to make the Senate trial move as slow as possible to hurt the President during the campaign."
That explains why the House did not take the time to formally request documents or testimony from many individuals; they needed to move fast and try to force the Senate to move slowly.
"It also explained why the House passed impeachment on a party line vote, then held the articles of impeachment for a month before delivering them to the Senate to start the trial."
The House Managers said repeatedly that the evidence was clear and that they had proved their case.
"But, if that was true, why would the Senate need to call additional witnesses?"
"I think the reason is that the witness process was about delay, more than facts."
"Final Thoughts  The facts do not support the accusation in the Trump impeachment, and it certainly did not need to come to this moment of national division."
"While, it was clear that the House Managers wanted to drag the trial on for months in the Senate, through the primary election season, their case consisted of hypothetical story lines and presumptions more than facts that warrant the removal of a President."
"This does not meet what Alexander Hamilton in Federalist, No."
65 described as the due weight for the arguments.
But impeachment has certainly created the division in our society that Alexander Hamilton predicted.
"Over 200 years ago he wrote, The prosecution [of impeachments], will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused."
This has been an incredibly divisive season in our nation.
"It is not about one person, it is about all of us."
"We individually choose how we handle disagreements with family, friends, and people on the other side of particular issues."
"Our government represents us, so it is up to us to model for our government how to handle disagreements."
"We are now past impeachment, and it's time to work on the issues that matter most to the American people."
"As we move forward, every American should speak out on the issues that are important to them and the voices that speak for their point of view."
"But, we should remember that we have much more in common than we have that divides us."
It is my hope that our nation does not go through a season like this again for a very long time and that we can move past this age of impeachment to an age of oversight and accountability.
I appreciate all the engagement with our office during the impeachment proceedings.
We had thousands of calls and emails over the past month.
We had hundreds of thousands of views on the nightly Facebook Live updates each day during the trial.
"While not every Oklahoman agrees with every decision I make on behalf of our state, I am grateful most choose to be respectful in expressing their points of view."
"At the end of the day, we are Oklahomans."
"We may not all agree on each issue, but we can be respectful of each other in our disagreement."
I am honored to serve our state and nation.

What a game; congratulations to our Super Bowl Champions.
The Presidents State of the Union address detailed the incredible accomplishments America has achieved in the last year.
Our middle class is booming and the unemployment rate is as low as its been in half a century.
"Seven million jobs have been created under his leadership, and in Missouri, real median household income is up eight percent."
"The economy continues to grow, lifting up working families and creating greater opportunities for the next generation."
"President Trump has said he would get to work for America, and he told us all how he has kept that promise."
"He has made it a priority to lower prescription drug costs, secure our border, and combat human trafficking."
"I will continue to work with him for our suburban families to advance critical initiatives such as passing paid parental leave legislation, addressing the skyrocketing costs of childcare, and ensuring our national security remains strong."
"Now that President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment, it is time Congress got back to the Peoples business of governing and build on his record of achievements for the American people."
Read my State of the Union press release here.
I introducedbipartisan legislation with my colleagues to help prevent repeated community flooding.
We must help regions at risk of repeat flooding become more resilient.
"By incentivizing communities to plan ahead for damaging floods, we can avoid continually subsidizing the rebuilding of flood-prone properties through the National Flood Insurance Program."
This bill aims to prevent loss of life and property and help communities withstand major floods like those we have recently experienced in Missouri.
Read more about the bill here.
Republicans introduced a privileged resolution to admonish the Speaker for ripping up the Presidents State of the Union address.
"Her action was a slap in the face to the President, the dignity of the House, and all of the Americans the President honored in his speech."
Democrats should allow us to vote on this legislation so they can go on record and tell the country whether they support such behavior or not.
"I had the honor of singing in the National Prayer Breakfast Congressional Choir with my colleagues.This is such a moving event, and I was blessed to attend."
It was great speaking to the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) to discuss our work in Congress against human trafficking.
"Financial institutions are critical partners in the fight against trafficking, and I look forward to working with banks, non-profits, and law enforcement as we find new ways to identify traffickers and help victims find justice."
I was honored to receive an award from ACAMS for my work in the fight against trafficking and appreciate their support and partnership.
"The purpose of U.S. global health and economic development programming is to recognize, promote, and protect the dignity of all individuals, and to extend a helping hand so that the marginalized, poor, and vulnerable around the world may build a better future."
Abortion is not compatible with this mission.
"Children and families should not be enumerated as barriers to prosperity, but seen as sources of strength, beauty, purpose, meaning, and potential."
We will not make the challenge of ending poverty a little simpler in the short term by pushing women to end the lives of their children.
"Instead, we will continue to ensure that all women and children have access to healthcare, opportunity, and success."
"During our Foreign Affairs hearing on women and global health, I asked our witnesses how we can better help women have both their baby and their dreams."
"We also discussed how abortion is a key driver of gendercide, the global epidemic of violence against women and girls."
I had a great visit with kids from Step Up St. Louis and the Jefferson County Drug Prevention Coalition to talk about the many ways they are working to educate students on the many dangers of addiction and how they can identify the signs.

"                        The Webster Wire Listening to Floridians Dear Friends:  President Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday was a compelling ""Great American Comeback"" story."
"Our country is stronger today than it has been in years - our economy, our military, our families, our environment, and our communities are stronger."
This is thanks in large part to three years of an administration that has made it a point to get government off the backs of hardworking Americans and put America first.
"Americans across the county are experiencing a ""blue-collar boom."""
"We have historically low unemployment, and more Americans are working today than ever before."
"Industries like construction, healthcare are adding jobs at a robust pace."
"Labor participation and wages are rising, especially for the bottom 10 percent of earners."
More than 2.5 million Americans have risen out of poverty.
"In Florida, 630,000 more jobs have been created."
Florida homeownership is up 3 percentage points.
"Real, per-capita income is up 7 percent since the Presidents election."
"From appointing judges who know and respect the U.S. Constitution; to improving the VA and veteran services; to reducing tax burdens on small business owners and taxpayers; to streamlining and removing unnecessary red-tape that blocked infrastructure investments; to improving our trade agreements for American workers, manufacturers and builders; securing our borders; to and rebuilding our military  President Trump has kept his promises."
The President also spoke of the bipartisan success that has been achieved in Washington when Democrats quit playing politics and come to the negotiating table.
"Under President Trump's administration, including USMCA and a phase One trade deal with China."
"Another bipartisan achievement is the ""First Step Act,"" which allows inmates serving for drug-related crimes to receive a second chance."
"I hope my colleagues  Democrat and Republican alike  will put aside politics and work together to invest in our countrys infrastructure, improve border security and reduce and prioritize spending."
President Trumps address also included compelling stories of Americans coming from all walks of life.
"These guests lives illustrate his inspiring message that ""Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!"""
"(Video of Guests)  _______________  On Friday, the Department of Labor released the January jobs report."
"Employers added 225,000 jobs in the first month of 2020."
"Perhaps more importantly, wages have increased 3.1% from last year."
This report smashes expectations and continues to show that policies reducing regulations and lowering taxes is getting people across the country back into the workforce.
The U.S. economy is positioned to fuel more economic growth this year.
"______________ President Trump's message to terrorists has been clear, ""You will never escape American justice."
"If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life."""
"On Thursday, our military conducted a counterterrorism operation in Yemen that successfully killed Qasim al-Rimi, founder and leader of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and deputy to al-Qa'ida top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri."
al-Rimi joined the terrorist group in the 1990s and worked for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
"Under al-Rimi, AQAP committed countless attacks against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire attacks against the United States."
His death damages AQAP and the al-Qa'ida regime and brings the U.S. closer to eliminating the threats these terror groups pose to our national security.
"_______________  Each year, the U.S. Congress hosts the Congressional Art Competition."
This unique competition allows me to showcase the artistic talents of high school students within the 11thDistrict.
"The winning entries from each district are prominently displayed in the Cannon Tunnel to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C."
"The competition is open to high school students only, including home educated students."
"Each student may enter one piece of artwork that illustrates this years theme, the ""Wonders of Florida."""
"For guidelines, deadlines and more specific information, please visit my website."
(2019 Congressional Art Competition Winner)  _______________  Cindy Brown from my local office recently attended The Villages Giving Clubs Showcase.
"The purpose of this event is to showcase the many clubs, organizations, and groups that work to give back to our community, our region, and the world at large."
At least 36 clubs participated.
One of the clubs was Angel Snugs from the Villages.
"Jen Smith and Bonnie Mulneix - leaders of The Villages Angel Snugs club, showcased their mission to teach volunteers to knit, crochet and loom hats."
These items are then shipped to 80 pediatric hospitals around the country to help comfort children that have lost their hair due to chemotherapy cancer treatments.
"_______________  Last week, my District Director Christa Pearson participated in the First Annual Hernando Grown Student Conference."
She spoke to Hernando County high school students about their next steps in achieving their educational and career goals after high school.
Thank you and congratulations to all involved in a great inaugural event!
"Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress   Constituent Corner A member of the Florida Army National Guard stated that he never received the reenlistment signing bonus he had agreed to when renewing his contract in February 2019."
Our office inquired into the situation and learned that a recent backlog had been cleared and that the payment was scheduled to be applied to his retirement fund.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you.
District Update Pam Jones from my local office attended the American Heart Association Wear Red for Heart Health along with UF Health Leesburg Hospital.
Wear Red for Heart Health is the American Heart Associations yearly campaign to raise awareness for women to act against their number 1 killer  heart disease.
"Dr. Michelle Wood, who is an obstetriciangynecologist in Leesburg was the guest speaker and shared tips on heart health for women."
Legislative Update Last week the House passed H.R.
"2382, the USPS Fairness Act."
"This bill repeals a mandate from the 2006 passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which required the USPS to fully pre-fund future retiree health care benefits."
This requirement is unique to the USPS and has financially crippled the postal service.
"By removing this mandate, the USPS has the flexibility to use revenues to improve services and compete while still funding retirement benefits in a sustainable manner."
I am a strong supporter of the USPS and a co-sponsor of this bill.
This legislation now moves onto the U.S. Senate for consideration.
    NewsFrom Congressman Ben Cline                    Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline  The Senate's acquittal of President Trump and the State of the Union grabbed most of the headlines this week.
I was proud to stand in defense of citizens' right-to-work and opposed legislation seeking to force people to join a labor union to get or keep a job.
It was also a pleasure to have so many different groups from across the Sixth District join me in Washington this week to advocate for the issues they care most about.
"With impeachment officially behind us, I am hopeful Congress can move past partisanship and spend the next year working for the American people."
"President Acquitted:  From the beginning, Speaker Pelosi said that impeachment must be compelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan."
"However, the impeachment of President Trump did not possess any of these qualities."
"The flawed and rushed process conducted in the House, coupled with the lack of evidence required to prove high crimes and misdemeanors, made the acquittal of President Trump by the Senate appropriate and necessary."
"The impeachment process in the House was a sham, and it set a dangerous precedent that we must reject moving forward."
Never again can we allow one political party to use impeachment as a tool for political gain.
This entire process has been little more than an attempt by Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election and the will of 63 million Americans  all while denying the President his right to due process.
"The partisanship displayed by some of my colleagues has fueled the rancor and division within this country, and this entire display of political theater will forever be remembered as a sad stain on the House of Representatives."
"After wasting months focusing on impeachment, I am hopeful that Congress can now get back to work on issues important to the American people, including improving our Nations infrastructure and highways, supporting our military and veterans programs, securing our border and preventing the flood of drugs and human trafficking that has flowed across it, and finding solutions to bring down the costs of health insurance and prescription drugs."
"State of the Union: After an eventful few months, President Trump gave his annual address to a joint session of Congress this week."
He delivered a message that Americans already knew - that the state of our union is strong.
"Throughout his speech, he laid out a forward-looking and optimistic agenda that will lead to the continued prosperity of this Nation."
"Over the course of the last three years, President Trump and his Administration have accomplished a great deal for the American people."
"Above all, President Trump's commitment to cutting bureaucratic red-tape has allowed businesses to thrive and the economy to flourish."
"Since his swearing in, the United States has added more than 7 million new jobs and a record 160 million people are currently in the workforce."
"Many of these new jobs have been in the manufacturing sector - a result of more than 12,000 factories opening their doors throughout the President's term."
"Further, unemployment currently stands at or near-fifty-year lows, including record lows among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Women, and Veterans."
"The President's landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created opportunity zones to encourage investment in low-income areas, which have lifted nearly 2.5 million Americans out of poverty and risen the median wage for middle-class families by $5,000 a year."
These economic victories can also be seen right here in Virginia.
"Our Commonwealth's unemployment rate stands at 2.6 percent - a result of the 120,000 new jobs created in the state since President Trump took office.Unemployment insurance claims are down 22 percent since his election andreal median household income in Virginia is up 12 percent."
"The 212 opportunity zones designated in our state havelifted 137,000 Virginians out of poverty and have inspired hope in our struggling communities."
"While the economic success our Nation has seen during this Administration is immense, President Trump has secured countless other victories for our country."
"Not only has he signed new trade deals like USMCA and the Phase One agreement with China, but he has also made significant progress in securing our border, passed historic criminal justice reform legislation, stood for pro-life values, enhanced vocational education, strengthened our military, and taken out numerous terrorists abroad ensuring the safety and security of our Nation."
Protecting the Right to Organize Act:  This country was founded so that all Americans could have the opportunity to succeed.
"One way that we promote this is through policies and laws that allow people the right to work, which in turn makes us more competitive in the business market."
"Thankfully, our Commonwealth is a right-to-work state."
"And because of this, Virginia was once again ranked as the number one state in which to do business in 2019 by CNBC."
"2474, which passed the House this week, would inappropriately preempt and prohibit right-to-work laws in 27 states that value and protect this fundamental right."
This is unacceptable.
"In an even further affront to liberty, this bill abhorrently violates the privacy of workers by forcing them to share their personal contact information with union organizers, even when this has been shown to enable harassment and intimidation of those very workers."
"If signed into law, this bill would have grave impacts on workers and businesses at great cost to the fabric of our workforce."
Every American deserves the right to create their own success from their own volition  free of the requirement that they join an organization solely to hold a job.
"Simply put, as our Founding Father and fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson said, To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical."
I voted against this bill to protect Virginia workers and stand for the freedom and success in which our Founding Fathers believed.
"Sixth District in DC:  It is truly always a pleasure to host Sixth District residents in Washington, D.C.        Rep. Cline Meets with members of the VA Farm Credit          Rep. Cline meets with Sixth District advocates from the Community from the Anti-Drug Coalitions of America          Rep. Cline meets with members of the VA Rural Water Association          Rep. Cline meets withKen Garren, President - University of Lynchburg    Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman."
"If my office can ever be of assistance, please contact my Washington office at(202) 225-5431."
"       News from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                          February 9, 2020     Dear Friend,  In last weeks State of the Union address, President Trump outlined the many accomplishments that have been secured during the past three years."
"I am proud of these results, particularly as it relates to our thriving economy and how it is working to the benefit all Americans."
"I was disheartened by the behavior of some of my colleagues, which I found to be a stain on the rich history of our institution and a poor example for our children."
What unites us as Americans is greater than our division and we must work together in a civil manner to find common ground.
"Additionally, last week the Senate finally brought to a close a partisan, politically-motivated charade."
"There are many important issues facing our country, and the time for putting this distraction behind us is long overdue."
I will continue to work with my colleagues to build consensus on the issues that matter most to our community and that will improve the lives of those I serve.
Strengthening our Economy  Last weeks State of the Union address highlighted our great economic success story.
Here are just a few examples in Florida.
The most recent Jobs Report contains more good news about the strength of the American economy.
"More than 225,000 jobs were added in January and the jobless rate was 3.6%."
"Additionally, wages are up 3.1% when compared to last January."
"For the past 18 consecutive months, average pay has grown at an annual pace of 3% or higher."
We must continue to support pro-growth policies.
"Last week, I voted against the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act because it is exactly the kind of legislation that would cripple our economy."
"While it may sound well intentioned, its impact would be devastating."
We currently have a record low unemployment rate because we have created a climate that allows small businesses to thrive.
Small businesses are the backbone of our nations economy.
"When they are free to innovate and compete in the free market, jobs are created and wages rise."
"Additionally, it was an honor to be recognized last week by the U.S. Travel Association for my work to reauthorize the Brand USA program."
This public-private partnership has a solid record of attracting international tourists to the U.S. without costing the taxpayers a dime.
"Given that tourism is so important to the state of Florida's economy, passage of my bill was a priority."
Fighting for our Heroes  I'm continuing to work in a bipartisan manner to improve Veterans' access to benefits and ensure resources are used as efficiently as possible in order to meet the needs of our nation's heroes.
This article outlines a bill I co-authored last week to help accomplish this goal.
In last weeks VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee Hearing we discussed a variety of draft bills to help improve educational opportunities for Veterans.
Click here to listen to my remarks during the hearing.
"Last week, a bill I cosponsored passed the House."
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act creates a pilot program within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help combat Veterans address mental health issues by pairing them with dogs to train as service animals.
The bill directs the VA to provide grants to nonprofits that teach Veterans to train service dogs.
"Upon completion of the program, Veterans can, if they wish, adopt their dogs for ongoing therapy."
This is one small part of the work Ive been doing to help Veterans gain access to alternative and complementary therapies.
One size does not fit all when it comes to an issue as sensitive as addressing the mental health needs of our nations heroes and they deserve access to every type of treatment that has proven effective.
"Additionally, several constituents have called my office recently asking for an update on the Zephyrhills VA Clinic."
"I received the following update from the VA Leadership Team:  ""The design phase took longer than anticipated due to strict VA guidelines for clinic construction, but the builder was able to make up some time and we are on track for clinic construction completion by the end of 2020 and full clinic activation in fall 2021."
"Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs  I was glad to hear the President call for bipartisan solutions for lowering prescription drug prices, something that has been a priority for me."
HR 19 has over 40 provisions that have widespread bipartisan support.
Lets bring that bill to the Floor immediately.
Protecting Public Health   Fentanyl analogues are extremely dangerous and have been proven to be deadly for many Americans.
"While the Speaker waited until the deadline to extend this critical ban, I am glad the President was finally able to sign legislation that maintains the strictest safeguards to protect against abuse of this highly potent narcotic."
The current outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has dominated news headlines.
"As I mentioned last week, it is important to remain calm."
"The virus originated in China but has now spread internationally, impacting an increasing number of countries."
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is taking the necessary precautions to protect the American public.
"However, the CDC always recommends everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including the following tips:   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing."
"If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
"Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands."
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
"Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash."
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Visit the CDC website to learn more about prevention strategies.
Improving Transparency  We have been calling on FEMA to approve the updated flood maps for several years.
Im glad to see they will be implemented in just a few months because homeowners deserve an accurate and transparent process.
Praying for the Future of Our Nation  It was an honor to attend last week's National Prayer Breakfast.
My prayer is that the leaders of our great nation will come together in unity to solve the problems that impact the daily lives of those we serve.
"I ask God to give leaders at all levels the humility, strength and grace to rise above division and prioritize the needs of our citizens."
Raising Awareness  Black History month allows us the opportunity to celebrate all of the unique contributions that African Americans have made to strengthen our nation.
"February is also American Heart Month, a perfect time to learn how to prevent heart disease and keep #OurHearts healthy."
"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women, but is largely preventable."
"The most common type of heart disease affects 1,441,000 people in Florida."
Click here to learn what you can do to protect your heart.
Constituent Corner  Last week I received a call from a constituent in Holiday who thanked me for helping her father solve a problem with incorrect Social Security payments.
They had been working with the Social Security Administration for more than 5 months.
"After calling my office, his problem was resolved within one week."
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
"During last week's economic development meeting hosted by the North Tampa Bay Chamber, my team received an update from the Department of Transportation on current and anticipated transportation projects."
Increased congestion is a major concern for all us who call the Tampa Bay area home.
It is important that we continue to tackle the problem and develop solutions on a regional basis.
"Last weekend, my team had the chance to speak to the Pasco County Housing Authority's Family Self Sufficiency Graduating Class."
This wonderful program empowers families who want to transition from public housing to home ownership.
"Their stories are truly inspiring, and I wish them great success as they embrace the American dream."
"Additionally, my team had the privilege of judging the Pasco County Science and Engineering Showcase."
It is great to see students being exposed to a challenging STEM curriculum that encourages scientific discovery.
These young students certainly have a bright future ahead.
Thank you for reading this weeks update.

"        News from Congressman Austin Scott                  HOME MEET AUSTIN HELP CENTER ISSUES CONTACT                   Dear Friend, For months, House Democrats wasted time and taxpayer resources on a partisan impeachment process against the President fueled by their hatred for him."
"This past week, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump and proved what weve been saying all along  there were no facts nor evidence to support impeachment."
"I have asked from the beginning, ""What was the crime?"""
The U.S. Senate has just answered that question.
Democrats wasted months on a partisan impeachment fueled by their hatred for President Trump.
"THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG  This past week, President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address."
"During his speech, the President reiterated that the state of our union is strong  our economy continues to grow, more Americans are back to work, our military remains the best fighting force in the world, and U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses have a more level playing field in our global markets."
"Following the Presidents speech, I sent out a poll to hear from constituents on how well they thought the President delivered his policy agenda and the top issues from his address that were important to you.Below are the results of our poll."
"If you missed the survey, you can click here to take it now."
"You can also call my Washington, D.C. office to express your opinions, or send me an email through my website by clicking here."
"If you missed his State of the Union address, you can watch here."
"MEETING WITH SPECIALTY AG GROUPS  This week, I had the opportunity to meet with National Sorghum Producers Association and the National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance to hear their concerns on issues facing each respective industry."
I look forward to continuing to meet with ag groups from across our country to learn more about their unique challenges as I run to lead to the House Agriculture Committees Republican side next Congress.
I appreciate the National Sorghum Producers Association meeting with me to discuss trade and reforms to crop insurance programs.
"During my meeting with the National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance, we discussed disaster programs and how we can enhance them."

"Facebook (Twitter (YouTube (Website (Friends, It was a historic week in Washington D.C. which included the Senate putting an end to the Democrats' impeachment sham, the President delivering an inspiring State of the Union address, and a January jobs report that blew estimates out of the water with 225,000 jobs added in the first month of 2020."
"On Tuesday, President Trump's State of the Union address championed the ""Great American Comeback,"" a bold and hopeful vision for the future of our nation."
House Republicans have successfully worked with the Trump Administration to deliver a new era of American strength and prosperity.
"The President highlighted the historically strong economy that is benefiting families in Wyoming and across the country: * 3.5% unemployment rate, the lowest in 50 years * U.S. consumer confidence at highest levels since 2000 * Highest level of entrepreneurial activity recorded in the last two decades * Median household family incomes grown by nearly 8 percent under President Trump Additionally, the President reaffirmed his commitment to Americas military and our leadership around the world."
"The guests he invited, stories he told, and policies he outlined reminded us of all that is best about America."
Click on the video below to watch my interview with Fox Business previewing the State of the Union address.
"In stark contrast, Democrats' response to the positive vision outlined by President Trump in the State of the Union was disgraceful, but unsurprising."
"Between their members staging an episode of political theater by walking (out (, to refusing to applaud common-sense accomplishments (like awarding scholarships to students that need them or lowering unemployment rates for disabled veterans, they showed their true colors."
"At the conclusion of the speech, Speaker Pelosi had a tantrum, disgraced herself, and dishonored the House by ripping up a copy of President Trump's speech (."
She is an embarrassment and should apologize to the American people for her behavior.
"On Wednesday morning, I joined Wyomings Lets Talk With Al Harris (on KUGR 1490 AM to recap the State of the Union Address."
"We touched on the inspiring stories of the Presidents guests including a Tuskegee Airman, a young girl receiving a scholarship for school, and a soldier returning home to his family."
We also discussed how the President has successfully rebuilt our military and enhanced our national security by taking out terrorist leaders Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Qassem Soleimoni.
Click below to listen to the full interview.
"Rep. Liz Cheney Joins Let's Talk With Al Harris  February 5, 2020 On Wednesday, Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, did the right thing in voting to acquit President Trump of the Democrats' articles of impeachment."
This effort was political from day one and Democrats' goal to impeach the President began the day he was inaugurated.
"When House Democrats launched their formal impeachment inquiry, they completely denied due process or fairness."
"Democrats then rushed the process, putting their political timeline before any legitimate search for truth or the facts."
"Throughout the process, Democrats ground all of the nations business to a halt, preventing Congress from focusing on the issues that matter to the American people because of this partisan impeachment."
The country will hold Democrat leaders accountable for abandoning the Constitution and abdicating their oaths of office.
"Democrats proved that they cannot be trusted to put their responsibility to the country before their political self-interest, and that is something the American people will long remember."
"As a member of the House leadership team, I was proud to help lead the fight against the impeachment sham and uphold our Constitution."
"On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Interior announced (it would provide nearly $36 million to Wyoming this year in Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation grants, to clean up and repurpose abandoned coal mines."
"As the nations leading coal producer and largest contributor to the AML fund, Wyomings coal communities rightly deserve these critical resources."
"These grants, which I have fought hard to protect, support investment in reclamation projects and leading-edge technologies like carbon capture."
These hard-earned funds will create new economic opportunities while enhancing Wyoming's land and water resources.
"Congresswoman Liz Cheney ** Natural Resources Committee ------------------------------------------------------------ * The Western Caucus recently announced that my legislation (, the Increasing Access and Multiple Use Act, will be part of a package of bills (aimed at modernizing the Endanger Species Act (ESA)."
My provision would provide certainty for permit and leaseholders on public lands.
Livestock producers have long battled against the federal governments attempts to reduce grazing on public lands.
"My bill is crucial to safeguarding ranchers, who legally graze on federal lands, from frivolous lawsuits that force them off their allotments, leaving them no choice other than to sell their livestock at fire-sale prices and subjecting them to economic ruin."
My proposal ensures they will be able to continue to graze on public lands as they have for generations and it fulfills the intended mission of the multiple-use doctrine by protecting the interests of stakeholders in Wyoming.
"These reforms, in addition to the other pieces of legislation included in this package, are key to modernizing the ESA and bringing it into the 21st century."
"* Earlier this month, I introduced the Creating Opportunities And Leveraging Technologies for Coal Carbon Act ((COAL TeCC), legislation to establish a carbon technologies program at the Department of Energy (DOE) to advance research for coal-driven carbon products."
"As the nations largest coal-producing state, the people of Wyoming know that coal is more than just a critical energy source."
"New technologies have opened up unlimited applications for coal as a carbon-based product used in automobile frames, airplanes, electronic devices, and plastics."
"The unique composition of coal has the potential to create stronger, lighter, and less expensive carbon-based materials, providing coal communities in Wyoming with an important source of jobs and revenue."
Investing in carbon-based technology and research strengthens the reality of coal as one of Americas most versatile and valuable natural resources.
"** Armed Services Committee ------------------------------------------------------------ * On Monday, I joined Congressman Michael McCaul, the lead Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to introduce a resolution denouncing the United Kingdoms decision (to allow Huawei to build part of their 5G networks."
I've been a leading voice (in fighting back against the Chinese Communist Party-controlled telecommunications companys attempts to infiltrate and spy on Americas allies.
Allowing Huawei into the U.K.s 5G networks would pose a national security threat that could not be mitigated or contained.
"I've also joined my colleague, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, i (n introducing a bill (that would bar the U.S. from sharing intelligence with any country that allows Huawei into its 5G networks."
"* Last week, President Trump outlined his vision (to help create peace, prosperity, and a brighter future for Israel and the Palestinian people."
"The plan put forward by the President is a historic step towards bringing peace, security, and prosperity to a region that has long endured conflict and turmoil."
President Trumps plan re-affirms Americas unwavering commitment to the security and survival of the state of Israel and establishes a path forward for the Palestinian people to turn away from terrorism and embrace a future of freedom and prosperity.
"I applaud the President and his team for their commitment to working with our allies to bring peace, security, and prosperity to a troubled region."

"The president kicked off the week with the State of the Union Address, then on Wednesday the Senate voted to acquit President Trump, and on Thursday, the president spoke at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, which I was blessed to attend."

"Stands Up for Religious Dog Tags After Pentagon Caved to Secularist Group, The Washington Free Beacon  Greg Steube Wants Armed Forces Personnel to Have Concealed Carry Permits at Military Bases, Florida Daily  Legislative Update The Safe Bases Act Last week, I introduced the Safe Bases Act to give the Department of Defense the authority to issue concealed carry permits for active duty members of the Armed Forces who wish to carry on military installations."
"As we saw in the recent tragedy in Pensacola, gun free zones are a threat to our safetyeven in the most secure environments."
"Active duty service members, who have extensive firearm training, should be afforded the opportunity to carry a concealed firearm to defend themselves and others."
"If we trust them on the battlefield with military equipment and firearms, then we should trust them at home on their installations to defend themselves and civilians working with them."
"Moving H-2A to USDA Act On Thursday, I introduced the Moving H-2A to USDA Act to relocate the H-2A visa program from the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor to the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture."
Farmers across Florida rely on the H-2A visa program each year for temporary agricultural labor.
"Given that the purpose of the H-2A program is to address agricultural labor needs, it seems only logical that we would rely on the Department of Agriculture to review and grant these visas."
"It is my hope that with the transfer of this program, farmers in Florida and across America will see expedited review times and an overall improvement in the administration of the program."
Its time we trust the experts to manage this critical program and ensure the needs of our farmers are being met efficiently and effectively.
This Week in Washington We kicked off this week in Washington with the Presidents State of the Union Address.
"With wages rising, unemployment dropping, and the economy booming, I am happy to say that the State of our Union is prosperous."
The policies proposed by this administration are working for Floridians and Americans and I applaud the president for his steadfast commitment to making America great!
"After the speech, I spoke with media from across my district about the important issues the president addressed and my takeaways from the evening."
"Watch one of my interviews here:    On Wednesday, the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump."
I applaud the Senate for their decisive action to acquit the president.
"Since the president was elected, Democrats have stopped at nothing to remove him from office because they know they cant beat him at the ballot box."
"Thankfully, the voters will have the final say on all of this in November."
"I am hopeful that with this acquittal, we can move forward and get to the business of the American people by addressing real issues facing our nation."
"This week, I also had the privilege to attend the National Prayer Breakfast with President Trump and many other members of Congress."
This is such a special event where we have the opportunity to celebrate our faith and the many blessings the Lord has bestowed upon our great nation.
"I was joined by my wife, Jennifer, and our dear friends Belinda and Bill Aubuchon from Nokomis and I even got to sing in the choir!"
"In addition to all of the special events this week, I also met with many wonderful Floridians who were visiting Washington, D.C."
I was proud to accept the Council on Residential Excellence (CORE) Award from the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches.
I also met with the Florida Chiropractic Association to discuss Medicare reform and other important issues facing their industry.
It was an honor hosting students from the Port Charlotte Simon Youth Academy during their visit to Washington!

President Trump delivered his third State of the Union address  an uplifting celebration of the diversity of the American experience and the triumph of the American spirit.
"The terrorist leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, who claimed to have orchestrated the NAS Pensacola shooting, has been eliminated."
"Finally, and at long last, the sham impeachment trial has come to an end, and President Trump has been acquitted."
"Now that impeachment is finally over, will House Democrats get back to work for the American people?"
"(The answer, unfortunately, seems to beno.)"
"TERRORIST KILLED On Sunday, Qasim al-Rimi, a cofounder of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack at NAS Pensacola in December."
"On Thursday, February 6, the White House announced that Qasim al-Rimi was dead."
"On behalf of the thousands of patriots in Northwest Florida, I thank President Trump for his swift action in eliminating this brutal terrorist."
"During his State of the Union address, the President stated that any assault on our freedom would be met with overwhelming, disproportionate retribution."
He has kept his word.
"We are a safer, stronger nation tonight because of his leadership."
"STATE OF THE UNION On the night of Tuesday, February 4, the President delivered his third State of the Union address."
President Trump opened up his speech by declaring that the state of our union is stronger than ever before.
"Wages are growing to new highs, the economy is soaring, and unemployment is at a 50-year low."
"Our nation has prospered greatly since President Trump took office, and his policies have led to success for ALL Americans."
The Presidents remarks were uplifting and triumphant.
"It was a moving address, and well worth watching."
"Unfortunately, the conclusion of the speech was overshadowed by a political stunt from Speaker Pelosi."
"PELOSIS DISGRACE At the conclusion of the Presidents State of the Union address, while he received thunderous applause and a standing ovation, the Speaker took her copy of his prepared remarks and tore them in half."
"It is hard to overlook the symbolism of such a gesture  the sense that Speaker Pelosi was utterly dismissive of the Presidents achievements and guests, and, more importantly, the achievements and success of the American people."
"Speaker Pelosis gesture reflects poorly on her Speakership, and on the House of Representatives as a whole."
The Speaker should not let her personal feelings about the President color her behavior as a leader in the United States Congress.
This behavior is utterly unbecoming of the Speaker of the House.
"I have sent a letter to the House Committee on Ethics, asking that they investigate the matter, and recommending that they censure the Speaker."
"Tearing up this document was certainly distasteful  and was likely illegal, too."
"A section of federal law () states that Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys [] any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office [] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both."
"Unlike the copies of the State of the Union address available elsewhere, Speaker Pelosis was an original, hand-signed copy."
"During State of the Union addresses, the President hand-delivers a copy of his remarks to the Speaker of the House, and to the President of the Senate (the Vice President)."
"Those two copies are the original documents, from which all subsequent copies are made."
They are not the personal property of the recipients.
They are the property of Congress.
"There is no question whatsoever that Speaker Pelosi mutilated, obliterated, or destroyed the copy of the Presidents address provided to her at the beginning of the evening."
The video evidence is clear and abundant; the Speaker herself gleefully acknowledged her actions.
The Speaker cannot be above the law.
"On Thursday night, I joined Laura Ingraham to discuss my letter to the Committee on Ethics."
Watch it here:        Click to play!
"PRESIDENT ACQUITTED Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced an impeachment inquiry five months ago, but the impeachment investigation really began many months before that."
"For nearly a year, Democrats have been wasting Congresss time, energy, and resources  with little to show for their efforts except heartburn."
"If impeachment had not consumed Democrats every waking moment, we could have had many bipartisan successes  from lowering prescription drug prices to rebuilding Americas infrastructure."
"Unfortunately, that hasnt been the case."
"My Republican colleagues and I have been preaching that this was a political stunt since the beginning  and on Wednesday, February 5, we were proved right, when the Senate concluded its impeachment trial and voted to acquit the President on both of the baseless charges levied against him."
"Of the 248 Republican members of the House and Senate, only one voted to convict the President."
Mitt Romney chose pettiness and jealousy over objectivity.
"We saw extreme moderates such as Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins vote to exonerate the President."
"This illustrates with clarity that this impeachment was purely political, and Romneys vote was borne of bitterness, not principle."
"I am glad to put this national nightmare behind us, and hope that Congress will finally get back to working to help the American people."
AROUND THE DISTRICT CHILDCARE FOR OUR HEROES The military families in our district sacrifice a great deal for America.
But one sacrifice they should not have to make is childcare.
"Many military parents must drive to Eglin Air Force Base for childcare, which can add hours onto their daily commute."
"Our military personnel protect our families, and we must return the favor."
"Not only does a lengthy and difficult commute hurt our military families, it also impacts our military readiness."
"The intense nature of the Special Forces Group demands the complete attention of participants, and when our operators are thinking about the strain on their families at home, they are not focused on their mission."
"This week, I wrote a letter with Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio to urge to Secretary McCarthy to address the lack of childcare facilities for the 7thSpecial Forces Group."
I look forward to hearing from the Secretary and lightening the burden for Northwest Floridas warfighters.
Read the letter here:      JOSEPH AINSWORTH ACT Military veterans are the heartbeat of Northwest Florida.
"Under current law, veterans whose net worth exceeds a certain threshold are ineligible for pension benefits."
"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) calculates a veterans net worth by evaluating the sum of the veterans assets, plus their annual income."
"If that value exceeds the limitation the VA has set, the veteran is not eligible to receive pension benefits."
"This week, I introduced the Joseph Ainsworth Act along with fellow Florida representatives Ross Spano and Darren Soto."
"This bill would eliminate the Net Worth Limitation for veterans over 99 years of age  allowing centenarian veterans to qualify for full pension benefits from the VA, regardless of their net worth."
Eliminating this rule for our military heroes who have achieved such a milestone in their life will help alleviate the financial burdens they and their families frequently endure.
"Furthermore, it also helps show our nations gratitude for these veterans devotion to America."
"It is my hope that First Lieutenant Joseph Ainsworths situation will be eradicated for future centenarian military veterans, and that his service to our country will be immortalized through this legislation."
A copy of the Joseph Ainsworth Act is available HERE.
VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT The military is not a feature of our district  it is the defining characteristic.
"Northwest Florida has been built by the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect America, and our cherished American values: freedom, justice, and the rule of law."
Its easy to walk down the street and forget how lucky we are to live amongst heroes.
"Since the Library of Congress started the Veterans History Project in 200, over 6,000 Floridians have submitted their stories, but I know there are more out there."
"This week, we continued our efforts to uncover more of these stories."
I look forward to hearing more about the lives of the men and women who have made our country great.
"For more information, please visit my website:     OPEN GAETZ DAY   On Friday, February 21, I am excited to hosting the first Open Gaetz Day of 2020!"

                    THE HAGEDORN REPORT:January Recap It was a busy January in Minnesota and DC.
"Congressman Hagedorn is pleased to report that hardworking southern Minnesotans have benefited from a number of achievements in January, including final passage of the USMCA and Phase One of the U.S.-China Trade Agreement being signed by the president."
"These trade wins mean protecting our jobs and better market access for our agriculture, manufacturing and medical products."
"The 2019 final jobs report reflects this sentiment as well, showing near record low unemployment and rising wages in Minnesota."
"Jims small contractors legislation also passed the House in January, making our small businesses more competitive when bidding for prime contracts."
"Additionally, Hagedorn has now completed 16 of the 21 stops on his district-wide Town Hall Tour, which is set to be complete in February."
"Rep. Hagedorn started off the month of February by focusing efforts on expanding working families access to affordable, quality childcare services by signing on as an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Small Business Child Care Investment Act."
This legislation works to expand access to childcare by granting non-profit childcare providers access to the same types ofSmall Business Administration (SBA) loans available to for-profit companies.

"Good News From the FCC For rural areas such as ours, safe and reliable methods of telecommunications are vital."
"We count on them to stay connected with each other, foster new economic opportunities, and engage with the wider world."
"In the House of Representatives, where I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over telecommunications, I fight to make sure communities such as ours are properly served."
The agency charged with carrying out the telecommunications laws passed by Congress is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
"It regulates radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable communications in the United States."
"In recent weeks, it has taken several encouraging steps that will contribute to expanded and improved telecommunications services in the Ninth Congressional District of Virginia."
"Broadband Broadband Internet service is indispensable for job creation, education, and various other activities in the modern world, but many sparsely populated communities are not connected."
"Closing the digital divide between rural and urban areas is a necessity, and to help achieve this goal, the FCC at its January 30 meeting established the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund."
Its goal is to direct $20.4 billion over the next ten years to building fast broadband networks in unserved rural areas.
"The first phase of this plan will begin later this year, with $16 billion in funding going to areas that are not served at all."
"Virginia has an estimated 217,000 home and business locations that would be eligible for Phase I of the funding."
"Subsequently, $4.4 billion will be made available to support areas that enjoy partial service."
This planned investment by the FCC marks a significant commitment to addressing the needs of rural areas.
"Still better, more good news on broadband may be on the way."
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has announced a plan for new rules around television white spaces to be considered at the commissions February meeting.
TV white spaces are unused spectrum between stations.
"They can be adapted for other purposes, including providing broadband services in rural areas."
"Chairman Pais plan would change the FCCs rules on white spaces, enhancing the ability of innovators to use them for broadband delivery."
More investment and greater flexibility to use white spaces will help connect rural areas.
What are some of the possible benefits?
More appeal to businesses and job creators to locate here.
Greater availability to educational resources.
Aid to farmers via precision agriculture.
"I will note in particular one benefit: increased use of telehealth, which can make it easier for patients to check in with their health care providers and thus support better outcomes."
"I have championed telehealth as a health care solution in our area, and the FCC last year even made the announcement in Carroll County of its plans for a $100 million Connected Care Pilot Program."
Better broadband access will also serve the purpose of expanding telehealths reach.
"The FCC under Chairman Pai has shown a true commitment to closing the digital divide, and I applaud their efforts."
"Robocalls In contrast to broadband, where the problem is a lack of access, the problem with our telephones lately is that they are being abused by illegal robocalls."
This was a problem that received bipartisan attention in Congress and in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
"We passed the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act last year, and President Trump signed it into law."
The FCC is one of the agencies charged with executing this law.
It has urged phone companies to allow tracing of robocalls from foreign sources and moved toward selecting an entity to lead efforts in the private sector to trace illegal robocalls.
"The U.S. Department of Justice, which also has responsibility to enforce the TRACED Act, filed actions against entities facilitating illegal robocalls."
These actions are important.
"Although passage of the TRACED Act was a significant achievement against illegal robocalls, it will not get rid of them overnight."
Success will depend on enforcement.
I am glad to see federal agencies taking steps to carry out the law.
"If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office."
"                               This week, after theSenates vote to acquit President Trump of all impeachment charges, Senator Rick Scott announced aconstitutional amendment that would raise the threshold to approve articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives."
"The amendment would require a super-majority vote of three-fifths in the House to impeach a public official  Senator Rick Scott said, ""The partisan charade Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats made of this impeachment process over the last few months shows that the fears of our Founding Fathers were realized."
They warned that impeachment could be used as a partisan tool by partisan actors.
"The Democrats used the impeachment process as a tool to hurt President Trump, regardless of the outcome of the Senate trial."
Its a dangerous precedent and the process has to change.
Our country should never again have to suffer from this partisan hackery.
An act as divisive as impeachment must have bipartisan backing and overwhelming support.
It should be harder  much harder  for either political party to take the process our Founders created as a last resort against a tyrannical leader and use it instead as a tool for the tyranny of a political majority.
"I look forward to all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, joining me in this effort to protect the integrity of our nation and our constitution."
"Also this week, Senator Rick Scott cosponsored the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act toestablish 9-8-8 as the universal telephone number for a national suicide prevention and mental-health crisis hotline."

Hong Kong Democracy Activist Nathan Law to Join Sen. Rick Scott as Guest at State of the Union  Senator Rick Scott announced Nathan Law as his guest to the President's State of the Union Address.
"Nathan Law is the founding Chair of Demosisto, a youth activist group in Hong Kong that promotes freedom and democracy."
"Nathan was forcefully unseated as a Hong Kong lawmaker under suppression from Communist China, and is currently a Yale graduate student."
"Senator Rick Scott said, I am honored to have Nathan as my guest at the State of the Union."
"Nathan is an inspiration in the fight for freedom and democracy, and he has sent a powerful message to Communist China that the people of Hong Kong will not back down or be silenced."
The United States will always stand with fighters like Nathan to rise up against injustice and fight for freedom.
"We cannot let Communist China and General Secretary Xi continue to silence the people of Hong Kong, and the world must stand together to present a unified front against Communist Chinas aggression."

"Sen. Rick Scott to EU: Do More to Enforce Sanctions on Maduro Regime  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following reports that Spains Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos met with Maduros illegitimate vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez, in Spain this week."
Members of Maduros ruthless regime are banned from entering the European Union (EU).
"During Senator Scotts meeting with Interim President Juan Guaido on Saturday, Senator Scott discussed the need for the EU to do more to enforce sanctions against the Maduro regime."
"Senator Rick Scott said, I called on the EU to join the United States and do more to help the Venezuelan people, and I was encouraged when the EU joined as a partner in this worldwide fight against evil."
But allowing a Maduro official to enter the EU shows they are not strongly enforcing their own sanctions.
"If we are serious about helping the people of Venezuela and getting Maduro to step aside, the EU needs to do a better job of enforcing their sanctions."
"And Spain, as a member of the EU, needs to do their part and not allow members of its government to legitimize Maduros regime."
"Europe, the United States and freedom-loving nations around the world need to do everything in our power to isolate Maduro in Venezuela and cut off the supply of money from Cuba to Caracas.Read more HERE."

"El senador Rick Scott dijo: Le hice un llamado a la UE a unirse a los Estados Unidos y hacer ms para ayudar al pueblo venezolano, y me anim cuando la UE se uni como socio en esta lucha mundial contra el mal."
Pero permitir que un funcionario de Maduro ingrese a la UE muestra que no estn aplicando fuertemente sus propias sanciones.
"Deben hacer ms. Si tomamos en serio ayudar a la gente de Venezuela y lograr que Maduro se retire del poder, la UE debe hacer un mejor trabajo y hacer cumplir sus sanciones."
"Espaa, como miembro de la UE, debe hacer su parte y no permitir que los miembros de su gobierno legitimen el rgimen de Maduro."
La gente se est muriendo.
"Europa, los Estados Unidos y las naciones amantes de la libertad en todo el mundo deben hacer todo lo que est a nuestro alcance para aislar a Maduro en Venezuela y cortar el suministro de dinero desde Cuba a Caracas.Lea ms AQU."

Im glad that charade is over.
Lets get back to work.
Sen. Rick Scott in USA Today: Its Time to Raise the Threshold of Impeachment in the House of Representatives  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed in USA Today making the case for his constitutional amendment to raise the threshold to approve articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives.
The amendment would require a super-majority vote of three-fifths in the House to impeach a public official.
The current threshold is a simple majority.
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, ""Our Founding Fathers feared that impeachment would be used as a partisan tool by partisan actors."
"In the impeachment of President Donald Trump, their fears have been realized."
"Pelosis impeachment circus has shown that bad-faith partisans will use the impeachment process as a tool to hurt their political opponents, no matter the outcome of the Senate trial."
Its a dangerous precedent.
House majorities have no reason to prove  or even attempt to prove  their case if their goal is to simply use impeachment as a political attack against the president.
"Its wrong, and the process needs to change."
It should be harder  much harder  for either political party to take the process our Founders created as a last resort against a tyrannical leader and use it instead as a tool for the tyranny of a political majority.

"       WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS  On February 4th, Congress gathered to hear President Trumps third State of the Union address."
"This year, we need to make progress on top priority issues for Americans like the opioid epidemic, criminal justice reform, and mental health care."
"As your representative, I will keep working to get things done for Marylanders."
"Heres what I focused on last week:  Last Monday, I paid tribute to Holocaust Remembrance Day on the House floor and mourned the six million Jews that were murdered in this genocide."
This year also marks 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.
"There alone, 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed."
Holocaust Remembrance Day serves as reminder of what depravity humans are capable of when we dont make it a priority to end intolerance.
"Today and every day, we must continue the fight against hatred."
"Last Wednesday, I presided over the House floor during the debate on a bill that would temporarily ban fentanyl analogs."
"In 2018, synthetic substances like fentanyl were involved in approximately  of all opioid overdose deaths."
Were fighting to keep these dangerous drugs off of the streets.
"Later in the day, I was proud to help the House pass this bill."
"Now, I am calling on the President to sign it into law and keep vulnerable Americans safe."
"The following day, the Maryland Legislature voted to override Governor Hogans veto of Delegate Nick Mosbys ban the box legislation."
The legislation would prevent employers from requiring an applicant to disclose whether they have a criminal record before their first in-person interview.
"All too often, returning citizens are passed up for jobs because of their backgrounds."
Recent studies indicate that between 60 and 75 percent of the formerly incarcerated remain unemployed up to a year after their release.
This just isnt right.
Banning the box in Maryland is a victory for our state and for the hardworking returning citizens that are building better lives for themselves and their families.
"Rep. Trone visits Carmens Corner Store, a business in Hagerstown run by Mark Wilks, a returning citizen."
"EVENTS  On Tuesday, my office put on a Seniors Workshop in Hagerstown."
"I had a wonderful afternoon talking to constituents and hearing from experts about how to navigate some of the biggest issues our seniors are facing today, like skyrocketing prescription drug costs."
Ill keep fighting so that no Maryland is forced to empty their bank account to fulfill their basic needs.
Thank you for a great and informative afternoon!

"                                Dear Friend,   The weekly newsletter is a great way to stay up-to-date on the work I'm doing on behalf of our Valley."
I use this as a venue to tell the story of how the work I'm doing in Washington and in the district impacts you.
"Each week I will highlight important pieces of legislation I'm working on, show you how I'm engaging with constituents on the issues, and tell you about upcoming events in the district.This week I'm back in Washington working on important legislation to improve public access to water in the Valley."
Here are some highlights:   Fighting for water    Water is the lifeblood of our Valley.
Farmers need water to feed the world and life becomes near impossible for residents who lack clean drinking water.
I introduced a bill to provide funding for necessary repairs to the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct.
"These waterways are critical to supporting our Valley's water needs, yet they are decades old and showing their age."
"We need to invest in our water infrastructure now, for the future sustainability of our state."
"Expanding healthcare access             California is expected to face a massive shortfall of primary care doctors in the next 15 years, especially in rural and low-income communities.I recently introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act to increase our supply of doctors by providing funding for additional medical training in diverse and medically deprived communities, like the San Joaquin Valley."
"At this year's State of the Union, I invited one of our local dedicated Valley health professionals to be my guest:Enid Picart.A fourth year medical student at UCSF-Fresno, Enid has chosen to dedicate her career to improving healthcare for San Joaquin Valley residents."
"We need more passionate people like Enid, who know our communities, to stay and commit to our future."
"With an investment in them, we can ensure every Valley resident has access to the healthcare they deserve."
Rep. Costa with State of the Union guest Enid Picart.
"Honoring a hometown hero             I introduced a resolution to honorapioneer in the Latino community and Fresno native, Tom Flores, and urge he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."
Coach Flores was recently passed over forthe honor despite his noteworthy achievements in the sport.
"As the first Latino starting quarterback andhead coach to win two Super Bowls with the Raiders, andfirst Latino head coach andgeneral manager of the Seattle Seahawks and in professional football history, his accomplishments on the gridiron prove he ismorethandeserving of this honor."
Improving Valley infrastructure    I'm pleased to announce that Merced County is opening Phase II of Campus Parkway and breaking ground on Phase III.
"When completed, this vital infrastructure project will connect UC Merced to both Highway 140 and Highway 99, improving traffic circulation, andproviding betteraccess to health services and economic opportunity."
Working together in a bipartisan effort is key to improving our Valley's infrastructure.
"Supporting global women's health    As a strong supporter of reproductive rights throughout my career, I believe it is critical for the United States to fund programs that improve the lives of millions of women around the world."
"In a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, we discussed the Global Gag Rule and other policies of this Administration to restrict access to family planning tools."
Many of these policies have undermined the United States' commitment to global public health and resulted in economic and physical harm to women around the globe.
Pushing for responsible forest management    One of my top priorities is to see our taxpayer dollars come back to the district.
I'm pleased to report that the Fresno Regional Workforce and Development Board (FRWDB) secured an important CalFire grant to improve the health of our forests.
Wildfires in California continue to have devastating impacts on our economy and air quality in the Valley.
This new partnership will create 100 new skilled forestry jobs to help alleviate these effects.
"If we are to combat these growing threats, we need to bolster our efforts to responsibly manage our forests."
Other work on behalf of our Valley:  Voted to advance  that would provide funding to counter the damage Nutria are doing to our waterways in California.
about how legislation I helped introduce willfor disadvantaged communities.
The bill would alsoto increase storage and supply in our Valley.
to expand services and benefits to victims of Agent Orange exposure.
Meeting of the Week:    It's always a pleasure to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
"This year at the United Nations Holocaust Observance, we had a productive discussion about building the relationship between the UN and our government in Washington, the UN's role in combating the climate crisis, and working to improve collaboration with our transatlantic partners."
I will continue working with the UN and other nations around the world to promote global peace and prosperity.

"The Presidents emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, and Ive been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district."
"I am especially proud that President Trump announced his public support for my bicameral, bipartisan voluntary paid leave bill for hardworking families that does not increase taxes or create a new government program.This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy."
"This effort is yet another example of the critical, bipartisan work in Congress that I am proud to lead with the support of my colleagues."
"During his remarks, President Trump also surprised the family of Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams with his unexpected return from deployment in Afghanistan."
"Sergeant Williams is originally a native of Peru, New York."
He is also a past Peru Fire Department Firefighter.
"I am proud that Sergeant Williams hails from the North Country, and it was incredible to witness him and his family reunite as they were honored for the sacrifices they have made in the name of our freedom."
"I thank Sergeant Williams for his service, and I am proud that President Trump reaffirmed his support for our military families."
"I was also proud to have David Fisher, dairy farmer from St. Lawrence County, accompany me to the State of the Union as my guest."
"David and the Fisher family have been operating Mapleview Dairy for four generations in Madrid, New York."
"David has been an active member of his community, serving on the Madrid Town Board for many years, and is currently also in his second term as President of the New York Farm Bureau."
He has been an outspoken advocate for farmers in the North Country.
"He is well versed on agriculture issues and always makes sure that Upstate New York agriculture has a seat at the table, particularly on results like the USMCA."
It was great to have him in the audience.
"Statement on the Acquittal of President Trump  This week, the impeachment charade started by Speaker Pelosi, abused by Adam Schiff, and finished by Leader McConnell has finally come to a close."
"Throughout this unfair and unprecedented process, I proudly stood up for the Constitution, the facts of the case, and my constituents in New Yorks 21st district."
I applaud the Senates diligence in their trial and just acquittal of the President.
I'm looking forward to getting back to work for the American people.
Meeting with Constituents and Organizations Important to the North Country        It was great to meet with a variety of constituent groups and organizations important to my work on behalf of the North Country this week.
"I discussed the importance of rural broadband, funding for students with disabilities, and school safety with the New York State School Board Association."
"I met with the North Country Workforce Development Board leadership about increasing access to affordable child care, workforce development priorities, and helping dislocated workers and rehabilitated former non-violent offenders successfully reenter the workforce."
I also met with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to discuss prison reform and funding for the drug free communities program.
We also discussed the vaping epidemic facing our youth and the need for funding to go towards addiction prevention and education.
It is always great to meet with constituents from the district and discuss the issues most important to them.
Hearing directly from my constituents guides my work and priorities in Congress.
"Opposing New York State Law Causing Suspension of Global Entry, Trusted Traveler Programs for New York Residents  This week, in response to New York States Green Light Law, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced their decision to suspend enrollment in Global Entry and other trusted-traveler programs for New York State residents."
"The Green Light Law, which took effect in December 2019, allows issuance of a drivers license to illegal immigrants."
"In making their decision, DHS cited that the states sanctuary policies that safeguard immigrants from deportation."
"DHS will immediately stop accepting new applications from New York State residents to enroll or re-enroll in some of the agencys travel programs, including Global Entry."
New York is the only state to be impacted by DHSs decision thus far.
"After repeatedly ignoring law enforcement experts at the federal and local level, Governor Cuomos prioritization of illegal immigrants over law abiding New Yorkers is continuing to have damaging effects."
"The Governors reckless Green Light Law not only has hampered efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, it is continuing to have harmful implications for our state."
"In December of last year, I warned Governor Cuomo that this irresponsible policy would inhibit our CBP officers at the Northern Border from doing their jobs."
"Qualified, legal citizens should not be penalized by the Governors unconscionable actions, which not only hinder our border patrol, law enforcement, and other agencies from being able to effectively do their job, but now also prevent our residents from receiving access to important travel programs."
"Helping the House Pass the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act  This week, I voted in favor of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, legislation that I proudly cosponsored."
This bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) and helps meet the needs of communities by increasing funding and reauthorizes the program through the next five years.
"Over the past decade, the GLRI has assisted Great Lakes communities after decades of environmental damage threatened public health, regional economies, and drinking water."
The GLRI has enabled the 8-state region along the Great Lakes to undertake one of the worlds largest freshwater ecosystem restoration projects.
"Assisting our communities in cleaning up their drinking water systems, restoring fish and wildlife habitats, and combating invasive species are critical examples of how this GLRI funding benefits North Country communities."
"This funding plays an essential role in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes and the ecosystems that surround them, and I am proud to continue to advocate in full support of its projects."
Leading Coordination with State and Local Officials to Support Fort Drum Designation as Army Corps Headquarters    Fort Drum is now one of the three final options for designation as a fourth Army Corps headquarters.
"I am proud to be leading the effort in coordinating support between local and state elected officials, community groups, and local businesses in the area surrounding Fort Drum to advocate for the installations selection as the final site."
"I sent a letter to the Army advocating for Fort Drum's designation, and led many petitions, signed by hundreds of constituents with more signing on each day, in support of the stationing and activation of the additional headquarters at Fort Drum."
My offices have worked closely with Advocate Drum to coordinate an outpouring of support from the North Country.
"Fort Drum is the best option for the activation and stationing of the Armys fourth corps headquarters, and I am proud to be passionately advocating for this alongside my constituents."
"As the number one advocate for Fort Drum, I have worked tirelessly to lead the coordination efforts across the North Country, to build support for the Armys consideration."
I will continue to raise awareness that Fort Drum has unmatched capabilities and ready to rapidly expand to meet the criteria to support an Army corps headquarters.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:     ___________________  Featured Read:  Watertown Daily Times -President references Stefanik legislation in SOTU address  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said President Donald Trump delivered an incredibly strong State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he highlighted the Congresswomans legislation on paid leave and child tax credit.The Presidents emphasis on our strong economy, unwavering support for our military, and the signing of the USMCA into law are critically important to the North Country, Ms. Stefanik said after the address, and Ive been honored to work with him on delivering these results to my district.During the address, Mr. Trump said he was proud to sign a law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave."
"And he called on Congress to pass the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, which he said would extend family leave to mothers and fathers across the nation."
"Im grateful President Trump highlighted my bipartisan, bicameral legislation during his State of the Union address, Ms. Stefanik said."
"This legislation will support hardworking North Country families during the first year after birth or adoption, allowing them to thrive and bond with their new child without the burden of potential debt or bankruptcy.Ms."
"Stefanik said the act would allow families the option to advance up to $5,000 of their recently-doubled child tax credit in the first year of a childs life or the first year a family adopts a child."
"Most other paid leave proposals require parents to take off work to receive benefits, a release from Ms. Stefanik said."
This bill allows teleworkers the option to access child care benefits and to continue working from home while they take care of their new child.
The bill does not raise taxes or take away from Social Security.
"It is the product of more than a year of work to craft a bill that could pass with bipartisan support, the release said."

"As a member of the bipartisan Save Minor League Baseball Task Force, Im working to keep our team in Binghamton."
WORKING TO END VETERAN SUICIDE: One Veteran life lost to suicide is too many.
The VA needs to do better to address the needs of our rural Veterans.
"In our Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on Veteran suicide, I asked VA officials what they are doing to ensure Veterans in rural communities like ours have access to the mental health resources they earned."
"If you or a Veteran you know is struggling, call the National Veteran Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 and press 1."
LISTENING TO FARMERS: Had a productive discussion with our Agriculture Advisory Committee in Broome County about ways we can work together to helpNY-22farmers succeed.

"                      New Year Updates                 Palmer's Perspective ""The truth is incontrovertible."
"Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is."""
Winston Churchill  I think the above quote may well describe the hope that many of us have for the state of politics in America and our ability to govern.
"Truth and common sense are under assault as the Socialist majority in the House of Representatives continues to mislead the American public in an attempt to gain full control of our government, and ultimately of our futures."
"There are so many issues on which Democrats are refusing to acknowledge the truth, but there are a few that have been particularly glaring within the first few weeks of this new year."
"False attacks against President Trump have been relentless, even to the point of condemning the killing of one of Americas most ruthless enemies."
"President Trumps decision to give the order for our military to kill Qasem Soleimani, the head of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, should have been lauded by Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat colleagues as a fully justified strike to protect Americans and our allies."
Both parties should have supported it and reinforced that it was a needed warning to other terrorists.
"But, bolstered by the left-wing media, prominent Democrat politicians staunchly refused to acknowledge that this was a good decision from President Trump, even seeming to openly side with Irans oppressive governmentand characterizing Soleimani as a reasonable and admired leader in Iran."
"The truth is that Soleimani was a ruthless despotresponsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including hundreds of Americans."
"While Democrats and leftist media condemned President Trump for his actions, freedom-seeking Iranians who suffered the cruelty and terror of Soleimani were celebrating in the streets."
"Whats more, after a months-long miscarriage of justice in an effort to impeach President Trump, Speaker Pelosi sent articles of impeachment to the Senate, knowing full well that there was little chance of removal from office."
The Senate has now voted to fully acquit President Trump.
There was never evidence that the President committed an impeachable offense.
President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine both repeatedly said that there was no connection between foreign aid and an investigation and that there was no pressure.
"Chairman Schiff lied repeatedly throughout the process and continues to lie, evenabout his lies."
"In my opinion and the opinion of many others, what Speaker Pelosi and her hand-picked co-conspirators did was a massive abuse of power that would have undermined future elections and would have led to a Constitutional crisis."
Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues also continue trying to convince American families and workers that they are worse off now compared to before President Trump took office.
The evidence points to the exact opposite.
Indicator after indicator has shown how much better off people from all income levels are.
"Median household income is up, taxes are lower, regulations are less burdensome and costly, energy costs are down, and unemployment is at a record low."
"And, finally, the Democrats in the House still refuse to acknowledge the right to life for unborn children.For years pro-life men, women and children have peacefully gathered in Washington to speak up for the rights of unborn children."
"Every year that I have been a member of Congress, Congress has been in session during the week of the March for Life."
"This year, Speaker Pelosi chose for the House to recess during the week of the March for Life."
Democrats have also repeatedly refused even to vote on legislation that would protect children after they are born following an attempted abortion.
"This issue is perhaps where truth has been denied the most strenuously for decades, and we must continue to fight."
I am very grateful for all the people from Alabama and from all across America who are courageously and compassionately standing up for the lives of unborn children.
"In sum, the events of the last several weeks have left me with deep concernfor where our countryis headed."
"Theyve revealed to me that there are Democrat members of Congress who genuinely believe President Trump was wrong to kill Soleimani, who believe the government should take away your right to make your own health care decisions, who want to destroy the ability of people to make a good living, and who are pro-death, even for babies that survive an abortion attempt."
"I pray that the American people will recognize that the future is in the balance, stand with us to get our nation back on the right track, and who will fight for the truth, even when it is denied and attacked."
"Press Talks Washington Times: I'm thankful for the opportunity to contribute a piece to the Washington Times about Iran, the killing of Qasem Soleimani, and the actions that led to that decision."
"Alabama's Morning News with JT: Impeachment has now moved to the Senate, but the process is still riddled with falsehoods and injustice."
I enjoyed talking with JT and giving the latest perspective and updates on the impeachment proceedings.
The bottom line: the facts haven't changed!
Talk 99.5 with Matt  Aunie: It's always a good time when I can talk with Matt and Aunie.
"In this conversation, we discussed where the impeachment proceedingsare headed from here, the 2020 elections coming up, and how past failings in foreign policies contributed to recent actions in Iran."
The Jeff Poor Show: It was great to catch up with Jeff Poor about the situation in Iran and on where the impeachment trial stands in the Senate.
In the District Constituent Highlight: Many congratulations to Sheriff John Samaniego for his recent appointment to the President's new Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice!
Sheriff Samaniego has served Alabama's Sixth District with honor and I'm confident he will continue to do so in this prestigious new position.
New I-59/I-20 Interstate Bridges: The new bridges for I-59 and I-20 have been officially completed and opened!
I was glad to be able to speak at the opening and to be part of the ribbon cutting.
This is an important milestone for Birmingham and I trust the new bridges will serve central business district well.
The project began in 2015 and cost $700 million.
The NO Bill of the Month No War Against Iran Act(H.R.
"5543, amendment to H.R."
550)  This legislation is in keeping with many Democrats' stringent denial of facts regarding Iran policy.
It is one more part of their effort to paint President Trump's order to kill Soleimani as reckless and unfair.
"In reality, both Iranians and Americans are safer with Soleimani out of the picture, and this billonly addsneedless restrictions."
"It would limit the accessibility of funds for using military force in Iran, and it tries to restrict the President's decision-making power when it comes to engaging in conflict with Iran."
The War Powers Act of 1973 already put a check on the President's power when it comes to military force and declaring war.
"In short, this legislation tries to restrict the President's ability to defend the American people from a regime that consistently supports terrorism and provokes conflict in the Middle East."
"The only reason for this bill is the Democrats' disdain for anything President Trump does, even when he takes out a terrorist."
It was very easy for me to vote no on this legislation.
"Hearing Highlights In the continued obsession with finding somethingillegal to pin on President Trump, the Transportation and InfrastructureCommittee held another hearing about the Trump Hotel lease and alleged violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution."
The hotel has been used as yet another weapon in the relentless attacks against the President instead of turning attention to the many pressing issues that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee could focus on.
I made these concerns clear in my questions and also made the point that paying a market rate for a hotel room is not what the Founders had in mind when they put in place measures to limit foreign influence from emoluments.
The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee recently held a hearing on water resources and related projects.
I expressed my concernregarding a huge backlog of proposals on water infrastructure.
I was grateful for the chance to discuss this with the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Watch my questions here.
Floor Action Floor Speech:Here arethe remarks I made in opposition to impeachment just before Christmas.
"The concerns I expressed then still hold now, and I hope the Senate will summarily dismiss the articles."
"                                              Dear Lindsey,  Last night, Cadott grain and dairy farmer Les Danielson joined me for the State of the Union to share a message with President Trump: Keep your promises and deliver results for Wisconsin farmers before its too late."
Les has been farming for 30 years in northwest Wisconsin.
"A member of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, Les has witnessed firsthand as dairy farms have gone out of business throughout the state since President Trump took office, including one only three miles from his farm in Cadott."
Les is concerned about the future of agriculture for his children and family farmers as President Trumps trade wars and tariffs have produced tough times for Wisconsin farmers.
Its time for President Trump to move past empty promises and outline a clear plan to get the job done for farmers like Les.
That is why Im continuing my work to keep the pressure on in Washington and do right by Wisconsin farmers and our agriculture economy.
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I worked last year to secure $20 million for my Dairy Business Innovation Initiative, as well as $10 million to provide our nations farmers and agricultural workers with more mental health resources as they work through these stressful times."
Ive also introduced bipartisan legislation to help combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products.
"Imitation products have gotten away with using dairys good name for their own benefit, which is against the law and must be enforced."
My DAIRY PRIDE Acttakes a stand for dairy farmers in Wisconsin who work tirelessly every day to ensure that their milk meets high standards for nutritional value and quality.
Im going to keep my promises and continue working in the Senate to get the job done for farmers like Les so that we can strengthen our Made in Wisconsin agriculture economy.
"                        CONTACT  MEDIA                Dear Friend, This week, President Trump gave his third State of the Union address."
He outlined the Great American Comeback story that he and his Administration have led.
"During the speech, he laid out an optimistic vision about how we can continue this progress and build a better future for all."
Continuing reading to see my full statement on the State of the Union speech.
"Today, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump on the partisan articles of impeachment sent to them by House Democrats."
Congress has been tied up for months with the House Democrats impeachment obsession.
Partisan politics need to be put aside.
Its long past time to put this impeachment charade behind us and get back to work for the American people.
State of the Union President Trump continues to put America first and advance the interests of our nation.
The strong economy under this administration is lifting Americans everywhere.
"This administration successfully negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which created 176,000 new jobs, added $68 billion in new economic growth and was a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses."
He also delivered on a historic Phase One trade agreement with China.
I was happy to hear the President speak on the jobs created in the opportunity zones established in the Republican tax cut bill.
"In Georgia, 260 opportunity zones have attracted investments  including in Muscogee County  and brought new economic opportunities to our local community."
This administration has made tremendous progress in fixing our broken immigration system and securing our border.
I was pleased to hear the Presidents plans to continue building a safe and legal immigration system by facing head-on the public safety threat posed by sanctuary cities.
"The Presidents remarks on issues facing working families, from ensuring that every child can get a great education, to supporting Americas parents as they manage the demands of their careers while raising children were also commendable."
"While the Democrats continue to embrace socialist healthcare policies, the President thoughtfully laid out his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs while maintaining the highest standard of care and access to the most innovative cures."
President Trump has kept his promises and America is strong once again.
"As he made clear in his remarks, there are many opportunities for Congress to help Americans and keep our nation moving forward."
"I remain committed to working with President Trump, his administration and my colleagues in Congress to continue to grow our 21st century economy and create an environment that ensures opportunity for all."

"As always, it is an honor to serve all of you in Georgia's Third District!"
"Since you won't get them in the State of the Union, here are some facts on the Trump economy By Rep. Don Beyer  February 4, 2020 When the president gives his State of the Union address this week, I expect him to demand credit for our strong economy."
"Doubtless, he will chalk it up to his supposed business acumen."
History tells us much of what he says will be false or misleading.
The president told a lie recently in a speech at Davos that we should expect to hear again: that the economy he inherited from Barack Obama was in dismal shape.
"He said that the current economy is booming due to his magic touchnot because Barack Obama helped dig us out from the worst recession since the Great Depression, or because of the hard work and ingenuity of American businesses and workers."
This is revisionist historyfar from the truth.
"Its one of more than 1,500 lies or misleading statements President Trump has made since his inauguration on the economy alone, according to The Washington Post Fact Checker."
"He has made more than 16,000 false or deceptive statements on all issues combined."
Was the economy a wreck as the president imagines?
Did his tax cuts supercharge economic growth?
Has the presidents trade war helped American businesses and consumers?
The evidence shows these assertions are absolutely falseand that in some ways Trump economic policy has done more harm than good.
Lets look at the facts.
"When President Trump took office, the economy was strong and getting stronger."
Unemployment had been cut by more than half and stood at 4.7 percent.
The economy had added jobs for 76 straight months.
"Wages were rising, inflation was low, GDP growth was solid."
To call this dismal is ridiculously dishonest.
"In important ways, the economy under Donald Trump has lagged behind the economy under Barack Obama."
"Lets look at job growthin the first 35 months of the Trump administration, the economy added about 191,000 jobs per month."
"In the last 35 months of the Obama administration, approximately 227,000 jobs were created each month."
"Thats 36,000 fewer jobs each month under Trump."
"How about business investment, which is key to long-term economic growth?"
"The Republican tax cuts, the presidents signature legislative accomplishment, were supposed to accelerate investment."
But growth in business investment has slowed after a small initial bump and it now has declined for three consecutive quarters.
GDP growth also has disappointed.
The president promised that his nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts would be like rocket fuel for the economy.
GDP growth would be as high as 6 percent!
But that hasnt happenedthe rocket fuel didnt power the economy skyward.
"Annual GDP growth has not reached 3 percent since the tax cuts were enacted, and it slowed to 2.3 percent in 2019."
Part of the challenge is that the presidents trade war has created headwinds for the economy.
It has harmed everyone from American suppliers to farmers to wholesalers to retailers to consumers.
"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the administrations trade policies will shave 0.5 percent from GDP this year and reduce average household income by nearly $1,300."
"Finally, there is the cost of the tax giveawaysthe increase to our national debt."
The president and his advisers promised that their 2017 tax cuts would pay for themselves.
There was extensive reporting on the second year anniversary of the tax cuts in December that this claim has proven false.
"However, just last week, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin doubled down on this myth."
CBO estimates that the tax cuts will add $1.9 trillion to our national debt.
"Deficits already have rocketed higher, from $585 billion during the last year of the Obama administration to $984 billion in 2019."
CBO forecasts the deficit will reach $1 trillion this year and an average $1.3 trillion between 2021 and 2030.
These fast-growing deficits when the economy is strong constrain investments we should be making in education and infrastructure now and will limit our fiscal response when we have to confront the next recession.
I suspect that these facts wont make it into the presidents State of the Union Address.
"As with so many other subjects, he will have alternative facts."
"Even though his version of reality has been proven to be fanciful, he will continue to claim that he inherited a dismal economy from Barack Obama and that he has worked miracles."
This isnt remotely true.
"The fact checkers are going to be very, very busy."

USMCA will provide much-needed certainty and stability so that our economy can continue to thrive.
"Since I first arrived in Congress, securing this agreement has been a top priority and I worked tirelessly to ensure Congressional leaders knew how important this was to Texas."
"Texas is a top trade state and USMCA will bolster trade with Mexico and Canada, which supports more than 36,000 jobs right here in North Texas."
"Additionally, by strengthening worker protections, USMCA will shift the paradigm and create a new standard for future trade agreements."
"Throughout this process, it was important to me to hear from those most affected by the trade agreement."
"I talked to businesses big and small, as well as workers and economic experts from across North Texas, and held roundtables and town halls on this important topic."
"Rep. Allred with David and Patti Mitchell and the staff of Mitchell enterprises, an HVAC company in Richardson that depends on trade for their operations."
I also worked tirelessly behind the scenes to urge my colleagues tasked with negotiating this deal to get something done this year.
"In addition, I met with government officials from Mexico as well as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on several occasions to convey the importance of this agreement to North Texas."
I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for putting partisan politics aside to deliver for the American people and do the job we were elected to do.

I am encouraged that their framework included many things that are also important to my Republican colleagues and me.
"Historically, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has worked in a bipartisan manner to develop and pass legislation that prioritizes and invests in our nations infrastructure."

"Legislative Update This week the House passed S. 153, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act."
This legislation directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish an interagency working group to coordinate federal programs and policies for transitioning veterans and military spouses into STEM careers.
It also directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a plan to increase outreach to veterans.
STEM education is essential and getting our veterans involved in these programs is a great way to bring them into the workforce after their service.

"BLACK HISTORY MONTH:    As we enter into Black History Month, I reflect on the life and legacy of Shirley Chisholm who has had a great impact on my own life."

"            Wickers JROTC Act Provides New Opportunities High School Cadets More Likely to Graduate, Attend College  The experience of serving in Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) programs can have real benefits."
"A Rand Corporation study found that students who participate in JROTC have higher grades, better attendance rates, and are more likely to graduate from high school than other students."
I introduced legislation in 2018 to expand the availability of JROTC programs to more high schools across the country.
The JROTC Opportunities for Transformational Change Act of 2018 authorized funding and reforms to add 100 new units at schools in rural and underserved areas.
The bill was included in the defense authorization act and became law with President Trumps signature.
"Two years later, this law is continuing to expand opportunities for communities and young people."
"I am pleased to report that last years defense bill built on my 2018 proposal by setting a minimum requirement of 3,700 units nationwide in 10 years."
Achieving this baseline will add 188 more units than exist today.
"Each of these new programs will provide young leaders lessons about service, character, and citizenship while encouraging better health and wellness."
Success of Mississippi Cadets Inspires Positive Change  Mississippi is a prime example of the impact a JROTC unit can have on a community.
"In fact, it was the success of students enrolled in JROTC programs in our state capital that originally inspired me to introduce legislation to expand these programs to other schools."
"The Jackson Public School system, a district facing significant challenges, includes seven schools that host JROTC units."
"Across these schools in 2018, 90 percent of graduating seniors who participated in JROTC were accepted to an institution of higher learning and received more than $7.5 million in scholarship offers."
"Outcomes clearly are better for students who participate in these programs, but more programs are needed."
"Before my legislation, funding was flat or declining for JROTC, and hundreds of high schools were on the waitlist for a unit."
We are now closing the gap.
Support for Rural and Underserved Communities  The JROTC Act is also working to improve the availability of enhanced opportunities where they are needed most  in rural and other low-income communities.
Five times as many urban schools have a unit compared to rural schools.
Only three percent of high schools with fewer than 500 students have a JROTC unit.
This divide puts students from rural states like Mississippi at a distinct disadvantage.
"To address this problem, the JROTC Act prioritizes new programs for schools in underserved areas."
"It also gives high schools greater flexibility in hiring instructors, which can often be a challenge in small communities."
"As an ROTC cadet in college, I know firsthand the benefits of a military education experience while in school."
"Numerous other military, business, and government leaders can trace their success to a JROTC or ROTC program, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Housing Secretary Ben Carson, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, entrepreneur Sam Walton, and football legend Lou Holtz."

"              Dear friend,  I am honored to have a constituent and proud veteran, Elton Johnson, Jr., join me as my guest to the State of the Union."
"Elton was Lieutenant Colonel in the Infantry Branch in the U.S. Army Retired Reserves and resident of Moreno Valley, as his guest to the State of the Union."
Elton has dedicated his life to serving our country honorably and to supporting veterans in our community.
I was introduced to Elton when he contacted my district office for help getting a special immigrant visa for his translator in the Middle East.
He continued working closely with my staff to get seven other translators special immigrant visas of their own.
Elton is a Moreno Valley native.
"He served in the 4th Marine Division and later transferred to the U.S. Army, where he spent ten years in the U.S. Army Special Forces."
"In 1985, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Armor Branch."
"After the 9/11 attacks, he was called up for active military duty and served two tours of duty in Iraq, and one tour of duty in Afghanistan."
He is currently a Lieutenant Colonel in the Infantry Branch in the U.S. Army Retired Reserves and he is enrolled in American Military University where he is pursuing his Masters in Business Administration under the new G.I.
"Bill, and serves as the President and CEO of AmeriVet Securities, Inc. His military awards include the Bronze Star Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Combat Action Badge."

I hope you enjoyed the big game yesterday.
"It was an exciting game (and, as a Seahawks fan, I was happy to see the Niners lose)."
The Groundhog Day commercial... and the food!
"I ate far too many chips, far too much dip, and way too many chicken wings."
"Actually, it was a pretty fun game (and my daughters have convinced me to become a fan of The Masked Singer)."
"Tomorrow, Ill be heading back to DC, and the first order of business is the State of the Union address."
I was asked by someone after my town hall this Saturday what I hoped to hear from President Trump on Tuesday night.
There are a lot of differences between the residents priorities and mine.
"Having said that, most of the folks I represent want the President to work with Democrats and Republicans to solve some problems."
"In his address, I hope the President outlines some areas where he believes he can work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people."
"In fact, this morning, I joined a number of my colleagues in asking that President Trump address areas where the American people want folks in D.C. to find common ground and make progress, including:   Improving access to quality, affordable health care."
"Unfortunately, the Administration has taken steps that have increased premiums and increased the number of uninsured Americans."
There are opportunities to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and fix elements of our healthcare system that need fixing.
That should be a priority that both parties can get behind.
Following through on a commitment to rebuild Americas crumbling infrastructure.
Its hard for America to compete in a 21st Century economy with 19th Century infrastructure.
"There arent Democratic roads or Republican bridges, so this ought to be an area where the two parties and collaborate."
Prioritizing a future that works for all Americans.
"In the midst of disruptive economic change, its important to ensure that American workers are empowered to navigate those changes rather than be victimized by them."
"Investments in education and training, efforts to increase wages, and strengthening protections for workers can ensure that more people in more places have economic opportunity."
Restoring Americas role in the world.
Its time to reengage constructively with our allies and restore our role as a leader.
That can improve Americas security and economy.
Taking action to build long-lasting solutions to reduce carbon emissions.
The clean energy sector will be a core driver of economic growth and job creation.
"There are a number of common-sense, bipartisan proposals that would represent concrete action to curb carb emissions, spur economic growth and create jobs."
"I feel so strongly about the need to make progress on that last priority, Im bringing a special guest to the State of the Union: Kitsap County resident Mike Kelly."
"Mike, a small businessowner who lives with his family on Bainbridge Island, is the Congressional District Liaison in our region for Citizens Climate Lobby, a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on policies to combat climate change."
Ive been working actively to see the United States take action to step up to the climate crisis.
"Thankfully, Im not alone."
"In fact, folks across our region and across the country are stepping up to raise awareness about the need to act."
"Mike Kelly, local organizers, and the team at Citizens Climate Lobby are helping to lead the way."
Im proud to have Mike attend the State of the Union to continue the call for the President to listen to the American people who are not just demanding action - but leadership - to combat climate change and its impacts.
"We know that if we do this right, we can not only help our planet - we can create quality jobs and sustainable economic growth."
You can read all about what Mikes attendance means to him in the Kitsap Sun.
"There are plenty of policy differences between me and this Administration, but in an era of divided government, progress requires collaboration."
"I hope we hear that commitment to working together from him tomorrow, too."
"Now, on to the news Taking Action to Keep America Safe  In recent weeks, theres been a lot of discussion about rising tensions between the United States and Iran."
"As Ive traveled across our region, Ive heard from folks who are deeply concerned about this escalation - and I share those concerns."
"Ultimately, the American people do not want - and Congress has not authorized - another war in the Middle East."
"Our servicemembers and diplomats who serve there, including the ones I visited in Iraq this past November, deserve a strategy that keeps them safe, enhances our security, and fosters long term stability in the region."
"Last week, Congress passed two bills I co-sponsored to reclaim the Constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and authorize the use of military force, an authority that has eroded over the last two decades."
"You can hear more about that here:    Ensuring Future Generations Never Forget  Every year on Holocaust Memorial Day, we honor the millions of innocent people who lost their lives."
Families across the world have their own stories of this dark chapter in our worlds history.
"This year on Holocaust Memorial Day, which coincided this year with the 75th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the House passed the Never Again Education Act - bipartisan legislation I supported to strengthen Holocaust education efforts in America so future generations can continue to learn these stories."
"This bill will provide fundamental resources, education, and training for teachers and students across the country to ensure we continue to educate our communities and future generations on the lessons of the Holocaust - and ultimately promote the importance of preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people."
"Continuing the Fight Against the Opioid Epidemic  Across our country, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have been one of the leading causes of drug overdoses and fatalities."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 41% of the 70,200 drug overdoses in the United States in 2017 were caused by fentanyl and illicit chemical copycats of the drug, which is 100 times more potent than morphine."
"And in 2018, there were over 30,000 fentanyl-related overdose deaths alone."
"In response, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2018 placed a temporary emergency order to classify all fentanyl analogues as Schedule 1 drugs (meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use)."
"This temporary order increased restrictions in terms of access, manufacturing, and use - and has led to the supply of new fentanyl analogues dropping by 75 percent."
"Last week, the House took bipartisan action to extend the temporary order on these drugs for 15 more months, overwhelmingly passing the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act."
The bill will also require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report within 12 months on the public health and safety effects of controlling fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1.
"While its only a temporary solution, its a start."
"Im hopeful that Congress will continue to work to develop common-sense, long-term solutions to the opioid crisis."
Working for You  Honoring Our Veterans  Want to be inspired?!?
Listen to this story...
I recently held a Vietnam Veterans pinning ceremony in Tacoma to say thank you to Vietnam-era vets on behalf of a grateful nation.
"About halfway through the event, we got a call that a group of veterans was on its way from the Retsil Veterans Home in Kitsap County but that they would be an hour late."
"Having already pinned everyone in attendance, I made an announcement that more vets were on the way, and I asked if folks would be willing to stick around to thank the folks who were coming from Retsil."
I was so moved that every single person stuck around.
"One veteran said to me, You know, a lot of us have waited forty or fifty years to get thanked."
I can wait a few minutes to honor these folks coming from Retsil.
It was a real testament to the awesome character of our community - and of the veterans who have served our country.
Im grateful for everyone that came out for this special event.
"Celebrating Team Kitsap  The economic forecast for Kitsap County is bright thanks to the presence of the incredible employers, innovative educational partners, and the economic development A-Team that is the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance."

The USMCA delivers on the promise President Trump made to replace the outdated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
"This deal marks a tremendous victory for Pennsylvania workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses."
"It has the potential to create nearly 600,000 jobs and generate up to $235 billion in economic activity."
"In Pennsylvania, trade with Canada and Mexico is essential."
"Over 42,000 jobs depend upon manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico."
The USMCA will provide businesses across the Commonwealth with new opportunities and will create new jobs with family-sustaining wages.
"The signing of the USMCA into law means expanding and opening new market access for our Pennsylvania dairy, egg and poultry producers."
"New markets are welcome news for the nearly 7,000 family-owned and operated farms in PA-11."
"Our farmers in York and Lancaster Counties, who are national leaders in the production of milk and eggs, have only asked for a level playing field which to compete."
"This modern trade deal brings our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico into the 21st century, protecting American intellectual property and ensuring strong, effective protections for innovators and creators."
"I congratulate the President for delivering on his promise, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to implement policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our nation."

I strongly oppose this legislation.
"We must keep Americans safe.To read my full statement on this legislation, click here."
"York County District Attorneys Visits Washington  It was great to have York County District Attorney, Dave Sunday, in the office this week."
He was in town for the National District Attorney Association 2020 Capital Conference.
We discussed important criminal justice issues facing York County.I appreciate his offices efforts to keep our community safe and look forward to continuing our discussion.
"Honoring Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick  This week, Congress honored the life and service of Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick who lost his battle with cancer."
He was a fierce advocate for Pennsylvanias 8th district and he will be missed.
"Click to Watch     Heres Lloyd  Since Ive taken office, Ive held nearly 300 meetings with constituents and nearly 200 visits all across our districtincludingschools, non-profit organizations and small businesses."
"Keep up to date by following my on Facebook, Twitter and visitHeres Lloyd  a diary of all my visits across PA-11."

I'm also very proud of the help my office has been able to provide constituents.
"More than 4,400 individuals and families have been helped, and more than$4,964,699has been returned to constituents."
"If you need help with a federal agency, my office can help cut through Washington's red tape and bureaucracy."
"       \from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                          February 2, 2020     Dear Friend,  The news headlines last week were once again focused on the Senate trial, which thankfully appears to be heading toward closure."
"I look forward to moving past this partisan-fueled distraction in order to concentrate on issues that impact the every day lives of Americans, which has always been my primary concern."
"In fact, President Trump just signed a bill I authored which will help strengthen the public safety communication system."
This marks the 10th bill I have authored to be signed into law since January of 2019.
I will continue working across the aisle to get things done for the people I serve.
Please continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf last week.
Putting an End to Robocalls  This article highlights a recent crackdown on robocallers.
It is great to see that these bad actors facilitating robocalls are finally being held accountable.
I anticipate that we will see more of this type of aggressive action in the coming months as the new legislation we just passed to stop robocalls gets fully implemented.
"Supporting Economic Development  Last week, President Trump signed the USMCA into law."
"This improved trade deal protects American workers and will create almost 200,000 new jobs."
It is also exciting to see this project moving forward.
"It will be among the many things that continue to make Pasco a great place to live, work and play!"
Raising Awareness  Last week we had a Florida Delegation meeting to discuss human trafficking and further steps that we can take at the federal level to combat the problem.
"With the Super Bowl coming to Tampa next year, I was encouraged to learn more about the work currently being done in Miami to prevent the spike in human trafficking that typically accompanies these high profile events."
Visit the National Human Trafficking Prevention Hotline's website to learn more about resources available for victims.
Together we can help stop this terrible crime.
"Last week, we recognized International Holocaust Remembrance Day."
"We remember the millions of lives lost at the hands of the Nazi regime and the atrocities that can occur when intolerance, hatred and bigotry are accepted."
We must never allow this to happen again.
"On this 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, we mourn those who were tortured, abused or killed there, and we give thanks to the heroes who risked their lives to help liberate the camp."
"I am saddened that 75 years later we are still fighting a rise in anti-Semitic behavior, language and beliefs."
There is simply no place for this type of ignorance in our society.
"As co-chair of the International Religious Freedom Caucus, I am resolute in my commitment to support freedom of religion and expression around the globe."
"#WeRemember   Addressing Public Health Issues  Last week, I attended a bipartisan briefing on the Coronavirus."
"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) gave us a rundown of current efforts to contain the outbreak in China, as well as, the current attempts to develop a vaccine."
The most important message from the CDC is that we all need to remain calm.
The CDC is confident that it is taking necessary precautions to protect Americans.
"Dr. Robert Redfield from the CDC said, If you are experiencing respiratory issues, and have not been to China, it is incredibly unlikely that you have contracted the virus."
"However, if you have flu-like symptoms, it is a good idea to go see your healthcare provider."
In last week's Health Subcommittee hearing we also examined safety concerns associated with counterfeit medications and products sold through e-commerce businesses.
Click here to listen to my exchange with the panelists.
Advocating for our Heroes  During last week's VA Hearing we discussed the steps being taken to identify Veterans who may be in need of mental health services during their transition to civilian life.
Click here to listen to my exchange with VA officials.
We also have to change our approach for how we handle suicide prevention in the Veteran community.
"For too long, too many of our heroes have died."
I applaud the Senate for advancing critical legislation which requires a new strategy and urge my House colleagues to take up the measure when the bill comes over from the Senate.
"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received this email from a constituent in Palm Harbor."
"Representative Bilirakis,  On behalf of my wife and I we would like to thank you and your staff for a wonderful and memorable trip to our nations capital."
Kathy and I celebrated our 43rd wedding anniversary with a lifelong dream come true.
Your amazing staff made us feel so welcome and the young interns that led us on our tour of the capital could not have been any nicer and informative.
Words alone just wont do justice or how terrific we were treated.
The trip was everything we had hoped for and more.
The White House was beyond our wildest expectations.
It was so wonderful to see our nations history up close.
I am a Navy veteran and the pride in my country was so great to feel.
"How lucky we are to live in this great country, even with our warts there is nothing in mankinds history to rival our great nation."
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
"In addition to offering tours and helping to make constituents' trips to D.C. special, I have a team of caseworkers available to assist any constituent in need."
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team was proud to participate in the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce's Business Development Week Kick-Off Luncheon.
The stories shared were inspirational and it is always great to see so many professionals willing to learn from one another and help each other succeed.
My team enjoyed the opportunity to participate in last week's meeting of the Suncoast Chapter of Military Officers Association.
"In addition to providing a brief legislative update, we were able to answer questions about the new VA Clinic on Little Road."
My team enjoyed participating in the Grand Opening of Esthetics 813 in Wesley Chapel.
It is always good to see new businesses moving the area.
Welcome to the community!
"It was bittersweet for my team to participate in the Celebration of Life for Ms. Karen Collins, a long-time VA employee at James A. Haley Veterans Hospital."
Karen was a tireless and dedicated employee.
Her sudden passing left us all in shock.
"As a Public Affairs Officer, Karen was a critical point of contact for my team for many years."
She was a tremendous asset as we endeavored to help Veterans experiencing hardship.
She will be sorely missed.
My team also volunteered to help with the Homeless Point in Time Count in Pasco.
This one-day snap shot of the number of homeless persons in a community occurs throughout the country.
The number of persons counted on that day is used to determine how much federal and state funding each county will receive to combat homelessness.
We want to make sure each county has accurate results.
A special thank you to all the volunteers who participated throughout Tampa Bay to ensure that our community receives its share of the resources needed to help those in need.
Thank you for reading this weeks update.

THE CORONAVIRUS I met with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases this week about the coronavirus.
"Rep. Carter and members of the Energy and Commerce Committee meeting with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases about the coronavirus The agencies informed us that, at this time, the immediate risk to the American people from the coronavirus is low."
"While the risk is low, this is a rapidly changing situation and the CDC recommends taking some precautions including getting a flu shot and taking everyday preventative actions to stop the spread of germs."
"To find more information about the CDC's recommendations, visit the CDC's website by clicking here."
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS A BIG WIN FOR AMERICAN WORKERS President Trump signed the USMCA this week.
I was proud to support the trade agreement when it was before the U.S. House of Representatives.
"The USMCA is a big win for American workers, farmers and families."
"The agreement is expected to create 176,000 new jobs, spur $68 billion in economic growth, create a new chapter on digital trade and expand agricultural markets."
Click here for the latest episode of Buddy's Briefing I discussed this historic trade agreement in this edition of Buddy's Briefing.

FIGHTING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.
It is a schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act.
"However, drug traffickers have been able to make small changes to fentanyls chemical structure, creating new variations of the substance called analogues."
"Because of how quickly the traffickers are able to modify the substance, most of these analogues are not on the schedule of controlled drugs and are therefore outside of the control of law enforcement."
The creation of analogues has outpaced DEAs ability to schedule them.
"Fortunately, the Controlled Substances Act provides the Attorney General with the authority to temporarily place a substance in schedule I of the CSA for two years if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety."
"In 2018, the DEA used this authority to place fentanyl analogues and fentanyl like substances in Schedule I."
"This authority is only temporary, though, and the emergency scheduling order was set to expire next week."
We worked this week to bring an extension to the Floor and I'm very glad that it passed.
"In one year alone, synthetic opioids like fentanyl claimed more than 32,000 American lives and we must do everything we can to stop it."
"FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCLI January 27, 2020: On Saturday I attended the memorial scripture service for Darien City Manager Tim Sweezey, who died unexpectantly earlier this month."

"Thankfully, I was not a judge but I was a taster and it was all delicious."
"Later in the evening, I had the honor of being the keynote speaker at the Richmond Hill High School JROTC military ball held at the City Center in J F Gregory Park."
"Rep. Carter with students at the Richmond Hill High School JROTC military ball The Wildcat battalion, as they are known, is a group of the best and brightest students who participate in this program thats mission statement is to motivate young people to be better citizens."

"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                          February 2, 2020 Friday night, in a showing of true cowardice and abdication of duty, Republican Senators voted against subpoenaing key documents and witnesses in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump, effectively condoning the Presidents crimes andthe railroading of our Constitution."
"I believe, and the majority of America knows, thatthis President cant be legitimately acquitted because he never underwent a real trial."
"The sham trial began ominously when Senator Mitch McConnell, in the dead of night, pushedthrough a set of trial rules without guarantees for key witnesses or documents and despite the Trump Administrations blatant obstruction of Congress and the American people from hearing all the facts of the case."
"Nevertheless, the House managers presented a powerful case, proving to the American people that the President must be removed from office for Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress."
"As the Presidents defense team presented its arguments, a shocking development heightened the urgent need for witness testimony and documents to be turned over to Congress that thisAdministration refusedto provide."
"Friday night's vote by Republican Senators not to call witnesses and provide the public with a complete and unvarnished accounting of the President's scheme to bribe Ukraine with millions of dollars of badly needed military funding and equipment -- fundsalready approved byCongress -- inexchange for dirt on his politicalrival makes them complicit inthe President'sscheme.Without witnesses or evidence this is not a trial, it's a travesty."
"Republicans in the House and Senatewho have willingly gonealong withthe President'sdefense that anything he does, no matter how criminal or corrupt, is unimpeachable if he says it's in the public's interest has placedour entire system of government, the rule of law, and our Constitution in great peril."
"This is a moment in history that revealedthose whohad the courage and conviction to uphold their duty, and those who cared more about advancing the power of their party and hanging onto their seats."
"Despite this historic low point, the Democratically controlled House continued with criticallegislative business to benefit hardworking Americans and their families.I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to make it easier for military survivors to report sexual assaults."
I also led a letter with 49 of my Democratic Women's Caucus colleagues to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women.
"Though the examples are numerous, the letter was promptedin light of his most recent comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing ""a good job"" on a reporter that Pompeoverbally attacked simplybecause she did her job."
"Read below for more details of the week, and make sure to check your inbox for the next edition of Jackie's DC Dashboard."

"Legislative Highlights Impeachment Update: Bolton Bombshell Drops as Senate Heads Toward Critical Vote on Witnesses and Documents It was reported earlier this week that John Bolton, the Presidents former National Security Advisor, wrote in the manuscript for his book that the President told him directly that he was withholding security aid from Ukraine so that he could extract announcements of investigations into his Democratic political rivals."
"On Friday, The New York Times reported that Bolton's manuscript contains details of the President directing Bolton to help with the President's pressure campaignonUkraine, which dangled the promise of a White House meeting and critically neededfunding for the fledgling democracyin exchange for a hit jobon Trumps political rival."
"The article states,Mr."
"Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the presidents personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the presidents impeachment defense."
"That gun isnt just smoking, the barrel isred hot and the trigger is covered with the President's grubby fingerprints."
The Senate trial heads into its finalconclusionnext week followingSenate Republicans voteFriday night against calling fact witnesses or requiring a shred of documentary evidence to be presented.
Rest assured thatmy Democratic colleagues in the House and I will continue to fight the President's and Republicans' attempts to consolidate power in the Executive Branch and their cover-upof his crimesand corruption.
America needs and demands the truth; we will not rest until all the facts are unearthed for the public's view and benefit.
"Introduced Legislation to Make it Safe for Military Survivors to Report Assault On Thursday, I introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague, Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE), to make it easier for sexual assault survivors across the military to report their assailants."
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) expect to introduce companion legislation in the United States soon.
Too many sexual assault survivors in our military and academies hesitate to report attacks because they fear they be punished for minor infractionssuch as underage drinking or curfew violationsthat may be uncovered during the assault investigation.
"Getting survivors to report these incidents so that they can access services and perpetrators can be held accountable is should be the focus of military leadership, not punishment of victims for minor misconduct."
"Our bill will ensure survivors cannot be punished for minor issues when they report an assault, unless aggravating circumstances exist."
The Air Force Academy has already tested this program and seen positive results.
"Survivors and their loved ones should know that will fight hard to pass this legislation in this years National Defense Authorization Act, and that they are not alone."
Sent Letter to the President Condemning his Continuing Degradation of Women a letter to President Trump condemning his disrespectful rhetoric and policies toward women.
"The letter was sent on the heels of Secretary Pompeo disparaging NPRs Mary Louise Kelly, a well-renowned journalist, for doing her job when she asked Pompeo about Ukraine."
"Kelly said that Pompeo shouted and swore at her and demanded she find the country on an unmarked map, which she did with no trouble."
Pompeo then barred the reporter from covering his upcoming trip to Europe.
"The next day, President Trump validated this misogynistic and autocratic behavior by stating, you did a good job on her."
"Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, an esteemed career diplomat committed to anti-corruption reforms who the President referred to as the woman who is going to go through some things in the infamous July 25 call with President Zelensky, was yet another casualty."
It is most shameful that the words young girls and boys hear directed at women from the upper echelons of power are dripping with disdain and disrespect.
"It is as if this President relishes the opportunity to publicly humiliate any woman who fights back, speaks up, or takes up space."
"As the women of the DWC admonished him in our letter, the President of the United States should set a moral example for our children, not be the biggest bully on the playground."
"Asked Defense Department About Remedial Action for Whistleblower Retaliation At a hearing this week of the Government Operations Subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee, we heard from a panel of government officials and experts on the need for stronger whistleblower protections in our laws."
"As Co-Chair of the Houses Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I have long advocated for whistleblower protection laws and have secured crucial legislative victories advancing rights to intelligence and congressional whistleblowers."
"Much of the hearing focused on the huge backlog of 2,500 cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has been unable to function for over a year because President Trump and Senator McConnell have failed to fill seats on the board for quorum."
"I asked Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, why there possibly could be cases of illegal reprisals against whistleblowers that are substantiated during inspector general investigations and yet never result in compensation for the whistleblower."
"Fine agreed with me that there is a disturbing trend of defense agencies essentially ignoring inspector general recommendations to make whistleblowers whole, and that Congress must continue to put pressure and legislate to protect whistleblowers."
"Armed Services Committee Hearing on Security of the Korean Peninsula On Tuesday, I pressed representatives from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Intelligence Agency at the House Armed Services Committees hearing on the lack of a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea."
"The President gave Kim Jong-un multiple PR victories, praising him, meeting with him, and becoming the first U.S. President to set foot in North Korea, raising their global recognition and validating a regime never before recognized by Democratic or Republican Administrations."
None of these displays got us any closer to containing the North Korean threat.
"Now, the Administration claims its applying a maximum pressure campaign."
"However, its also pressuring and disrespecting our allies in South Korea and Japan, demanding outrageous increases to the billions of dollars our allies already contribute annually to our mutual defense."
The Presidents handling of the security region is erratic and dangerous.
We must continue to demand a coherent strategy for dealing with our adversaries and hold this Administrations feet to the fire for the safety and security of the region and our country.
"Oversight Committee Hearing on 75 Years After the Holocaust: The Ongoing Battle Against Hate Tuesday, I attended the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Additional hearings will be held in the coming weeks on voter suppression in minority communities, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim discrimination, anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions, and challenges facing LGBTQ individuals."
"As Chair of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Military Personnel, Ill also preside at a hearing next month on the dangers of white supremacist elements in our military."
"Discussion on Poverty in the 21st Century and its Impact on Women As Co-Chair of the Democratic Womens Caucus, I participated in a discussion on modern day poverty and its disproportionate impact on women."
We heard from experts who explained the shocking reality that more people die of poverty in America than heart attacks and cancer combined.
"For millions of Americans, every day is a struggle to avoid eviction, put food on the table, or pay for just one doctors visit."
"Beyond these challenges, many women also take on the dual responsibilities of a traditional job and home and child care."
"This social production work constitutes a second job, but its not adequately valued in our society."
"In a particularly heart-breaking moment, I listened as one mother recounted her daughters struggle with cancer."
"Like many Americans struggling with inadequate health care, her daughter went to an emergency room after discovering a lump in her breast and was turned away without any additional care or tests due to her lack of health insurance."
"After months of no medical care, severe pains forced her back to the ER."
The untreated cancer had spread through her entire body and caused her breast to completely rot off.
"As the wealthiest country in the world, it is a choice  not a forced reality  to not invest in affordable health care for every American."
"Indeed, the mothers home state of Alabama opted out of the Medicaid expansion."
No mother should have to watch her daughter die before her eyes knowing it was avoidable.
"Doubling rates of homelessness, hospital closures to make way for real estate development, and a complete lack of affordable dental care rounded out the discussion and further underscored the inhumane inequality growing in our country."
We must remember that our nations successes cannot be fairly measured without considering everyone that has been left behind.
Meeting with Jackie Met with Representatives from CalPERS  I am proud of all of Californias public employees and pleased that their retirement is in the hands of the trustworthy and forward-thinking managers at CalPERS.
Voices of Californias 14th District  Here are some issues they raised this week:  96 constituents expressed their concern for the climate crisis.
"We must take bold action to combat climate change, end our addiction to fossil fuels, and grow our green economy."
How we address climate change now will be the defining moment of this century.
You have my word that I will be a vigorous advocate for bold action to solve this crisis so that we can leave a healthier planet for future generations.
60 constituents shared their support for our public lands.
"For years, Republicans in Congress have waged a war against our public lands, introducing dangerous bills that threaten public land ownership and benefit special interest groups and corporate polluters at the expense of our environment."
"I have consistently voted against legislation that would allow state governments to sell or exploit public lands for profit and I have fought efforts to scale back protections under the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other critical environmental safeguards."
22 constituents expressed their support for increased consumer safety regulations.
"As an avid proponent of consumer protection, I recognize the importance of improved labeling and consumer education campaigns and have introduced legislation to combat risks ranging from lead-filled childrens glasses to poisonous detergent pods."

"5065, the Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated Act, a bill I co-led and introduced with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries."
This billwould provide small business counseling and training services to non-violent offenders.
"Some individuals who have paid their debt to society deserve a second chance at success, and this will prepare them to re-enter society and contribute to the workforce."
"The Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated Act follows another bill I co-led, the Patriotic Employer Protection Act, which passed the House in November, and later became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act that the President signed into law in December."
"This legislation strengthens programs that enable employers to hire military reservists, and both bills speak to the effectiveness of bipartisan efforts that have the power to improve lives and strengthen our communities."
"Im committed to local investment and growth, which is why I co-sponsored H. Res."
"815, Supporting Minor League Baseball."
"As you may have heard, Major League Baseball recently decided to eliminate 42 minor league clubs across the nation."
This decision would affect six of Tennessees minor league teams.
"Were fortunate to have the Tennessee Smokies nearby, and it would be a shame for towns from the East to West Coast to lose the local investment that minor league baseball provides."
"At the end of last month, I was proud to introduce H.R."
"5634, which would amend the Social Security Act so folks who are owed past-due Social Security benefits are paid first instead of their legal representatives."
"Since taking office, many of you have contacted me about your frustration with late Social Security payments, and I hope that this measure will enable those who have contacted me, as well as all Americans across the country who have worked their entire lives for Social Security benefits, to receive them in a timely manner."
"As January closed, I joined my colleagues in remembering the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp by paying tribute to the survivors and victims of the Holocaust."
"I was honored to attend a Europe, Eurasia, Energy and the Environment Subcommittee meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee where I heard Dr. Deborah E. Lipstadt, professor of Jewish history and Holocaust studies at Emory University, speak."
"My dad fought the Nazis in World War II, and I am extremely concerned at the recent rise in anti-Semitism."

"     News from Representative Steve Womack          HOME  ABOUT STEVE  SERVICES  3RD DISTRICT  ISSUES  LEGISLATION  NEWSROOM       January 31, 2020    WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this weeks From the Front I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nations capital, including Daren and Laura McMillen of Prairie Grove and Danny and Carmen Aldridge of Fort Smith."
Safe travels back to the Natural State!

"It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!"
"This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month."
David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead.
"They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation."
Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .
Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico  two of Arkansass top trading partners.
"The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity."
"For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs."
"The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this weeks signing delivers a 21stcentury trade framework."
"This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural States world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansass hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families."
"Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansass exports."
"Afrom the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million."
"Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand."
Its exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December.
"By negotiating from strength  the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy."
This landmark agreement puts America first!
I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line.
"Promises made, promises kept!"
The President also announced his .
"The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people."
"With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East."
No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone  and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation.
"On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future."
Centuries of hostilities wont be solved overnight  but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path.
"I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region."
Its noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda.
"While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America."
"The results speak for themselves  thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created."
"In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations."
"We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt."
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory.
"Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year."
"On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic."
It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion.
"Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030."
Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window.
"Our countrys unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt."
"Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030."
"To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget."
"Weve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously."
"Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt."
The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.
"It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them."
Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions  which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country.
"Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesnt appear that well have one this year either."
"In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year."
"Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, were not doing a budget."
It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face.
We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people.
"Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State!"
"I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies."
"I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith  who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association  to discuss the Community Development Block Grant programand other initiatives that support housing and community development."
The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators.
"It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the Universitys priorities."
I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas.
"I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas."
"They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development."
"I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell  and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District."
"My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare."
I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year.
The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief.
"While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House."
"The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence."
"Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient."
"Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith."
The funding  awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA)  will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD).
These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.
Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District.
"This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation."
"By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities."
Wishing you a great weekend!

"Newsletter # This Week in the Office of Senator Marco Rubio On Friday, I released a statement on the ongoing impeachment trial explaining why I will not vote to remove the President -- because doing so would inflict extraordinary and potentially irreparable damage to our already divided nation."
Read my full statement [here](and watch my video message [here]([!
"[](On Friday, I joined Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and other Senate colleagues in sending a letter to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concerning Taiwans exclusion from the World Health Organization and urging the WHO to grant Taiwan observer status."
"On Thursday, the WHO declared the Wuhan coronavirus a global health emergency but has not permitted Taiwan to attend any emergency briefings despite Taiwan having confirmed cases of the coronavirus."
"[](On Wednesday, Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) and I urged President Trump to include $250 million for Everglades Restoration efforts in his forthcoming Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 budget to Congress."
This amount builds off their successful effort to secure $200 million in federal funds for FY 2020 South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER).
"[](On Wednesday, I issued a statement after the Trump Administration announced it will extend sanctions waivers on Iran's civil nuclear program."
"[](On Wednesday, I wrote in the *Washington Examiner* about the need for the United States to do more to support our ally, Taiwan, after the Taiwanese people rejected Beijings authoritarianism and reelected President Tsai Ing-wen to office with historic levels of support."
"[](On Monday, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and I applauded the House passage of our bipartisan Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which will assist veterans re-entering the workforce by directing the National Science Foundation to encourage veterans to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)."
The bill now goes to President Trumps desk to be signed into law.
"[](On Monday, Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and I applauded the passage of the House counterpart to our bipartisan *Never Again Education Act*, which would establish dedicated federal funding to provide teachers with the resources and training necessary to teach our students the important lessons of the Holocaust."

"                  ABOUT  SERVICES  LEGISLATION               January 31, 2020    Connect with us                   Dear Lindsey,  Building a Clean, Energy-Efficient Economy  On Monday, I held a roundtable discussion with environmental and energy policy experts and unveiled my Clean Energy Agenda, which consists of legislation Ive led and am supporting to address climate change and transition to a clean energy economy."
"Simply put, we cannot fight climate change without building a clean, energy-efficient economy."
The legislation in my agenda aims to secure Americas path toward a sustainable future.
"Additionally, many of these bills have bipartisan support and demonstrate specific actions that Congress can take right away to reduce carbon pollution."
"I look forward to my continued work to improve public health, strengthen our economy with green jobs, and protect the natural beauty we are so lucky to have in the Granite State."
This week I also sat down with the Concord Chamber to discuss my Clean Energy Agenda and explore bipartisan solutions that can decarbonize our economy.
"From winter sports to maple harvesting, I look forward to my continued work to transition our state to a clean energy economy to protect all that makes the Granite State such a special place to call home."
Empowering New Hampshire Businesses  This week I was glad to join community leaders at the New England Council (NEC) to give an update on my work in Congress and discuss how we can work together to grow New Hampshires economy and help our local businesses thrive.
The NEC is a wonderful advocate for Granite State families and businesses  I look forward to our continued work together to ensure our state has the tools it needs to succeed and get ahead.
Working with community leaders to help the Granite State thrive.
Bipartisan Action to Prevent Fentanyl Overdoses  I led Wednesdays House passage of the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act.
Fentanyl is killing people in New Hampshire and across the country.
Communities throughout our state have been devastated by the opioid epidemic and we know that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are central to fueling this deadly crisis.
We must use every tool available to reduce fatal fentanyl overdoses.
"On Wednesday, Congress took bipartisan action and averted disaster by ensuring that fentanyl remains a schedule 1 narcotic and members of our law enforcement community dont have the rug pulled out from under them."
I will continue to work across the aisle to ensure that we combat the opioid and substance abuse crisis from every angle.
Speaking on the House Floor about the legislation.
"USMCA Agreement Signed into Law  On Wednesday, President Trump signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law."
"I voted in favor of the trade agreement last month, and I was glad to see Congress and the White House work together in a bipartisan way to get it over the finish line."
"Many Granite State businesses export goods and services to Canada and Mexico, and cross-border trade with our neighbors is crucial to the health and vitality of New Hampshires economy."
"The agreement signed on Wednesday includes provisions to enforce Mexicos labor reforms and safeguard American jobs, more robust rules, and accountability mechanisms to protect our natural resources and improve access to Canadian markets for our dairy farmers."
"In addition, House Democrats successfully blocked language in USMCA that would have raised prescription drug costs for Americans, and secured key enforcement provisions to protect American jobs and improve accountability with Mexican labor laws."
"The agreement that the President provided Congress had insufficient enforcement mechanisms in these key areas, and I was proud to work with my colleagues to fix these problematic aspects of USMCA."
"While Im encouraged that the agreement includes improved environmental protections, there is more we can and must do to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution."
"I look forward to my continued work to protect our environment, address climate change, and help the Granite State economy thrive."
"Honoring Christa McAuliffe  Tuesday marked the 34th anniversary of the Challenger disaster that took the life of Concord High School teacher Christa McAuliffe, along with the lives of fellow crew members Dick Scobee, Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Mike Smith and Ellison Onizuka."
Everyone in New Hampshire remembers where they were on the day of the Challenger disaster.
Our nation and the students who were privileged to have Christa McAuliffe as their teacher were heartbroken.
Christa reached for the stars and inspired her students to do the same.
I was honored to join my colleagues to help pass legislation just last year to create a commemorative coin to keep Christas pioneering spirit alive as she continues to spark a passion for science and exploration among younger generations.
"Christa McAuliffe    My Guest at the State of the Union Next Week  Im proud that Ross Cunningham, Superintendent of the Merrimack County Department of Corrections, will join me in Washington as my guest for the State of the Union Address next week."
I deeply respect Mr. Cunninghams extensive experience in our justice system and I am grateful for his dedication to ensuring vulnerable Granite Staters with substance use disorder can access the treatment they need.
"While weve made progress in our fight to combat the opioid epidemic in New Hampshire and across the country, we have more work to do."
"Prevention, treatment and recovery go hand in hand with law enforcement in addressing substance misuse  we must end the cycle of addiction and incarceration."
Im glad to host Mr. Cunningham to signal our shared commitment to curbing substance use disorder and supporting those who struggle with addiction.
"Here for You  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies."
"I was contacted by Patricia, a constituent from Littleton, who had an issue of concern regarding the Social Security Administration (SSA)."
My staff worked with SSA and helped resolve Patricias issue.
"If my office may be of assistance with a problem you are experiencing, please reach out to my staff at 603-226-1002 so we can learn how we may help."
Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live.

"USMCA Signed Into Law  Although impeachment dominated the mainstream media this week, important legislation was signed by President Trump."
"On Wednesday, President Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law."
"Our businesses (both small and large), workers, and economy will all benefit from this trade deal."
"Estimates say it will add $68 billion to our economy and create over 170,000 new American jobs."
"In Ohio alone, over 100,000 jobs depend on exports to Mexico and Canada."
"Make no mistake, this is big; this trade agreement will have tremendous benefits for those I represent."
"Just like Phase One of the China trade deal, this is another economic promise that President Trump has made good on."
It was way past time for the outdated NAFTA agreement to be put in the shredder and to stand up for the American worker...the USMCA does that.
Visit to Pennex Aluminum Plant   One of my stops earlier today was in Leetonia at Pennex Aluminum.
"The company is an industry leader in the casting, extruding, and fabricating of aluminum products."
"While there, I visited and met with employees, toured the plant and learned about their recent 100,000 sq."
ft. expansion in Columbiana County.
Its encouraging to see all of the local growth in the manufacturing industries.
"Afterwards, I headed down to Jefferson County for some more meetings and stops at small businesses."
"NO to Proposed Jefferson County Landfill Like many of you in Jefferson County, Ive been following the developments surrounding the old Crossridge Landfill."
"Ive also heard from many of you directly regarding the situation, and I appreciate hearing your views on this important issue."
"Citizens are organizing against it, and know thisI stand with YOU for the future of Jefferson County."
"Ive spoken with many local officials about this landfill issue, and we are all in agreement."
"Jefferson County is making very positive progress on several fronts, and now is not the time to lose this positive momentum."
"I have already conveyed my concerns about the landfill to officials at the Ohio EPA, and I plan on meeting with the Director of the Ohio EPA about this soon - I will be voicing OUR opposition."
"The first landfill on the site, which closed in 2016, was a total environmental disaster."
We dont need or want another dump site where other states can dump their garbage; they should find a way to handle their garbage in their own back yard.
"Navigable Waters Protection Rule Announcement For years, businesses, farmers, energy developers, and landowners have asked the federal government to give them certainty and clarity when it comes to how federal clean water regulations affect the permitting process."
The new Navigable Waters Protection Rule announced on January 24 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will provide exactly that - better certainty and clarity for the permitting process while protecting our water in Ohio and across the country.
The Obama-era Waters of the United States rule - a serious case of regulatory overreach where Washington bureaucrats took over local decision making - is now gone.
"Again and again, I spoke up against this burdensome, intrusive rule imposed by the Obama Administrations EPA."
"Right after I sent out last weeks eNewsletter, I discussed this new rule at an EPA and Army Corps of Engineers roundtable in Columbus."
"We talked about how this new rule right sizes the role of the federal government, and does not overstep its boundaries nor encroach on states rights."
"For instance, the Ohio EPA already does a great job, because they live and work here in Ohio where they depend on the cleanliness of our water resources; they want their families and neighbors to have clean water, and they know the area better than someone sitting behind a desk in Washington."
I look forward to working with the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to successfully implement this new rule in the days and years to come.

"Senator Rick Scott said, Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, Im glad to see the Department is putting national security first and adopting a no-fly rule for drones made in Communist China."
The Trump administration sees the risks associated with using taxpayer dollars to purchase tech from a Communist government that is trying to spy on us.
This is great news for our security.
"Now, we must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants."
We must take the threat from Communist China seriously.Read more HERE.

"Senator Rick Scott said, This week, I raised questions about the $12.5 million Foley  Lardner received to represent the illegitimate Maduro regime and announced that I would no longer meet with anyone from that firm."
Im glad they made the right decision to drop the Maduro regime as a client and return the money.
Its unfortunate they made the decision to give this murderous dictator legitimacy in the first place.
I would recommend to Foley  Lardner that they get involved in support of the people of Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro is perpetrating a genocide on the people of Venezuela.
Ive been to the border between Venezuela and Colombia.
I met young mothers who trek hours through the jungle just to get their only meal of the day.
I met children who travel through FARC-controlled territory to Colombia to go to school  the only way they can get an education.
"Thousands have died, millions have fled, and Maduro and his cronies have gotten fat and rich."

Me alegra que hayan tomado la decisin correcta de abandonar al rgimen de Maduro como cliente y devolver el dinero.
Es lamentable que hayan tomado la decisin de dar legitimidad a este asesino dictador en primer lugar.
Le recomendara a Foley  Lardner que se unan en apoyo al pueblo de Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro est perpetrando un genocidio contra la gente de Venezuela.
He estado en la frontera entre Venezuela y Colombia.

"Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration For Heeding His Call to Declare Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trumps decision to declare the 2019 Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States, and announcement that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended entry into the United States."
This decision follows Senator Scotts call last week for the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.
"Last Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agencys plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Last week, I called on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States, and I am glad they heeded that call today."
"Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy."
"We still need to take additional steps to protect Americans, including increased screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China."
China needs to do more to keep the world community accurately informed about the spread of the virus and follow Americas lead to ground Chinese commercial flights.
"Sen. Rick Scott Warns UK: Allowing Communist China in Your Networks is a Mistake  Ahead of the United Kingdoms decision to allow Huawei, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China, to build part of its 5G infrastructure, Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner warning the U.K. about the extreme risks associated with this decision."
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, Johnson and other U.K. leaders must be extremely careful when it comes to the threat of communist China and the implications for the United States relationship with the U.K."
"Put simply, the U.K. allowing Huawei to gain a foothold would be a grave mistake."
Huawei is a bad actor across the globe.
"Its a company that aids the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights, steal our data, technology, and intellectual property, and build up their military to compete with us and other freedom-loving countries."
Countries that do business with Huawei eliminate their citizens and their countrys privacy rights.
Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party are one and the same.
"If the U.S. is going to consider a trade agreement with the U.K., it is imperative that Huawei is recognized as a threat to our national security partnership."
The U.S. must put any trade deal with the U.K. on hold until Johnson commits to take swift action to ensure Huawei will not be used in their transition to 5G networks.
This is for the security of both the U.S. and the U.K.  Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.
Sen. Rick Scott: Peace Corps Needs to Stop Wasting Taxpayer Dollars and Get Out of Communist China Immediately  Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent op-ed on the Peace Corps decision to end its programs in Communist China.
Senator Rick Scott also sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China.
"In the letter to the editor, Senator Rick Scott wrote, Ive met with the Peace Corps director multiple times and asked her what the volunteers did in Communist China and why they were there."
"When I asked what the return on investment was for the U.S. taxpayers, the director (shockingly) had no answer."
The Peace Corps finally came to its senses this month and said it is leaving Communist China.
"Since then, the director has refused to meet with me."
"I would love to hear its plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China, but Im not holding my breath."

"Remembering the Holocaust   This week on Holocaust Remembrance Day, I was proud to support the passage of H.R."
"943, the Never Again Education Act, a bill I cosponsored earlier last year."
"Shockingly, a 2018 study reported that 22 percent of American millennials have never heard of the Holocaust or are unsure of what it is."
"Even more troubling, 66 percent of millennials could not identify Auschwitz as a concentration camp."
The passage of this legislation will ensure future generations remember the horrors of the Holocaust by providing educators resources to teach the events of the Holocaust.
"A society that fails to learn from the past is doomed to repeat it, and it is more important now than ever to impart on younger generations the consequences of hate and intolerance."
Constituent Corner   I am proud of the work my office does every day to help folks throughout the First Coast.
"Recently, we were able to help Callie, an American, reunite with her Swedish husband, Tomas (both pictured above), who was struggling to get timely approval for his immigrant visa from Sweden."

"I was proud to co-lead this legislation with Rep. Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), and managed its passage on the Floor on Monday."
"The bill would amplify the work of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, leveraging a combination of public and private funds to develop and disseminate high-quality Holocaust education resources, which can be adopted by local schools and included in their curriculum."
"The bill has the support of more than 1,800 Holocaust survivors from 38 states, as well as 350 organizations from across the country."
"On Monday, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the House reaffirmed its commitment to remembrance by passing this bill to ensure the next generation of students understand the dangers of rising anti-Semitism and recognize that it must never be forgotten."
"As we continue to condemn horrific acts of anti-Semitism across the world, we must also take proactive measures to educate and provide states and schools with the resources necessary to incorporate Holocaust education into their classrooms, ensuring that all students understand the evils of Holocaust and its impact."
"I am honored to co-lead this important legislation, and I applaud my colleagues in the House for its bipartisan passage.Watch my opening remarks on the House Floor in support of this legislationhere and above, and my closing remarkshere."
"Statement on President Trump Signing USMCA Into Law    This week, I proudly attended the signing of the USMCA trade agreement into law by President Trump."
"This is a significant victory for the North Country, and I am thrilled that the USMCA has been signed into law."
"This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy."
It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets.
"I have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers, and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these."
"Advocating for Rural Broadband for the North Country  Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a draft proposal for their new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which rendered all of New York ineligible for the $16 billion allocated in Phase I of the plan to expand high-speed broadband access."
"I called the Chairman of the FCC directly and sent a bipartisan letter with the New York delegation asking them to reverse this decision, and to reiterate the need for underserved areas in the North Country to be included in the funding."
"This week, FCC Chairman Pai sent a letter back to me stating that the proposal will be revised and areas of New York will be considered for Phase I eligibility under the general criteria."
Expanding access to high-speed broadband is critical to the economic well-being of our region.
"The FCC reversing their decision to categorically exclude New York is an important step in the right direction, as this will open the door to much needed investment in the areas of North Country that still lack broadband connectivity."
"However, the FCCs treatment of areas without high-speed access despite some state investment will be central to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund fulfilling its goal of truly closing the digital divide."
I will to continue to work closely with the FCC throughout the development of this important initiative to expand rural broadband access in the North Country.
"Testifying Before Ways  Means Committee on Bipartisan Paid Leave Proposal    This week, I testified before the House Ways  Means Committee in support of H.R."
"5296, the Advancing Support for Working Families Act, legislation I am leading with Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX)."
"This legislation will help working families cover the cost of parental leave, infant care, and other expenses that occur with birth or adoption of a new child by advancing up to $5,000 of their Child Tax Credit."
It is the only bipartisan and bicameral plan to help new parents access upfront financial assistance  and does it without raising taxes or creating new federal mandates.
Developing solutions to help new parents and working families thrive in this modern workforce is necessary for the continued economic success of our nation and the well-being of the next generation of Americans.
I will always advocate on behalf of hardworking North Country families to bring them tangible benefits and enhanced paid leave options as I continue to lead this effort through the House.
Watch my full testimony here and above.
"Cosponsoring Bill Protecting Voter Registration Systems Against Foreign Hacking  This week, I became an original cosponsor of the Protect American Voters Act, legislation to provide states with more adequate resources to secure their current and future election systems."
"This bill updates the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by directing the Election Assistance Commission to issue guidelines for non-voting election equipment, including electronic pollbooks, election night reporting systems, online voter registration systems, and other equipment."
It also establishes the first-ever Election Cyber Assistance Unit to connect local and state election officials with leading election administration and cybersecurity experts from across the country.
"Securing our elections includes prioritizing the protection of voters personal information, which has been at risk to foreign hacking for too long."
"I am proud to cosponsor this bill to ensure election equipment is utilized in a way that protects voter information, and that states are provided with resources and guidance to secure their individual election systems."
"I am a staunch advocate for measures to protect American elections from any foreign interference, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this effort."
"Announcing USDA Primary Agriculture Disaster Designation for the North Country  This week, I announced a USDA Primary Agricultural Disaster designation for all twelve counties in New Yorks 21st Congressional District."
This designation comes after excessive rain and weather events caused massive losses during the 2019 crop year.
"This designation makes farm operators eligible to be considered for certain assistance from the Farm Service Agency (FSA), including emergency loans."
"Farmers in these counties have 8 months from the date of this declaration to apply for emergency loans, and they are encouraged to act as soon as possible.The weather events this past spring, including excessive flooding in many areas, took a toll on farmers across upstate New York."
"I am glad USDA has made this designation and will be offering aid to producers, who are vital to the North Country."
I encourage any farmers who have questions about this application process to reach out to my offices directly.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:     ___________________  Featured Read:  Press Republican -Officials praise signing of USMCA  President Donald Trump's signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law drew praise from organizations and North Country officials."
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Schuylerville) lauded ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement's (NAFTA) replacement as a significant victory for the region.
"""This agreement will expand our markets for American-made goods with two vital trading partners, boosting our North Country economy,"" she said in a statement."
"""It also provides stability for our agriculture industry by increasing access to those markets."
"I am proud to have been an outspoken supporter of this important agreement from the beginning, and I will continue to work on behalf of North Country farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and hardworking families to deliver crucial results like these."""
North Country Chamber of Commerce President Garry Douglas said nothing is more important to the area's economy than its cross-border economic partnership with Canada.
"""With the enactment of the enabling legislation for USMCA, we can expect the continued benefits that will flow from a renewed and predictable economic relationship,"" he said in a statement."
"""The North Country, more than any other area of the U.S., has made itself a uniquely supportive environment for Canadian-based manufacturing in the U.S. market and for cross-border supply chains."""
"Douglas said the North Country's transportation equipment and aerospace cluster is a prime example, with 50 companies employing more than 9,000 people."
New York Farm Bureau President David Fisher said nearly half of the state's agricultural exports go to the country's North American neighbors.
"""Thanks to the presidents signature on USMCA, goods will continue to cross borders to benefit our states farms and rural economy,"" he continued."
"""The agreement provides certainty to farmers as well as opens the door to additional market opportunities, most notably for our dairy farms."""
Douglas and Fisher thanked Stefanik for her support of the agreement's passage.
"""Congresswoman Stefanik has been in the forefront of passage of the USMCA that is essential to balance and strengthen the capability of North Americas competitiveness and enhancing U.S.-Canada economic vitality,"" Canadian/American Border Trade Alliance President/CEO Jim Phillips said."
"Trump, former Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the USMCA on Nov. 30, 2018."
"The Mexican Senate ratified the agreement in June, and in December voted overwhelmingly to accept changes made as a result of negotiations between House Democrats and the White House."

"The trial began with three days of the House Impeachment Managers making their case for removal, followed by three days of the Presidents attorneys defending him."
Senators then submitted written questions which the Chief Justice read aloud and the House Managers and the Presidents attorneys responded to.
"On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives continued advancing its agenda for the people by introducing and passing bills, holding hearings, and oversight of the Executive Branch."

"Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week   CDC Briefing on Coronavirus I met with Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response; and Rear Admiral Denise Hinton with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."
"The coronavirus is a respiratory illness caused by a virus first identified in Wuhan, China."
"Most of the known cases and all deaths associated with the disease have been in China, with only seven confirmed cases in the U.S. to date."
"According to the CDC, the risk to the American public is low, unless someone has recently traveled to Wuhan and is experiencing respiratory symptoms."
"For the latest information about the coronavirus, visit the CDCs website."
"To prevent transmission of diseases, two simple but powerful acts of prevention are recommended."
"Wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly, and cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and everyone should get a flu shot."
"Questioned the CEO of PGE at House Energy and Commerce Hearing on Wildfires  The two most destructive fires in Californian history, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed over 18,000 buildings, were linked to PGEs equipment."
"On January 29th I grilled the CEO of PGE, Bill Johnson, about the utilitys widespread intentional blackouts at a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Environment  Climate Change on the impact of wildfires on the power sector and the environment."
You can watch my questions from the hearing HERE.
Addressing the scourge of wildfires in California continues to be a top priority for me.
"Last October, I introduced the Smoke Planning and Research Act to provide federal funding to help communities research, develop, and implement plans to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke."
Im also pushing hard to strengthen infrastructure to withstand wildfires.
"In July, 2019, I introduced the WIRED Act to allow states to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that will be resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters."
"Currently, states lack this authority and the consequences have been dire."
"Health Subcommittee Hearing on Food and Drug Safety  As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine ten mostly bipartisan bills to improve the safety and transparency in our food and drugs."
Twenty cents out of every dollar spent by American consumers goes toward food or medicine regulated by the FDA.
We examined the FDAs immense mission with two panels of expert witnesses.
Our first panel considered four bills to grant the FDA new authorities to tackle challenges that threaten our drug supply.
"Taken together, these bills improve the drug supply chain from the very beginning to the very end so that patients have access to quality products that are genuine, affordable, and accurately labeled."
The second panel considered six bills that affect the FDAs oversight of food products.
Many of these bills act on decisions that the FDA has long delayed.
"For example, we heard about one bill, the FASTER Act, which would require food manufacturers to list sesame as an allergen on their products."
It would also fund into federal studies to better understand the growing prevalence of food allergies in the United States.

"Voted YES on the No War Against Iran Act  President Trumps assassination of General Soleimani has placed U.S. service members, diplomats, embassies, and allied interests around the world at high risk, and has brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war."
"To add insult to injury, the President failed to properly consult Congress or seek the legal authority to take military action against Iran."
"The Administration has also failed to fully explain what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the U.S. that required the strike."
"No Member of Congress carries a brief for General Soleimani or the Iranian government, but no President has the unilateral authority to take our nation to war without authorization from Congress."
The No War Against Iran Act underscores that Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Iran.
It also prohibits federal funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.
"Ive long had concerns about the Trump Administrations provocative behavior toward Iran, beginning with the President tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, and its why I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act last April."
My bill restricts this Administration and any future administrations from using any funds appropriated by Congress to take military action in and against Iran without authorization from Congress.
House Infrastructure Package  This week the Majority released our framework for a five-year $760 billion infrastructure bill.
"The framework addresses our nations crumbling infrastructure by investing in zero-emission vehicles, expands access to broadband, upgrades clean water infrastructure, and creates an estimated 10 million new jobs."
"The package also authorizes $12 billion to modernize our countrys 9-1-1 systems, based on my legislation the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act."
You can read more about the infrastructure plan HERE.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Workforce Mobility Act  I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help workers by prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements."
This occurs when an employer restricts an employees future prospects through their employment contracts.
"While California has long prohibited non-competes, 40 percent of Americans have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point in their career."
"Reps. Scott Peters, Mike Gallagher, and I introduced the Workforce Mobility Act to ban non-compete agreements with a few narrow exceptions (such as the sale of a business)."
"Much of Silicon Valley was built by former employees of one tech company leaving to found another, all allowed because of Californias ban on non-compete agreements."
This ban continues to allow the Valley to prosper as an innovation powerhouse.
"Im proud that my legislation will make this a nationwide policy, ensuring all Americans have the ability to innovate."
"The Protecting Community Television Act  Community television is a critical part of our society, giving a voice to nonprofits, artists, schools, local governments, and other community members who otherwise struggle to be heard."
I introduced legislation to ensure that community television operations continue to receive the resources they need to educate and inform viewers in the cities and towns where they operate.
"Today, local governments are permitted to require that cable companies meet community needs by providing in-kind contributions that benefit public, educational, and government (PEG) channels, also known as community television stations."
Unfortunately the FCC proposed regulatory changes that would effectively end the in-kind contributions that support PEG stations.
Senator Ed Markey and I introduced the Protecting Community Television Act to block the FCCs proposal and bolster community TV.

"                                  Congressman Lance Gooden Destroys Speaker Pelosi's Attempt to Take Credit for USMCA  WASHINGTON, D.C. - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hopes to steal the spotlight now that the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has been signed into law."
"Credit for this historic trade agreement belongs entirely with President Donald J. Trump, his administration, and congressional Republicans."
Congressman Gooden joined Stuart Varney on Fox Business this morning to remind America that the only thing Nancy Pelosi can take credit for is the fourteen months she wasted by holding up the deal.
"To continue receiving updates like this,sign up for my E-Newsletter here."
Varney: I would expect President Trump to harp on that very theme - anger at the people trying to throw him out - when he appears today in Michigan.
"They're going to be heavily favored because of USMCA, and Iowa, where the farmers are going to do very well from USMCA."
I think the President is going to talk about that tonight.
Congressman Gooden: *Laughs* You think?
He is winning for the American people and Democrats hate it.
"And when he wins, and it's something like USMCA, where they have had to acquiesce and just finally give in - after 14 months they finally said, 'we'll let you have your agreement' - they've got to think of ridiculous things to try to dilute his win."
"They've said ""well it wouldn't have passed without us""."
"Well, let's just assume for a second that everything Nancy Pelosi said is true, why did it take 14 months?"
This is just ridiculousness.
The people across America - I believe - are seeing through this.
"           Official Site Constituent Services News Contact       U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells eNewsletter - - January 29, 2020         The USMCA is a Win for Kentucky Workers, Farmers and Consumers McConnell: 'By signing the USMCA into law, President Trump has delivered a strong trade deal for Kentucky families."
"I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk' Earlier today, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation formally agreeing to a landmark North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)."
"This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate."
"Senator McConnell said the following about todays signing: By signing the USMCA into law, President Trump has delivered a strong trade deal for Kentucky families."
"I was proud to lead the Senate as we sent the agreement to his desk, and I look forward to its benefits throughout the Commonwealth."
Virtually every family and every industry in Kentucky is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home.
"Once the USMCA takes effect, Kentuckys workers, farmers and consumers are ready to take advantage of all it has to offer."
Recently Senator McConnell penned the following column for Kentucky newspapers:  Kentuckians are rightfully known for being hard workers.
"Im glad more of them, from Paducah to Pikeville, are benefitting from our countrys strong economy, which has been bolstered by Republican policies."
The Republican-led Senate gave Kentucky workers another boost in an overwhelming vote by passing President Trumps landmark trade deal called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
"This deal represents a great win for Kentucky workers, farmers and consumers, and I was proud to shepherd the agreement through the Senate."
"Once in effect, the USMCA will modernize the trading framework that sends American goodsincluding Kentucky-made products like bourbon, cars, aerospace parts and agricultural commoditiesto customers across the continent."
"These critical upgrades reflect the development of the new digital economy, bringing the existing deal into the 21st century."
"Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats held President Trumps deal hostage for months on end."
Their obsession with impeaching the duly-elected president unnecessarily delayed the USMCA and its benefits for Kentucky.
American workers and families have paid the price of the Speakers refusal to work with President Trump.
"In Kentucky, the partisan obstruction couldnt end soon enough."
Virtually every family and every industry is touched by the job-creating effects of exporting more of what we make here at home.
"Farmers, manufacturers and logistics providers right here in the Bluegrass State put their ingenuity to work every day making a wide-range of products enjoyed around the globe."
"In 2018 alone, we sent more than $10 billion of Kentucky-made products to Canada and Mexico, representing nearly one-third of all our Commonwealths exports."
These sales support good jobs and a strong economy for Kentucky families.
"The USMCA is our chance to double-down on that success, giving our workers and our communities the certainty they need."
"The deals new, stronger automotive rules can extend the eye-popping 90 percent increase in motor vehicle exports Kentucky sold to our neighbors over the last decade."
"International sales of Kentucky-made cars and trucks can lead to more hiring, bigger paychecks and new investments."
Just ask the folks in Georgetownwhere Toyota recently announced it will hire about 400 new workersabout the benefits of trade.
"Its not just auto-manufacturing, either."
"Nearly 19,000 Kentucky manufacturing jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, including at more than 500 small- and medium-sized businesses."
"One study estimated the USMCA could help create 176,000 American jobs, strengthening our country and generating new opportunities for families and communities."
Kentuckys farmers are ready to take advantage of USMCAs innovations that will strengthen and expand markets for their crops.
Canada and Mexico bought more than $300 million of the Bluegrass States agricultural products in 2018.
"At a time when Kentucky growers are tightening their belts, we should do everything in our power to encourage more consumers to buy their wonderful products."
Job creators in our state have told me they can grow their businesses and benefit their communities with the USMCA.
"For example, the deal provides trade certainty to help our distillers by allowing more folks to raise a glass of Kentucky bourbon."
"Major Kentucky employers like UPS and DHL are also looking forward to USMCAs improvements to e-commerce and customs processes, designed to better protect small businesses competing in the online marketplace."
"Theyll be able to better connect businesses and consumers, while protecting the environment and American workers."
"By approving the deal, the United States is signaling to our neighbors that America is open for business."
"Once all three countries pass the USMCA, Kentuckys workers, farmers and consumers are ready to enjoy all the benefits it has to offer."
"Since the day President Trump signed the USMCA with leaders of Canada and Mexico, the deal should have been a no-brainer."
"Speaker Pelosi shouldve allowed this deal to pass months ago, but Im glad the heel-dragging has come to an end."
I hope Democrats will see what were able to accomplish by working together for the people who sent us to Washington in the first place.
"Then, they can put partisan distractions aside and work with us to continue delivering results."

"                        CONTACT  MEDIA                Dear Friend,  This week, the fundamental failure of House Democrats to prove their impeachment case is continuing."
President Trump's legal defense team was given their first opportunity to defend the case against the articles of impeachment in the Senate.
"During there presentations, the President's legal team dismantled claims made by the Democrat impeachment managers and proved this has been a partisan impeachment charade since day one."
"While Speaker Pelosi continues to waste her House majority on personal political vendettas, President Trump has been focused on strengthening Americas economy."
"He delivered another win for the American people by signing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law which brings North American trade into the 21st century and is a big win for American families, farmers, workers, and businesses."
"Along with delivering on the USMCA this week, President Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to lay out his bold plan for a peaceful two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians."

"I enjoyed seeing friends and neighbors as we honored the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the 40th annual Tampa Organization of Black Affairs breakfast, parade and uplifting interfaith service at Allen Temple A.M.E."
"This week I continue to feel inspired by Dr. Kings words: Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."
"Across the Capitol, the Impeachment trial of President Trump on his Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress continues."
Thank you for contacting Floridas U.S.

"Committee Action (SCCC Logo): I called on Google this week to take steps to stop the spread of dangerous climate denial and climate misinformation videos on YouTube, the most used social platform in the United States as it has done with other dangerous misinformation."
"Google should take steps to address this harmful misinformation, including ending free advertising of videos promoting harmful falsehoods about the causes and effects of the climate crisis."

"Since my first congressional campaign in 2006, I have supported a withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq and redeployment of U.S. troops from Afghanistan."
"Although the Constitution vests Congress with the sole power to declare war, President Trump like other presidents before him has taken military action without consulting Congress."
"I will vote in support of repealing the 2002 Iraq AUMF so that it cannot be used to justify new and unrelated, offensive military actions."
"943 - Never Again Education Act: On Monday, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the House adopted an important inititiave to combat antisemitism by passing bipartisan legislation to schools with tools to teach about the Holocaust."

Thank you to the many neighbors and community leaders I saw last week on collaborations to lift our Tampa area neighbors.
AARP joined me in highlighting the importance of the House of Representatives passing the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act to level the playing field for older workers and restoring their rights to fight back against age discrimination.
Members of my Puerto Rico Recovery and Assistance Task Force also joined me to discuss what Tampa nonprofit and community leaders are doing to assist families on the island and those who have relocated to the Tampa Bay area due to Hurricane Maria and recent earthquakes that continue to shake the island.
" News from Representative Allred                                          January 28, 2020   Dear Lindsey,  Last October, a series of tornadoes and storms swept through North Texas, leaving catastrophic damage across our communities."
"Now, months later, some of our neighbors are still picking up the pieces and struggling to rebuild their homes and businesses."
This is a priority for me.
I recently led a bipartisan group of my Texas colleagues in the House in writing a letter to President Trump urging swift approval of Governor Abbotts disaster declaration request.
"If approved, it would make much-needed disaster relief funds available to affected North Texans."
Rep. Allred surveys the damage left by the October storms to assess how he can help recovery efforts at the federal level.
"The Insurance Council of Texas has estimated that the tornado caused $2 billion in insured losses, making it one of the most costly natural disasters in our regions history."
"The federal disaster declaration would ensure North Texas receives the vital FEMA funds needed to repair our public infrastructure, strengthen our local economy and help many in our community get back on their feet."
I urge the president to sign Texas disaster declaration.
I am fighting every day to ensure that North Texas gets the recovery funds it needs.
"If you need help or have questions regarding storm recovery resources, I encourage you to call my office in Richardson at (972) 972-7949."
Economic Development Hits and Misses: AML and Baseball More Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Projects An economic development hit has been the continuation of the federal Abandoned Mine Land (AML) pilot program.
"On January 24, I joined the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy in announcing funding for two more projects through the AML pilot program."
"This round of funding is the latest to be awarded through the pilot program, which supports projects that reclaim land where mines once operated."
"The reclaimed land supports new economic activity, boosting development and job growth."
"Phase II of Project Intersection received $1,782,685."
A 200-acre site in Norton at the junction of U.S.
"Routes 23 and 58A, Project Intersection is the product of a regional partnership between the Counties of Lee, Scott, Wise, and Dickenson and the City of Norton."
It is developing the site for industrial and business purposes.
"The Mountain View Trail System, a multi-use trail that connects Coeburn and St. Paul in Wise County, will receive $222,000."
"These funds will go toward new signs, repairing and upgrading trails, installing bridges, and reclaiming features from abandoned mines such as open auger holes."
"As a result, visitors will enjoy a safer, improved experience on the trail."
Both of these projects are promising for new economic opportunities.
Project Intersection will help draw businesses to our area.
"Tourism, especially eco-tourism of visitors wanting to experience our natural scenery and adventure tourism such as ATV riding, has already brought visitors and economic benefits to our region."
Supporting assets like the Mountain View Trail System will further serve this purpose.
The funding we announced on January 24 came from the third straight fiscal year of appropriations for the AML pilot program in Virginia.
"In each of those years, I fought to include the Commonwealth in the program to make sure our abandoned mine sites were not overlooked."
"I am happy to say that Virginia was included from the start of the appropriations process for fiscal year 2020, and that funding has been signed into law."
Reclaiming abandoned mine land is an important step forward on the path to economic growth and job creation.
I am excited by the projects that have been supported so far and look forward to more to come.
Minor League Baseball A miss for economic development has been the concern over Minor League Baseballs future.
"Its not baseball season right now, but Ive been talking a lot about baseball lately to make sure there is a baseball season at all for some Minor League teams in our area."
Minor League Baseball is a pastime many of us enjoy.
It is a family-friendly and affordable activity.
"A sense of community is often built around our Minor League teams, and area businesses depend on them as well."
"Thus, I was greatly concerned to learn last fall that Major League Baseball (MLB) planned to cut 42 Minor League teams, including the Bristol Pirates, Bluefield Blue Jays, and Danville Braves."
The Pulaski Pirates and Salem Red Sox are not currently on the chopping block but cutting 42 teams understandably makes the others concerned for their futures.
"In response, I joined more than 100 Members of Congress in a letter to MLB in opposition to these cuts and became a member of the new Save Minor League Baseball Task Force."
I also spoke to the president of Minor League Baseball.
"During a recent stop in Bluefield, I heard more first-hand from representatives of the Appalachian League as well as individual Minor League clubs, including Bluefield, Bristol, Pulaski, and Princeton."
They expressed frustration with the actions of MLB.
"One of the Major Leagues demands of Minor League clubs is to upgrade facilities, but it has not detailed the standards it would find acceptable for the facilities."
"It also cites travel times between games, but the Appalachian League, which would be decimated by the cuts, has relatively short travel times compared to other leagues."
"Meanwhile, as the threat of elimination looms, none of the teams that MLB plans to cut can prepare for their next season or make improvements."
"Even if the cuts do not go into effect, they are damaging Minor League teams now."
Minor League teams have enjoyed an outpouring of support after MLB announced its plans.
"These teams are important to our communities and the communities economic well-being, and it is imperative that MLB recognize that fact."
"If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office."

"Update Regarding the Impeachment Trial Last week, the Senate gathered for the purpose of trying the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump."
"We began by voting to establish the rules for the trial, setting forth a fair process and an appropriate timeline for the proceedings."
The remaining work week was devoted to three days of opening arguments from the House of Representatives impeachment managers.
"The House failed to undertake its responsibility to collect supporting evidence, and the managers attempted to shift that responsibility to the Senate."
"On Saturday, the Presidents lawyers delivered the beginning of their opening arguments and will finish those arguments this week."
"Speaking with Kansans at the 47thAnnual March for Life On Friday, during a scheduled break in the Senate impeachment trial, I met with Kansans from Kapaun Mt."
Carmel High School and members of Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Wichita participating in the47th March for Life.
"Every year, Kansans travel to Washington, D.C. to march for the protection of the unborn, and every year, Im reminded by their actions that this is a fight we will never stop waging."
"It is an inspiration for me to visit with these marchers, especially young Kansans, who are supporting a cause that is greater than themselves."
"I want to thank the Kansans, and all the people who came out today, for marching for the unborn and speaking out for those who cannot speak for themselves."
"Urging HHS to Continue Delaying Changes to the National Liver Distribution PolicyThis week, Iurgedthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to continue delaying the implementation of changes to the national liver distribution policy until the conclusion of ongoing litigation."
"These changes in national policy would negatively impact patients awaiting transplants in Midwestern states, including Kansas."
"This policy will result in prolonged waitlist periods, increased costs and system inefficiencies, and it is in the best interests of patients and the transplant system as a whole to delay implementation of this policy until the matter is resolved in the courts."
"I have reached out to HHS Secretary Alex Azar multiple times in the past regarding this policy change, which ignores the recommendations of transplantation centers and experts in the United States."
I will continue working to protect Kansas and the Midwest from harmful national policies that disregard expert opinion.
"New WOTUS Rule Clarifies Jurisdiction On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new rule defining the waters of the United States (WOTUS)."
The Navigable Waters Protection Rule clarifies the jurisdiction the federal government and states have over waterways and provides a welcome change from the overreaching Obama-era WOTUS rule.
"The new rule reduces unnecessary regulations and allows Kansas farmers, ranchers, and other landowners to better utilize the water resources available to them."
"It is important that we work to protect our wetlands and waterways for future generations, while also providing clarity on the EPAs jurisdiction over our land and water."
"I will work with the administration to make certain its implementation continues to promote clean water for our communities and works for farmers, ranchers and other stakeholders."
"Urging Support for theNational Suicide Designation Act  This week, I urged my Senate colleagues to support legislation I sponsor, theNational Suicide Hotline Designation Act.This legislation would provide fast and widely available mental health support to those who need it by designating 9-8-8 as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, similar to 9-1-1."
"According to a 2017 report by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), suicide was the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming the lives of 47,000 people that year."
This tragic pattern is more prominent in vulnerable populations like our veterans community.
"Furthermore, the recent National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) indicated that the suicide rate for veterans in 2017 was 1.5 times the rate for non-veteran adults."
"While Americans currently have access to a ten-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a report produced by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), VA and others found that a three-digit hotline dedicated solely to national suicide prevention and mental health crisis management would significantly increase Americans access to potentially life-saving services."
"As a member of both the Senate Veterans Affairs and Commerce Committees, I remain committed to ensuring veterans and all Americans have timely access to professional-level resources for suicide prevention and mental health."
Welcoming KHA President Chad Austin Congratulations to Chad Austin who was recently named the next President and CEO of the Kansas Hospital Association (KHA).
"Tom Bell has been a terrific steward of KHA since taking over the role in 2005, and his hard work will certainly be continued by Chad in the future."
Chads work as Executive Vice President of KHA has equipped him to deal with the issues facing our hospitals.
I look forward to working with Chad in the future to improve our hospitals and protect them from the harmful impacts of federal legislation.
"Making the Air Capital Commitment  To make certain of a strong and unified response to individuals and businesses impacted by the 737 MAX production suspension, I joined the Aerospace Task Force, a group of local leaders and officials dedicated to the aerospace community in Wichita."

"I encourage all those impacted by the layoffs to utilize the website and, if experiencing an issue with a federal agency, contact my office for further assistance."
I am committed to ensuring Wichita has a bright future ahead as the Air Capital of the World.
"Thanking Brett Albright, My Senate Page  Friday was the Fall Senate Page Class award ceremony and farewell reception, which I attended to thank fall page and Kansan Brett Albright and his family."

"Throughout the past several months, Brett has done an exceptional job, and my staff and I have enjoyed getting to know him."
"Before he left, I made sure to wish him safe travels back to Kansas and best of luck in the future."
"Remembering Jim Lehrer  Jim Lehrer, a distinguished Kansan born in Wichita, was respected and admired across the board for his fair and ethical approach to journalism."
"His integrity led reporting on countless significant historical events - President Kennedys assassination, Watergate, the 9/11 attacks and many others - as well as moderating 12 presidential debates."
"Like so many others, I am well acquainted with his Good Evening, Im Jim Lehrer introduction to the PBS NewsHour, which was always followed by trusted news reporting."
"Last year, I attended the commissioning of the USS Wichita where Jims wife, Kate, was selected by the secretary of the Navy to be the ships sponsor."
"My thoughts and prayers are with Kate, his family, friends and former colleagues throughout this time."
"He will be greatly missed, but his impact will continue to be felt in journalism for many years to come."
"Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C."

I visitedBurks Beveragein Dyer County.
Burks Beverage has been a family run business that has distributed Pepsi products since 1931.
It was great to sit down with Eddie Burks and discuss how the current economy under President Trumphas helped the future of this business.
I appreciated sitting down with Dyer County Mayor Chris Young and former Alderman Bob Kirk.
It was great to learn how I can continue to best represent Dyer County up in Washington.

"Fighting for our Heroes  Last weekend, I had the honor and privilege of presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to deserving Filipino WWII Veterans who served our nation honorably and have not been treated appropriately by our government."
"When they agreed to fight under the direction of our military, they did so with President Roosevelt's guarantee that they would be treated as members of the U.S. military and would earn the same benefits as any other servicemember."
"However, after the war a subsequent U.S. President rescinded that promise."
"It wasn't until 2009 when Congress authorized a lump sum payment to these Veterans; however, many are still fighting for the care and benefits they deserve."
"While it was truly an honor to recognize their service and sacrifice, this situation remains a terrible injustice."
I will continue to fight on their behalf.
I also had the privilege of providing a brief legislative update to the Veterans' Club at Heritage Springs.
I thank these heroes for their service to our nation and appreciate their willingness to share their thoughts with me about how we can ensure Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.
It was a wonderful morning!
This alarming report is just one more reason that we need to keep investing in the critical research needed to find better treatments and a cure for ALS.
We must determine why Veterans are contracting ALS at a higher rate than non-Veterans and we must keep fighting for a cure for all patients who suffer with this catastrophic illness.
"Additionally, I agree with the author of this article that suicide rates among the Veteran community are still unacceptable."
We have to do more to support our heroes when they return from combat.
"Part of the solution is in providing alternative and complementary treatments, and we are doing that through the implementation of the COVER Act."
"However, we must do more to engage community stakeholders, which is why I am pushing for passage of the IMPROVE Act."
"This is a model that has proven successful in tackling other issues, and I believe it will help save the lives of our nations heroes."
"Preventing Homelessness  As I have said many times, fighting homelessness is a mission that is near and dear to my heart."
"Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Homeless Empowerment Program (HEP) in Clearwater."
"In addition to offering short and long-term housing options, HEP provides the wrap-around services needed to help clients attain stability."
"This includes: healthcare, mental health and substance use treatment, the chance to participate in community gardening, after school and summer camp initiatives for homeless children and financial literacy programs."
They also have specially-designed programs to assist homeless Veterans.
I look forward to working more closely with HEP and other providers as they continue their efforts to end homelessness in our community.
"Improving Healthcare Outcomes  Last week, I met with Ms. Elodie Dorso the CEO of Community Health Centers of Pinellas and Edward Kucher, the Chief Operating Officer."
"We discussed the exciting and innovative ways they are partnering with stakeholders to provide dental care, primary care and mental health/substance use treatment to residents of Pinellas and Pasco counties."
"In the past year, they have served 58,300 patients on a sliding fee scale basis."
"As a long-time supporter of the community health center model, I was eager to receive an update about the new dental clinic being built at the Tarpon Springs location."
They continue to work collaboratively to meet an urgent need in our community!
Combatting Human Trafficking  This report highlights some staggering statistics: -More than 1/5th of human trafficking victims are children (btw.
ages of 12-14)-The life expectancy for a victim after being taken is seven years-83% of human trafficking victims in our country are U.S. citizens-Florida's rate of human trafficking continues to climb These are just a of few of the many reasons that I continue to work on this tragic issue.
I've helped fund grants like the one just received in Tampa Bay to help form regional coalitions of stakeholders who work together to end human trafficking.
"We are also working at the federal level to strengthen protections for victims, raise awareness and end the facilitation of this horrific crime."
Together we can make a difference.
"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following email from a constituent in Hudson."
"Dear Congressman, I have had a wonderful experience with your office here in New Port Richey!"
"James and your staff made my situation, ""being declared deceased"" by Social Security , seem so much better than I expected!"
"As I explained to James, EVERYTHING in my name was frozen, deleted, or, just untouchable, thanks to something Social Security did to me."
"Your staff was more than accommodating, and I am truly appreciative in all of the hard work and dedication they put forth!"
"You should be very proud of your staff, and my wife and I are truly thankful!!"
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team enjoyed participating in last week's Grand Opening of the Tarpon Springs Distillery.
It is great to see new businesses thriving.
"Welcome to the community, Barry and Lisa Butler!"
"My team listened to Mark Gold, President of Mishorim USA and the new owner of The Grove in Wesley Chapel during this week's North Tampa Chamber's Economic Development luncheon."
Mr. Gold discussed his exciting future plans for this property.
It is wonderful to hear about the steps being taken to enhance our community.
My team was proud to help welcome the Rohr family to Pasco.
They opened a Chicken Salad Chick restaurant in Odessa-the first Pasco location.
There is one near my house in Palm Harbor and I regularly enjoy their food.
I look forward to eating at the new Pasco location as I travel throughout the district.
Welcome to the neighborhood!
My team had the pleasure of spending some time with the members of VFW Post 2550 in Dunedin.
"While there, my team provided a brief legislative update and received feedback about the newly authorized VA pilot project which will provide Veterans with expanded access to dental care."

"         Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window                     January 26, 2020      Dear Friend,  The impeachment trial is underway and Ive been in the Senate chamber listening to the detailed evidence presented by the House managers and the responses from the Presidents legal team."
I was very disappointed to see Republicans repeatedly vote against requiring the Trump administration to turn over relevant documents and having firsthand witnesses testify.
"I hope that before this trial has concluded, Republicans will allow for both these documents and witnesses to be included."
The American people want a fair trial and they deserve to see the full truth.
"As a juror, I took an oath to be impartial as I carefully review all the evidence and thats what Ill continue to do."
"Our founders believed, as I believe, that nobody is above the law in this country and thats why getting this impeachment trial right is so important."
It continues to be a great honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate.
Its been a busy week and the following is a brief update on just some of the issues Ive been addressing and working on.
"Turning the Tide of the Substance Use Disorder Epidemic   A roundtable discussion on the substance use disorder epidemic with first responders, treatment providers and community leaders in Derry."
"Treatment providers, first responders and families are working hand-in-hand to turn the tide of the substance use disorder epidemic facing our state."
"This week, I  respond to this crisis."
"On Tuesday, Senator Hassan, Representative Kuster, Representative Pappas and I called on the Trump administration to continue funding the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program in the Presidents budget proposal for fiscal year (FY) 2021."
The SOR grant program has been a vital tool for New Hampshire and other states on the frontline of the substance use disorder epidemic.
"Our success in meeting the challenge of this crisis is only possible if we continue to commit resources to support prevention, treatment and recovery for Americans struggling with substance misuse."
"On Wednesday,  to quickly provide new guidance to states on the implementation of the provision  that gives treatment providers flexibility to use federal funding provided by the SOR grant program to help patients suffering from meth and cocaine dependencies in addition to opioid use disorders."
"Previously, federal law only allowed SOR grants to be used by providers to treat patients suffering from opioid-related substance use disorders."
This new flexibility is a welcome change that will allow states like New Hampshire to remain nimble in addressing an evolving substance use disorder crisis.
"Holding E-Cigarette Companies Accountable  In New Hampshire, our high school students are using e-cigarettes more than their peers in every other state in the nation."
Teachers and parents are overwhelmed by the youth vaping crisisa crisis thats the result of e-cigarette manufacturers marketing their products directly to young people.
These companies should be on the hook for the funding to respond to this crisis.
"On Tuesday, I introduced  to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes."
"This legislation gives FDA the authority and resources the agency needs to hold e-cigarette companies accountable, crack down on e-cigarette sales to minors and raise awareness among youth about the dangers of vaping."
Congress and the Trump administration need to act to address this crisis and passing this legislation would be a major step forward.
"President Trump Recklessly Threatens New Hampshire Water Quality  Earlier this week, the Trump administration decided to move forward with plans to  that protect New Englands streams and wetlands."
"Considering the substantial water contamination challenges New Hampshire already faces, it is absolutely reckless of the Trump administration to overrule hard science and side with special interests to rollback these regulations."
Protecting our streams and wetlands is about preserving our natural environment and preventing chemicals from making their way into our drinking water.
Allowing pollutants to be dumped into New Hampshire's valuable wetlands without even requiring a permit is a direct threat to water quality in our state.
Families in New Hampshire need to have confidence that their tap water is safe.
This rule takes us in precisely the wrong direction.
An Important Anniversary for New Hampshire    Signing the resolution recognizing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a state holiday with Martin Luther King III.
Monday marked the 20th anniversary of New Hampshire first celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
This anniversary was personal for me.
"I fought alongside so many when I served in the New Hampshire State Senate for an appropriate way to honor Dr. King, the preeminent leader of the civil rights movement."
"Years later, as Governor, I was proud to sign the bill into law that ended New Hampshires status as the only state not to recognize his birthday as an official holiday."
It was an exciting time that reflected the positive change that many of us had seen in our lifetimes.
"We have made great strides since then in the march toward full equality, and these advancements are the product of Dr. Kings leadership and the peaceful, nonviolent protest movement that he championed."
"We Are Not Going Back   This week marked the 47th anniversary of the Supreme Courts Roe v. Wade decision  a landmark case that determined legal and constitutional safeguards for what many of us already morally believed to be true: womens reproductive health care decisions belong to them, not their government."
Roe has had a dramatic impact over the past 47 years.
"The Supreme Court decision ushered in a new era for womens health, reducing the number of dangerous back alley abortions and expanding access to family planning services and contraceptives, which have helped reduce abortion rates to historic lows."
"As we look back on decades of progress, we do so knowing that the rights secured by Roe v. Wade have never been more in danger since the decision was first handed down."
"Republican efforts to overturn Roe, restrictive state laws that seek to shut down abortion clinics, and the Trump administrations incessant attacks on family planning programs continue to put womens health at stake."
"Im inspired by the groundswell of activism by women and girls of all ages in response to these attacks on womens health, and I believe that together we can fight off these efforts and keep pushing forward."
We stand on the shoulders of generations of women who fought to get us here.
Contact My Office  One of my most important responsibilities as a U.S.
Senator is assisting New Hampshire residents who need help navigating federal agencies.
"Ive worked with my staff to help Granite Staters avoid foreclosure, secure military commendations, deliver delayed Social Security and Medicare assistance, and access VA benefits, among many other services."
"If you have an issue with a federal agency, you can open a case ."
"If it is time-sensitive, you can call my Manchester office at (603) 647-7500."
"Here are a few testimonials from Granite Staters who have been helped:  Denise Littlefield, Newmarket: Denise contacted my office after her family property in Londonderry was reduced in size due to eminent domain required for the expansion of I-93."
"Construction had led to significant impacts on the property, including the flooding of their parking area."
Denise had faced challenges getting the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to respond to the issue.
"My staff inquired with both agencies and after months of persistence, the flooding problem was addressed and her parking area was successfully restored."
"George Delaney, Manchester: George was put in touch with my office for assistance with his Social Security claim."
He was concerned he would lose his family home unless the situation was addressed quickly.
"My staff inquired with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and, within a few weeks, the SSA made a favorable determination and George received his first benefit check."

"      A message from Congressman Scott Tipton                            My Legislative Priorities for 2020 The second half of the 116th Congress has officially convened, and Id like to update you on some of the events you may have missed as well as share some of my legislative priorities for the rest of the year."
"While much of the media attention has been on the partisan impeachment process, there have already been some major wins for Coloradans."
"- Jan 15, 2019  Last week, the Senate finally passed the USMCA and sent the deal to the Presidents desk!"
"This landmark trade deal between our two biggest trading partners will bring greater trade certainty for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families across the country."
Colorados exports to Canada and Mexico totaled $2.7 billion in 2018 and the USMCA will support our states trade relationships for years to come.
"Before 2019 ended, I urged Nancy Pelosi to put partisan politics aside and hold a vote on the trade deal."
Im glad she listened and even more glad the Senate approved the package.
"Combined with the phase-one China agreement, under the current administration, the U.S. is making tremendous progress with our international trade partners."
Read my column on the USMCA in the Vail Daily here  Weve also made important progress in our quest to bring broadband internet to underserved communities in Colorado.
A recent FCC report shows there are rural areas in Colorado with less than 10 percent of the houses connected to broadband.
"In the 21st Century, this is a staggering statistic."
I have introduced a bill that would help the two federal agencies tasked with planning broadband buildout areas work more quickly and efficiently.
"By reducing bureaucracy and eliminating duplicative measures under the FCC and the USDA, it is my hope that the planning process for broadband deployment will be expedited, saving time and taxpayer money."
"Alongside this legislation, I recently announced a $2.7 million grant that will help bring broadband to Dove Creek, Colorado."
"High-speed internet is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity in rural Colorado."
"Heres an in-depth look at what broadband means to rural communities from the Colorado Sun  Veterans issues continue to be one of my top priorities, and I have been encouraged by innovation were seeing at the Grand Junction VA Medical Center and elsewhere in the district."
A new pilot program is helping veterans strengthen skills needed for employment after service.
"The Grand Junction facility is one of eight nationwide participating in this program, and its great to see success stories already."
I visited the medical center this month and was glad to talk to the staff about their recent achievements.
I believe that allowing the VA to test out pilot programs is critical to better address veterans issues.
"Congress gave flexibility to the VA for these programs when we passed the MISSION Act in 2018.Another impressive accomplishment there wasthat a recent remodel of the third floor came in seven months ahead of schedule and $200,000 under budget!"
"Tipton visits with staff from the Grand Junction VA Medical Center  Coinciding with the MISSION Act, Congress just approved a waiver submitted by the VA to establish another pilot program focused exclusively on improving dental benefits for veterans."
I applaud VA Secretary Wilkies commitment to improve dental benefits to veterans.
"Many of the more than 50,000 veterans living in our district are in rural areas and lack access to routine dental treatment."
"Along with these changes made to the VA, I have also introduced a bill to expand dental benefits to veterans with low-income."
A lack of access to dental health is a risk to veterans overall health.
"At the Glenwood Springs VA Medical Clinic, I was able to spend time with the staff and veterans there and discuss how we in Congress can continue to improve their care."
"This center is making great strides at providing veterans in rural areas of northwest Colorado a means to receive telehealth appointments, immunizations and many other services."
Tipton visits with veterans at the Glenwood Springs VA Medical Clinic  Id like to close by talking about Colorados natural resources and energy future.
My time in Congress has allowed me to support and promote the responsible development of natural resources through an all-of-the-above energy strategy.
"This type of model, implemented by the Trump administration, has led to a period of American energy dominance all while decreasing carbon emissions by 2.1 percent in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
"Its vital that our state learn the hard lessons of the devastating impactsstate-planned energy mandates have on small communities and instead work on plans that fit each communitys individual ability to provide affordable, abundant and reliable power to families and businesses."
"From the wind power production in Pueblo, solar farms in the San Luis Valley, hydro dams surrounding the Continental Divide, much progress has been made to bring clean energy to Colorado without heavy-handed legislation to force these changes."
"Alongside supporting renewable energy projects, I will continue advocating on behalf of other important energy infrastructure, such as the Jordan Cove pipeline and terminal project."
These projects will provide good-paying jobs to the West Slope and provide cleaner energy resources to nations with abhorrent environmental records.
"Read my column from last year regarding Jordan Cove  As much progress is being made around our district and state, there is plenty of room for improvement."
I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of Colorados Third Congressional District this year and addressing these issues and the many others impacting our district in the new decade.

"                                                  WEEK IN REVIEW  Dear Friend, I hope you had a great week."
"Its been a busy time in Washington, and while Ive spent a lot of my time fulfilling my obligation as a juror in the ongoing impeachment trial process in the Senate, Im continuing to work hard on behalf of Iowans and to deliver results for our state."
"Heres a quick snapshot from the past week   Replacing Obamas Harmful WOTUS Rule  This week, the Trump Administration officially announced the replacement to the Obama-era 2015 Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, ruleone that clearly defines what is, and what isnt, a federally regulated waterway."
"For years, Iowans have told me what an egregious overreach Obamas WOTUS rule was, giving the federal government authority to regulate 97 percent of the land in Iowa."
"Thats absurd, and its why Ive worked hard to get rid of it."
"After working relentlessly alongside the Trump Administration, Im proud that weve successfully scrapped this Obama-era rule and are now providing the predictability and certainty our hardworking farmers, manufacturers, and landowners in Iowa deserve."
"Under President Trumps leadership, weve fought to get the government off the backs of farmers and business owners and have had major wins on trade  like the USMCA, the phase one China deal, and the Japan agreement  all of which are spurring a sense of optimism and economic growth across rural America."
"Officially Sending USMCA to President Trumps Desk  After fighting relentlessly for more than a year to force House Democrats to finally move on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and after voting to pass the trade deal out of the Senate last week, I joined Senator Chuck Grassley, president pro tempore of the Senate, for the official bill enrollment ceremony to send the USMCA to the presidents desk for his signature."
Senate pro tempore Grassley signs the USMCA.
"At the ceremony, I highlighted how this major win will help Iowas farmers, manufacturers, and small businesses."
KCRG-TV covered the signing ceremony.

"Hosting Iowans in DC for the March for Life  Yesterday marked the 47th annual March for Life, a day when countless Americans across our nation, including many Iowans, show their support in defending life."
Every year Im encouraged to see the enthusiasm and goodwill this special event brings.
"In fact, I hosted hundreds of Iowans in Washington, D.C. before the march began!"

QA: U.S. Census 2020 Q.
Why is a population count taken every ten years in the United States?
When will Iowans receive their 2020 census surveys?
"Quick Links In my role as president pro tempore of the United States Senate, I ledan enrollment ceremony to sign theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act."
This historic trade deal with Canada and Mexico will be a boon for American workers.
It is now headed to President Trump's desk to become law.
"I was joined by many of my colleagues from states that will greatly benefit from USMCA, including Senator Ernst.You can find the full video of the ceremonyhereand the recap videohere."
"This week, President Trumpsuccessfully rolled back the harmful Obama-era Waters of the United States or WOTUS rule and replaced it with a workable rule that clearly defines what waters fall under federal jurisdiction."
The President deserves credit for following through on his promise to repeal this rule that would have defined 97 percent of Iowa as a waterway.Giving the federal government the power to regulate nearly all of Iowa would have been an economic catastrophe.
This new rule will help keep our water and land clean without destroying Iowas small businesses and family farming operations.
"As part of my ongoing oversight work, I recently sent a letter to the Department of Defense Inspector General seeking an investigationinto the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martins C-130J aircraft."
"Multiple whistleblowers contacted my office with allegations that, until recently, Lockheed Martin was manufacturing integral fuel tanks for the C-130J cargo plane in a potentially unsafe and hazardous manner."
Any and every contract with the American government needs to live up to the standards set out in law.
It appears like the deficient oversight of this contract left American workers in the lurch while the taxpayer money kept flowing.
"Whatever the reason, we ought to know why the department failed to provide oversight and recommend corrective action in a timely manner."
"                                                Hi there, The impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump began this past Tuesday."
"After three days of the House managers presenting their case, the Presidents legal team will finally get the chance to defend him today."
Cell phones and other electronics are strictly prohibited on the Senate floor during this time.
Ill do my best to keep you updated on social media during breaks in the trial as to whats happening and whats coming next.
"Follow me on social media for the latest updates every day:   Facebook:       Twitter: @SenCapito   Instagram:   #CapitoConnect Update  On Monday, I announced an $18.7 million broadband investment in Harrison County through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)s ReConnect program."
"This grant will support a high-speed broadband infrastructure project that will create or improve rural broadband for more than 6,300 rural households and approximately 383 farms in Harrison, Doddridge, Lewis, Barbour, and Upshur counties, providing over 400 miles of fiber-to-the-premises networks."
I created the ReConnect program within the appropriations process because I saw the need to close the digital divide in rural America.
Ive continued to support ReConnect enthusiastically because USDA uniquely understands the difficulties associated with implementing broadband in rural areas and is better equipped to tackle those issues head-on.

"Addressing Unfair Trade Practices Despite the Washington news media primarily focusing on impeachment, we achieved a huge victory last week for American workers."
"Last Wednesday, I went to the White House where I stood alongside President Trump as he signed the Phase One trade deal between the United States and China."
"China has been ripping us off for years, and this new deal works to address those unfair trade practices."
"Click here or on the image below for a quick recap of the deal:  For months, Ive been working behind the scenes closely with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to make sure West Virginia priorities were taken care of in the Phase One deal."
Im incredibly pleased to say both metallurgical coal and hardwood exports were included in the deal.
"This means burdensome tariffs on met coal and hardwood exports will be lifted, and this is a huge win for our state."

"West Virginia had $1.5 billion worth of exports to Canada and Mexico in 2018, and this much-needed revision ensures West Virginia manufacturers and transporters are treated fairly, and robust economic growth continues in North America."
"[Credit: ]   President Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico signed the USMCA on November 30, 2018, and it was passed overwhelmingly by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2019."
I am a member of three of the six committees that USMCA went through in the Senate before coming to the Senate floor for a final vote.
"Those committees include the Appropriations Committee, the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee."

Epimed is a medical device manufacturing company who focuses on high-quality and effective specialty devices.
"I was able to tour the facility and discuss my result of successfully repealing the full medical device tax, which was a top economic priority."
"Electro-Metrics Antenna Design is a leading designer, producer and integrator of antennas, sensors, and systems for broadband communications and testing."
One of my top priorities is growing our North Country manufacturing and expanding opportunities for defense contractors to work with the Department of Defense.
It is always amazing for me to see the production diversity that we produce in the North Country and to hear about ways that I can help support our manufacturers!
"Attending Fulton-Montgomery Regional Chamber of Commerce Event      Over the weekend, I was honored to attend the Fulton-Montgomery Regional Chamber of Commerce 2020 ""Cheers to Business"" event in Gloversville."
Ten businesses and individuals were honored for their success and contributions to our community.
I was proud to present copies of the Congressional Record to recognize each one of these businesses.
"Supporting local business in the North Country is critical to our local economies, and I will continue to advocate on behalf of businesses like these in Congress."
Statement On Being Named a Member of President Trump's Impeachment Defense Team  I was honored to be named by President Trump as a Member of his Impeachment Defense Team.
"Not only was there bipartisan opposition to impeachment in the House, Adam Schiff has continued to mischaracterize key facts."
"The facts are clear: there was no investigation into the Bidens, and Defensive Lethal Aid was provided to Ukraine by the Trump Administration."
The Democrats case is flimsy and weak.
"I am proud to stand up for the Constitution, my constituents in New Yorks 21st District, and the American peoples vote."
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:     ___________________  Featured Read: The Sun Community News -Stefanik co-sponsors legislation on new bail reform laws  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan Bills Promise Act, legislation that would direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of how individuals on pretrial release are monitored at the federal, state, and local levels."
"Under New Yorks new bail reform policy, cash bail is not required for most defendants accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felonies including those arrested for drug possession, or even many property crimes like theft and burglary."
"Instead, the law encourages alternatives such as supervision by a pretrial services agency."
The bill addresses issues surrounding pretrial release programs in New York and ensures communities are not put at risk; the legislation was carefully developed with input from the law enforcement and anti-violence advocacy communities.
"I am proud to co-sponsor this bill to address dangerous bail reform policies that continue to put our communities at risk, said Congresswoman Stefanik."
"This legislation will require an assessment of failed bail reform laws exactly like the one that Governor Cuomo has implemented in New York, which has had significant impacts in the North Country and put many communities at risk."
I stand united with local law enforcement and various members of our communities against these harmful bail reform policies and look forward to working with my colleagues to moving this legislation forward.

"     News from Representative Steve Womack          HOME  ABOUT STEVE  SERVICES  3RD DISTRICT  ISSUES  LEGISLATION  NEWSROOM       January 24, 2020    WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this weeks From the Front I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nations capital, including Thad and Kelli Butcher of Cave Springs."
Safe travels back to the Natural State!
"It was a districtworkweek, which means I got to spend time doing my favorite thing: traveling throughout Arkansass Third CongressionalDistrict!"
"I started my week in Russellville, where I stopped by Sequoyah Elementary School!"
The school was recently named a National Blue Ribbon recipient.
This distinction from the U.S. Department of Education recognizes outstanding and high-performing schools that demonstrate high levels of success from all of their students.
"Sequoyah Elementary has embraced and integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) curricula and created an innovative learning environment."
Another fun fact is that the Sequoyah Robotics Team 5805T won the Excellence Award at the VEX IQ Challenge Tournament last month.
Preparing students to excel in an ever-changing global workforce is a priority for educators and business leaders alike.
"Sequoyahs STEAM curriculum is developing competitive, well-rounded students and supporting our next generation of skilled workers."
"It was wonderful to meet with the 3rd and 4th grade classes and talk about education, leadership, service, and community!"
"I appreciated their engaging questions, which included Why did you run for office and What do you do as a Congressman?"
I told them to always lead by example and to be good influences on each other.
I then stopped by Russellville High School and had the opportunity to meet some fellow Cyclones.
It was great to able to meet the varsity basketball team and talk about the upcoming season.
"As you might know, Im a member of the RHS Class of 1975!"
Our region is home to many people willing to give back and improve the well-being of Arkansans.It was an honor to participate in a flag raising ceremony at the Arbors of Russellville.
"Taking care of our seniors is always a priority, and its important that we continue to support resources that help our elders."
Investment in research for things like Alzheimer's and other conditions will be vital to making progress towards a cure for many devastating diseases.
"The ceremony included the singing of the National Anthem, the introduction of Arbors staff members, and a dedication of halls to community members."
"I thank Herschel Howard and Mikel Fuller from the Marine Corps Lake Dardanelle Detachment for presenting the flag, which was previously flown over the U.S. Capitol."
"The next day, I headed down to Fort Smith to meet with the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority."
I appreciated getting a firsthand look at railway infrastructure and also talking about general development in our area.
The success of any city or nation is based on leadership and community.
"When residents are willing to get involved, work together, and develop local initiatives  the quality of life in an area increases."
It was a privilege to join residents who are part of Leadership Crawford County - which helps educate and motivate citizens to become local leaders - and discuss public service.Participants will act as catalysts for many important projects and developments in our region.
My next stop was to City Heights Elementary in Van Buren!
I met with students and recognized their distinction as a National Blue Ribbon School!
Their motto is Making a difference one student at a time!
"and they focus on small group instruction and utilizing engaging, student-centered programs."
"Im extremely proud that out of the two schools that received Blue Ribbon status in Arkansas in 2019, both were based in the Third District."
Its a true reflection of the hard work of educators and students in the Natural State!
"During the assembly, I got asked some great questions, including How do you become a Congress member?"
and What is your greatest accomplishment?
"I talked about my different positions throughout my career, including my time in the military, as a financial advisor, and as Mayor of Rogers!"
I was also able to talk about my challenge coin and hand them out to students.
"As I pointed out, the coin says: Lead by Example; Lead from the Front."
Im confident that these impressive students will take it to heart!
"I also dropped in to say hello to the Mayor of Alma, Jerry Martin."
"We had productive discussions on a variety of issues, including city priorities, growth, and the business environment."
"As both a Congressman and formermayor, I understand the importance of the work being done on the community level and appreciate hearing updates from our local representatives."
"Today, I started my morning in Fayetteville."
"I always appreciate having the opportunity to talk about government, civics, and leadership  and I loved spending time with students from Fayetteville Christian School."
Many of these students are learning about U.S. history!
My favorite question of the day: Did you ever meet George Washington?
"I might not have been around for the 1700s, but we do have the same hair color!"
"While I was there, one of the students also challenged me!"
I  of course  had my challenge coin with me!
"You know what that means: push-ups for my challenger, Zander."
"Even though I won the challenge, I decided to join in on the push-ups as well!"
Thanks to Fayetteville Christian School for the warm welcome.
I hope our conversations inspire students to think even bigger and reach their goals.
Maybe some will even run for student council!
"My next stop was to the University of Arkansass Startup Village, where I sat down with local startup teams and entrepreneurs, including Lapovations and AMBOTS."
The entrepreneurial spirit of Arkansas has led to the creation of Fortune 500 companies - and it is incredible to see people continue to harness the innovative heritage of our area and develop new technologies and businesses.
Washington needs to ensure that we are implementing policies that create an environment ripe with opportunity  not one that overregulates and stifles innovation.
Its always amazing to learn more about the work being done in the district - and to meet with the many people who are helping to unleash and support our strong entrepreneurial ecosystem.
I then drove toSpringdaleto take part in the ChamberofCommerces Banquet.
Weve seen a lotof growth and development - and gatherings like this support those efforts.
"A big congratulations to Jim Crouch, the recipient of the 2020 Civic Service Award!"
Our law enforcement officers serve Arkansas and defend our communities each day.
"They are our frontline protectors, and it was my honor to attend the dedication ceremony for the new Arkansas State Police Headquarters in Lowell."
Thank you to all of our men and women in uniform!
"ICYMI: This week, the Trump Administration announced the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which replaces the 2015 Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule."
The new directive provides regulatory clarity and ends Obama-era federal overreach.
This announcement marks an important step in restoring state authority and stopping improper federal overreach.
Localities are best equipped to manage the water and land within its borders  and this new directive rightfully reverses a power grab by Washington bureaucrats under the previous administration.
"With this new rule, we are protecting Americas waterways and providing certainty to hardworking farmers, ranchers, and landowners."
I have fought against the misguided Obama-era version of this regulation since it was introduced and thank the Trump Administration for taking decisive action and implementing a balanced approach.
Wishing you a great weekend!

"Here For You             Serving Californias 12th District At the same time that the Democratic House was busy passing over 400 pieces of legislation in 2019, my teams in the Capitol and San Francisco never lost sight of my purpose in Congress: to serve the constituents of Californias 12th Congressional District!"
"Whether it was urgent casework that needed attention or responding to a letter from a San Franciscan in need, my office has accomplished a great deal for those who have come to us for assistance."
Take a look below to see a sample of the progress that we have made for the people of San Francisco over the course of 2019!
"Remembering Terence Last Friday, San Francisco lost a dedicated public servant and defender of justice."
Former District Attorney and Member of the Board of Supervisors Terence Hallinan was a progressive icon and a champion for justice.
"His passing is a deep personal loss for his family and friends, and a profound official loss for our city."
Terence Hallinan was a proud son of San Francisco who embodied his familys tradition of public service.
"Whether as a member of the Board of Supervisors or as District Attorney, he never shied away from a fight or from standing up for what was right."
"Inspired by his years of civil rights and anti-war activism, Terence Hallinan understood and celebrated the beautiful diversity that enriches our city, and worked to expand opportunity for vulnerable and marginalized communities by ensuring that everyone had a seat at the table."
"In his work, he expanded the notion of what justice could mean, and in the process gave countless young people and non-violent offenders the support and resources needed to build a brighter future for themselves and their families."
Terence Hallinan leaves a powerful legacy of progress that will continue to inspire all those committed to justice and opportunity for all.
May it be a comfort to the entire Hallinan family that so many mourn with and pray for them at this sad time.
My office was able to assist a constituents family with information regarding their deportation hearing.
The constituent reached out to me because she had not been provided information about her upcoming hearing.
"After my office contacted US Citizenship and Immigration Services, my office was able to provide the constituent with the information needed for her hearing."
Caseworkers in my San Francisco office work to address any problems or concerns you may have with a federal government agency.
"To submit a Casework Authorization Form, please visit my website."
Please feel free to forward this information to your family and friends.
"              Website  Constituent Services  Contact                    Dear Alaskan,  Here are another five stories for your Friday that will keep you up-to-date on some of the things that I'm working on here in D.C.  Have a great weekend!"
"Senator Dan Sullivan     Impeachment Trial Begins in the Senate  This week, the impeachment trial of President Trump began in the Senate."
"Itake my constitutional responsibility on this matter very seriously, and I am paying careful attention to the proceedings and arguments put forward by each side."
"I've advocated for a full and fair hearing, which I think stands in stark contrast to the rushed and partisan process that took place in the House without due process protections for President Trump that have been afforded to presidents in the past."
"For Alaskans who are following the trial, I've set up a page on my website with a few resources, including the briefs submitted by House Democrats and the President's legal team, as well as my recent interviews on the topic."
"Latest on the Coronavirus  Many Alaskans have reached out to my office in recent days with concerns about the reported cases in the U.S. of a new coronavirus, which are all connected back to Wuhan, China."
"I just attended a briefing with senior federal health officials, including from the CDC, about the situation."
"Here are a few of my thoughts and what I learned at the briefing:       Honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   Julie and I had the pleasure of joining Pastor Parker and the wonderful congregation of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Anchorage for Sunday service last weekend with a special sermon on the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Once back in D.C., on Monday, I visited the powerful MLK Memorial near the National Mall, with its imposing stone statue of the civil rights icon, to reflect on what this courageous, once-in-a-generation American did to change the course of history for the better."
"UMSCA Trade Deal Passes the Senate   On the heels of the signing of the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreementwhich contained positive news for Alaska fishermenthe Senate recently passed yet another critical trade agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with even more positive news for Alaska.The USMCA, which constitutes an updated NAFTA, is the most significant change to North American trade policy in nearly 30 years."
"It will strengthen our countrys farmers, manufacturers, small businesses and, importantly, Alaska fishermen."
"Because of a provision I was able to get signed into law in 2016, mandating that fisheries be a principal negotiating objective in all future trade agreements, the USMCA features an entire chapter on fisheries, including phasing out subsidies, combatting illegal fishing, prohibitions on certain vessels and operations, and reducing and removing tariffs.The passage of USMCA will have benefits for our coastal communities, fishermen, processors, the larger fishing industry, and the entire Alaska economy for years to come."
Check out the full text of the agreement here.
"Holding the FCC's Feet to the Fire  A common frustration I've encountered during my time as a senator isfederal agencies forgetting about many of the communities they serve, particularly those situated far from D.C."
"In a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee this week, I pressed a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about the commission continually dragging its feet in advancing the deployment of broadband to rural parts of Alaska, often citing high costs."
"As I stressed to the panel, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 mandates that the FCC serve all Americans, providing comparable service to both urban and rural areas."
This isnt a suggestion.
I will continue to hold the FCCs feet to the fire so that they fulfill their statutory responsibility to Alaskans.
"               On the Hill with Denver Riggleman January 24, 2020 Friends,  It was great to be back in the 5th District this week."
Meeting with constituents is an essential part of my work in Congress and the opportunity to speak with youabout important issues is vital.
"On Tuesday, I met with students, faculty, and staff at Ferrum College in Franklin County."
We toured the campus and discussed the incredible work that is happening in the schools' agriculture and environmental science departments.
"We also talked about how students are preparing to enter the workforce in emerging industries, including hemp production."
"Wednesday morning, I had the pleasure of meeting with young students at Bonner Middle School in Danville."
It is always a pleasure to visit 5th District schools and talk to students about what it is like to be in Congress and the work that we are doing for them.
I also had the chance to meet with small business owners in the Danville River District and discuss the important work thatis happening to revitalize the area.
"Next, I spoke at the Virginia Agricultural Growers Association annual meeting in South Boston."
"Farming and agriculture are the largest industries in the 5th District, and I will always stand with our farmers."
We discussed the United States- Mexico- Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and how hemp can be atransformational crop for Southside.
"Afterward, I held a roundtable discussion with Sentara Halifax Regional Hospital."
"I joined local constituents and healthcare professionals to talk about how we can ensure all Virginia residents have access to quality, affordable care."
It has been a fantastic experience to travel across the 5th District this week.
I promise to continue working for you here in our district and in Washington.

The facts are clear: our free-market system works.
"Thanks to President Trump's business-friendly leadership, we've gotten our economy moving again:   7 million new jobs created."

"                                       NEWS FROM WASHINGTON AND ACROSS WEST TEXAS Dear Friend,  Last week we saw historic trade wins with the passage of USMCA and signing of the Phase One China trade deal."
I was privileged to welcome 27 farmers to Washington from throughout the South Plains to meet with lawmakers and discuss how policies like these help support those who feed and clothe our nation.
The House is in recess and I'm looking forward to spending time with constituents during my time back home this week.
Your voice is very important and I encourage you to please reach out to my office with any thoughts or concerns you have about what is going on in our country and communities.

West Texas Farmers Fly-In Nearly 30 farmers from all across the South Plains joined me in Washington as our historic USMCAand Phase Onetrade agreement with China became a reality.
"These West Texans wanted to tell the story of the food, fuel, and fiber capital and had a special message commending Donald J. Trumpfor securing a $50B agriculture purchase commitment - 2x the amount ever purchased by China before."

"President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush Coin Act Last week I spoke in favor of the President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush Coin Act sponsored by my friend and fellow Texan,John Cornyn."
"George and Barbara Bush were the ultimate examples of leadership, service and the purest picture of a loving and devoted marriage."
This coin will honor their lifetime of public service to our nation.
Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
"I'm grateful for Dr. Martin Luther King, an American hero, and his efforts to help us live up to our ideals as a nation that all men are created equal."
I remember learning about Dr. King as a boy.
I was moved by his courage and awe-struck by his strength of character in the face of such great persecution.
"But, what inspired me most about Dr. King was the way he chose to fight."
It was clear that his source of strength was his faith in Almighty God and his firm belief that love never fails (1 Corinthians: 13:8).
"Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative."
"Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you, and please forward this newsletter to our fellowWestTexans and encourage them tosign up here for this weekly update."

"                 WEBSITE  CONTACT SERVICES  NEWS                                 Dear Lindsey, A Great Week for Trade   Last Wednesday, it was an honor to join President Trump at the White House for the signing of the phase one trade agreement with China."
Farmers and manufacturers in Illinois rely on the Chinese market to sell their goods.
"With the phase one signing, our producers will begin to regain that access with a significant agriculture purchase agreement."
"In addition, U.S. companies will see a more level playing field in the areas of forced technology transfers and intellectual property rights."
"After more than a year of negotiations, I am pleased to see a phase one deal come together, and I applaud President Trump, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for their extensive work to negotiate this agreement."

"Read more: Rep. LaHood Applauds Senate Passage of USMCA    I stopped by theIllinois Chamber of Commercein Springfield recently to talk with President and CEO Todd Maisch about USMCA, the phase one trade deal with China, and more."
"In Illinois, trade = jobs and economic opportunity."
WATCH: Todd Maisch interview with Congressman Darin LaHood  Honoring Frank Mitchell on the House Floor       Rep. LaHood Honors Frank Mitchell on the House Floor    I went to the House Floor last week to honor and remember the life of Frank Mitchell.
"Frank of Springfield, Illinois made history in 1965 when he became the first African-American page in the U.S. House of Representatives."
"Nominated by the late Jacksonville, Illinois Rep. Paul Findley and appointed by then-Republican Leader Gerald Ford, Frank was a trailblazer in the House and opened doors for many that followed."
"Sadly, he passed away this Christmas after a fight with cancer."
My prayers are with his family and may he Rest in Peace.
"Human Trafficking Awareness Month   During January, we recognize National Human Trafficking Awareness Month."
"In Congress, I've been proud to support efforts to curb and end the human trafficking epidemic."
"Human trafficking continues to affect lives across the country, and I'll continue to do what I can in Congress to end this modern day form of slavery."
"As always, thanks for subscribing to my newsletter!"

"            Wicker Marks Two Years of Lower Taxes Higher Pay, More Jobs, and a Better Tax Code  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became the law of the land two years ago."
It represents the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the Reagan presidency - a longtime goal for Republicans.
"This tax reform came with a lot of promises, like higher economic growth, a simpler code, lower rates for middle-class families, and restored American competitiveness on the global stage."
"Two years in, every one of those promises has been kept."
The United States economy is reenergized and on stronger footing thanks in large part to this landmark legislation.
A Record of Success  The most obvious benefit of the tax cuts is increased take-home pay.
"A family of four making the median annual income in our country had their taxes reduced by $2,058."
"A single parent with one child and an annual income of $41,000 had their bill reduced by $1,304."
"All in all, 90 percent of workers are keeping a larger share of their money today than they were before December 2017."
"During the past two years, wages have surged particularly for low-income earners and those without high school diplomas."
"According to new data from the Council of Economic Advisors, earnings have grown faster among rank-and-file workers than managers."
"Additionally, wealth has grown at a higher rate for low-income Americans than the top one percent."
This good news directly benefits Mississippians.
"At a House Small Business Committee hearing, a grocer from Woodville reported that the law has allowed him to upgrade and replace equipment and provide employees with raises."
Shipbuilders on the Gulf Coast saw bonuses and larger contributions to their pensions.
"More than 100 areas in Mississippi are now opportunity zones, attracting private investment from outside sources to communities in need."
"An opportunity zone in Claiborne County alone could attract up to 1,000 construction jobs."
Tax reform has also helped our country become a net exporter of petroleum.
"The law opened up 2,000 acres in Alaska for responsible oil and gas development."
"More American energy means more jobs, a stronger economy, and less reliance on foreign and potentially hostile sources of oil and gas."
"Under our nations old tax code, our businesses were at an international disadvantage."
"Americas corporate tax rate was 35 percent, higher than any other in the developed world."
"The reduction to a 21 percent rate was followed by an increase in U.S. business investment, which has helped fuel our economic resurgence."
"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implemented a lot of new, good ideas."
"It also repealed burdensome rules and regulations, including the individual mandate in Obamacare."
"Under that failed provision, people who could not afford or did not choose to purchase Obamacares increasingly expensive plans were punished again with a new tax."
"This burden hurt low-income Americans more than any other group, and the repeal is a much-needed relief."
Pro-Growth Policies Work  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts success shows that pro-growth polices work.
"Unlike proposals to give more power to Washington, tax cuts restore decision making back to individuals."
"In doing so, they empower all Americans and help people and families across this country achieve their economic potential."
TWO BIG WINS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS There were two BIG wins for American workers this week.
"First, President Trump secured a historic trade deal with China."
"For too long, China has been allowed to be a bad actor."
"Phase one of this trade deal will work to rebalance our trade partnership with China to benefit American business, farmers, manufacturers and other hardworking Americans."
"Among other things, China has committed to purchasing an additional $200 billion in American goods over the next two years."
China has also agreed to purchase between $40 and $50 billion in American agricultural goods each year for the next two years.
"Also this week, the Senate just approved the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and it's headed to President Trump's desk."
"I was proud to vote for the USMCA in the House because It has been estimated that it will create more than $68 billion in new economic activity and 176,000 new jobs here in America."
THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats finally voted to send their articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate this week.
"Throughout their entire impeachment process in the House, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle demanded that it was urgent to impeach the President, and it must be done as soon as possible."
"However, after they voted to impeach, Speaker Pelosi let the articles sit on her desk for nearly a month."
This has proven to the American people that there was never an urgent need to impeach the President and has allowed the public to see what we have been saying all along  this is a sham impeachment based on political games and emotions instead of fact.
We discuss this and more on this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

"    NewsFrom Congressman Ben Cline                    Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline  With the impeachment Articles finally sent over to the Senate, the House can now begin focusing on the issues most important to the American people."
One of the highlights of the week was the signing of a historic trade deal with China which will help Sixth District farmers by dramatically increasing U.S. exports.
"Along the same vein, I joined my Virginia colleagues in supporting the Norfolk Harbor Project which will allow Commonwealth manufacturers to more effectively ship their goods overseas."
"While it was a busy week in Washington, I had the pleasure of visiting with students throughout the District and am looking forward to meeting with constituents in Lynchburg and Roanoke City during the coming weeks town halls."
"Impeachment:  For months, Democrats called impeaching the President urgent - yet 28 days went by before the Speaker transmitted the Articles to the Senate this week."
"This attempt to grab headlines exposed what Americans already knew, that impeachment was nothing more than political theater."
"This show has been at the expense of working on truly urgent matters like fixing our crumbling infrastructure, reforming our broken immigration system, and getting USMCA across the finish line."
"Further, the delay once again denied the President the right to due process that is afforded to every American."
"Phase One Trade Agreement  USMCA:  This week President Trump continued to make progress in working towards negotiating better, fairer trade deals for the United States."
"On Wednesday, the President signed the Phase One Trade Agreement with China which will serve as a tremendous boost to American businesses, farmers, manufacturers, and innovators."
"At the core of this deal, China has pledged to increase American imports by $200 billion over the next two years."
"Of that, $40 to $50 billion will be on agriculture products, $75 billion in manufacturing goods, $50 billion in the energy sector, and $40 billion in financial services."
"Further, this deal addresses longstanding intellectual property and trademark concerns and will establish enforcement mechanisms against pirated and counterfeit goods."
This trade agreement rebalances the playing field for the United States and China and will be beneficial to both countries.
This deals comes on the heels of the Senate approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.
"The measure creates a more level playing field for American workers, strengthens agricultural trade, and modernizes intellectual property protections."
"USMCA is a win for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses and will create 176,000 new jobs and add $68 billion to the U.S. Economy."
I look forward to the President signing this Agreement into law.
Supporting the Iranian People:  The United States has always and will always stand for freedom and democracy around the world.
"Following recent actions by the Iranian government, the nation's people took to the streets todemand accountability and express their collective desire for the country's leaders torespect human rights."
"Iran has a violent history when faced with opposition from within its borders, and the government killed 1,500 demonstrators as recently as November of last year."
"In response, I cosponsored a resolution this week introduced by Leader McCarthy condemning the Iranian government and supporting the protesters."
"Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi rejected this resolution in yet another purely political move."
"Norfolk Harbor Project:  This week, I was proud to join my Virginia colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to the Office of Management and Budget requesting additional funds for the Norfolk Harbor Project."
"This critical infrastructure project will widen and deepen the port and add an additional traffic lane, making it more capable of handling mega container commercial vessels and ships."
"Not only will this increase the Harbors competitiveness and further connect Virginia to global markets, but it will also enable continued operational successes for our service members at Naval Station Norfolk."
"Despite the headlines of gridlock in Washington, this project is just one example of legislators from both parties coming together to support an initiative that is beneficial to the Commonwealth as a whole."
School Visits:  I am always excited to discuss government and how legislation becomes law with students across our region.
This week I had the pleasure of chatting with government classes from opposite ends of District at both Lord Botetourt High School in Daleville and Skyline Middle School in Harrisonburg.
Opportunities like these allow me to answer students questions and engage in constructive dialogue about the issues that matter most to my younger constituents.
"Town Halls:  Prior to the new year, I hosted nineteen town halls  one in each locality  and plan to continue holding events like these throughout my term."
"Already in 2020, I have hosted three such forums in Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Botetourt County."
"This coming week, I will hold two additional town halls in Lynchburg and Roanoke City."
"In order to accommodate the diverse schedule of Sixth District constituents, I have rotated all ofmy town halls between morning, lunch, and evening meetings."
Citizens of these two localities will be given priority regarding comments during the town hall.
