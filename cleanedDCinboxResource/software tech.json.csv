"The President's FY2021 Proposed Defense Budget Reduces B-1B Fleet in Transition to B-21  Now more than ever, our military needs additional combat power to meet the threats identified in the National Defense Strategy and, as a result, both the Air Force and Congress understand the need to accelerate the deployment of the new B-21 Raider as a fundamental part of that mission."
"Ultimately, Congress is responsible for establishing the budget; therefore, I will be closely reviewing the administrations recommendation and analyses and working with them to arrive at the right resources and plan for transitioning from the B-1 to the B-21 bomber in a way that ensures the most cost-effective strategy for defending our nation, the highest safety for our airmen, and the least disruption to base operations."

The bill amends the National Gas Act to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to set a refund effective date and order a refund when an interstate pipeline is found to be overcharging for its services.
FERC currently has these authorities under the Federal Power Act to order refunds from interstate electric utilities when they determine overcharges have been made.

"     News from Representative Steve Womack          HOME  ABOUT STEVE  SERVICES  3RD DISTRICT  ISSUES  LEGISLATION  NEWSROOM       January 31, 2020    WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this weeks From the Front I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nations capital, including Daren and Laura McMillen of Prairie Grove and Danny and Carmen Aldridge of Fort Smith."
Safe travels back to the Natural State!

"It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!"
"This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month."
David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead.
"They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation."
Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .
Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico  two of Arkansass top trading partners.
"The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity."
"For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs."
"The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this weeks signing delivers a 21stcentury trade framework."
"This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural States world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansass hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families."
"Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansass exports."
"Afrom the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million."
"Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand."
Its exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December.
"By negotiating from strength  the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy."
This landmark agreement puts America first!
I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line.
"Promises made, promises kept!"
The President also announced his .
"The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people."
"With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East."
No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone  and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation.
"On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future."
Centuries of hostilities wont be solved overnight  but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path.
"I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region."
Its noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda.
"While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America."
"The results speak for themselves  thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created."
"In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations."
"We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt."
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory.
"Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year."
"On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic."
It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion.
"Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030."
Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window.
"Our countrys unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt."
"Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030."
"To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget."
"Weve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously."
"Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt."
The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.
"It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them."
Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions  which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country.
"Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesnt appear that well have one this year either."
"In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year."
"Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, were not doing a budget."
It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face.
We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people.
"Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State!"
"I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies."
"I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith  who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association  to discuss the Community Development Block Grant programand other initiatives that support housing and community development."
The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators.
"It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the Universitys priorities."
I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas.
"I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas."
"They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development."
"I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell  and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District."
"My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare."
I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year.
The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief.
"While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House."
"The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence."
"Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient."
"Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith."
The funding  awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA)  will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD).
These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.
Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District.
"This investment supports their work to promote entrepreneurship, attract new businesses, and encourage job creation."
"By providing resources to those who facilitate collaboration and identify growth opportunities, we are laying the foundation for long-term prosperity and development in our communities."
Wishing you a great weekend!

"The trial began with three days of the House Impeachment Managers making their case for removal, followed by three days of the Presidents attorneys defending him."
Senators then submitted written questions which the Chief Justice read aloud and the House Managers and the Presidents attorneys responded to.
"On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives continued advancing its agenda for the people by introducing and passing bills, holding hearings, and oversight of the Executive Branch."
"As I write this to you, we await the decision of the full Senate as to whether witnesses and documents will be allowed in the trial."
"Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week   CDC Briefing on Coronavirus I met with Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response; and Rear Admiral Denise Hinton with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."
"The coronavirus is a respiratory illness caused by a virus first identified in Wuhan, China."
"Most of the known cases and all deaths associated with the disease have been in China, with only seven confirmed cases in the U.S. to date."
"According to the CDC, the risk to the American public is low, unless someone has recently traveled to Wuhan and is experiencing respiratory symptoms."
"For the latest information about the coronavirus, visit the CDCs website."
"To prevent transmission of diseases, two simple but powerful acts of prevention are recommended."
"Wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly, and cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and everyone should get a flu shot."
"Questioned the CEO of PGE at House Energy and Commerce Hearing on Wildfires  The two most destructive fires in Californian history, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed over 18,000 buildings, were linked to PGEs equipment."
"On January 29th I grilled the CEO of PGE, Bill Johnson, about the utilitys widespread intentional blackouts at a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Environment  Climate Change on the impact of wildfires on the power sector and the environment."
You can watch my questions from the hearing HERE.
Addressing the scourge of wildfires in California continues to be a top priority for me.
"Last October, I introduced the Smoke Planning and Research Act to provide federal funding to help communities research, develop, and implement plans to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke."
Im also pushing hard to strengthen infrastructure to withstand wildfires.
"In July, 2019, I introduced the WIRED Act to allow states to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that will be resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters."
"Currently, states lack this authority and the consequences have been dire."
"Health Subcommittee Hearing on Food and Drug Safety  As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine ten mostly bipartisan bills to improve the safety and transparency in our food and drugs."
Twenty cents out of every dollar spent by American consumers goes toward food or medicine regulated by the FDA.
We examined the FDAs immense mission with two panels of expert witnesses.
Our first panel considered four bills to grant the FDA new authorities to tackle challenges that threaten our drug supply.
"Taken together, these bills improve the drug supply chain from the very beginning to the very end so that patients have access to quality products that are genuine, affordable, and accurately labeled."
The second panel considered six bills that affect the FDAs oversight of food products.
Many of these bills act on decisions that the FDA has long delayed.
"For example, we heard about one bill, the FASTER Act, which would require food manufacturers to list sesame as an allergen on their products."
It would also fund into federal studies to better understand the growing prevalence of food allergies in the United States.

"To add insult to injury, the President failed to properly consult Congress or seek the legal authority to take military action against Iran."
"The Administration has also failed to fully explain what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the U.S. that required the strike."
"No Member of Congress carries a brief for General Soleimani or the Iranian government, but no President has the unilateral authority to take our nation to war without authorization from Congress."
The No War Against Iran Act underscores that Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Iran.
It also prohibits federal funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.
"Ive long had concerns about the Trump Administrations provocative behavior toward Iran, beginning with the President tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, and its why I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act last April."
My bill restricts this Administration and any future administrations from using any funds appropriated by Congress to take military action in and against Iran without authorization from Congress.
House Infrastructure Package  This week the Majority released our framework for a five-year $760 billion infrastructure bill.
"The framework addresses our nations crumbling infrastructure by investing in zero-emission vehicles, expands access to broadband, upgrades clean water infrastructure, and creates an estimated 10 million new jobs."
"The package also authorizes $12 billion to modernize our countrys 9-1-1 systems, based on my legislation the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act."
You can read more about the infrastructure plan HERE.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Workforce Mobility Act  I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help workers by prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements."
This occurs when an employer restricts an employees future prospects through their employment contracts.
"While California has long prohibited non-competes, 40 percent of Americans have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point in their career."
"Reps. Scott Peters, Mike Gallagher, and I introduced the Workforce Mobility Act to ban non-compete agreements with a few narrow exceptions (such as the sale of a business)."
"Much of Silicon Valley was built by former employees of one tech company leaving to found another, all allowed because of Californias ban on non-compete agreements."
This ban continues to allow the Valley to prosper as an innovation powerhouse.
"Im proud that my legislation will make this a nationwide policy, ensuring all Americans have the ability to innovate."
"The Protecting Community Television Act  Community television is a critical part of our society, giving a voice to nonprofits, artists, schools, local governments, and other community members who otherwise struggle to be heard."
I introduced legislation to ensure that community television operations continue to receive the resources they need to educate and inform viewers in the cities and towns where they operate.
"Today, local governments are permitted to require that cable companies meet community needs by providing in-kind contributions that benefit public, educational, and government (PEG) channels, also known as community television stations."
Unfortunately the FCC proposed regulatory changes that would effectively end the in-kind contributions that support PEG stations.
Senator Ed Markey and I introduced the Protecting Community Television Act to block the FCCs proposal and bolster community TV.
"Weekly Highlights  Meeting with the Foreign Minister of Laos  This week I had the honor of welcoming the Foreign Minister of Laos, His Excellency Saleumxay Kommasith, and the Laotian Ambassador to the U.S., His Excellency Khamphan Anlavan, to my Washington, D.C. office."
"My work to fund the removal of unexploded ordinances, such as landmines in Laos from the Vietnam War era has received bipartisan support in Congress and will save the lives of so many who remain vulnerable to these landmines."
Ive championed this issue by co-leading the Legacies of War Recognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act.
"In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies."
"Over 6,446 constituents have already contacted me in 2020."
I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me.
"This week, 1,289 constituents contacted our office about issues including:   137 constituents wrote to me about H.Con.Res."
"52 which expresses the sense of Congress that there is an ongoing climate emergency  87 constituents wrote to me about the Helping MOMS Act to help expand access to Medicaid coverage for expectant and new mothers  46 constituents wrote to me about the Childrens Product Warning Label Act to strengthen cosmetic product safety  Annas Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from."

"Senator Rick Scott said, Following many conversations between my office and the Interior Department, Im glad to see the Department is putting national security first and adopting a no-fly rule for drones made in Communist China."
The Trump administration sees the risks associated with using taxpayer dollars to purchase tech from a Communist government that is trying to spy on us.
This is great news for our security.
"Now, we must pass my bill to codify this policy and extend it to all federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement agencies that use federal grants."
We must take the threat from Communist China seriously.Read more HERE.

"Senator Rick Scott: If Anyone Supports Maduro, I Wont Stay Quiet  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement after the law firm of Foley  Lardner heeded the Senators call to drop its client, Inspector General Reinaldo Muoz, the top lawyer for Nicolas Maduros brutal regime in Venezuela."
"Senator Rick Scott said, This week, I raised questions about the $12.5 million Foley  Lardner received to represent the illegitimate Maduro regime and announced that I would no longer meet with anyone from that firm."
Im glad they made the right decision to drop the Maduro regime as a client and return the money.
Its unfortunate they made the decision to give this murderous dictator legitimacy in the first place.
I would recommend to Foley  Lardner that they get involved in support of the people of Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro is perpetrating a genocide on the people of Venezuela.
Ive been to the border between Venezuela and Colombia.
I met young mothers who trek hours through the jungle just to get their only meal of the day.
I met children who travel through FARC-controlled territory to Colombia to go to school  the only way they can get an education.
"Thousands have died, millions have fled, and Maduro and his cronies have gotten fat and rich."
"I hope the last few days will serve as a lesson to any other lobbying firms, consultants or organizations that if you support Maduro and his gang of thugs, I wont stay quiet.Read more HERE."

Me alegra que hayan tomado la decisin correcta de abandonar al rgimen de Maduro como cliente y devolver el dinero.
Es lamentable que hayan tomado la decisin de dar legitimidad a este asesino dictador en primer lugar.
Le recomendara a Foley  Lardner que se unan en apoyo al pueblo de Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro est perpetrando un genocidio contra la gente de Venezuela.
He estado en la frontera entre Venezuela y Colombia.
Conoc a madres jvenes que caminan durante horas por la jungla solo para obtener su nica comida del da.
"Conoc a nios que viajan a Colombia a travs del territorio controlado por la FARC para ir a la escuela, la nica forma en que pueden obtener una educacin."
"Miles han muerto, millones han huido y Maduro y sus amigos se han engordado y enriquecido."
"Espero que los ltimos das sirvan como una leccin para cualquier otra firma de cabildeo, consultores u organizaciones que si apoyan a Maduro y su banda de matones, no me quedar callado "".Lea ms AQU."
"Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Trump Administration For Heeding His Call to Declare Coronavirus a Public Health Emergency  Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trumps decision to declare the 2019 Novel Coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States, and announcement that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended entry into the United States."
This decision follows Senator Scotts call last week for the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.
"Last Wednesday, Senator Scott sent a letter to the CDC Director requesting information about the agencys plan to combat the threat of the coronavirus and urging quick action to protect the health of American families."
"Senator Rick Scott said, Last week, I called on the Administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States, and I am glad they heeded that call today."
"Just like we did in Florida to curb the spread of the Ebola and Zika viruses, we must take action to make every resource available to contain the disease and keep Americans healthy."
"We still need to take additional steps to protect Americans, including increased screening and inspections on all products and produce coming into the United States from China."
China needs to do more to keep the world community accurately informed about the spread of the virus and follow Americas lead to ground Chinese commercial flights.
"Sen. Rick Scott Warns UK: Allowing Communist China in Your Networks is a Mistake  Ahead of the United Kingdoms decision to allow Huawei, a China-based company backed by the Communist Party of China, to build part of its 5G infrastructure, Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner warning the U.K. about the extreme risks associated with this decision."
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, Johnson and other U.K. leaders must be extremely careful when it comes to the threat of communist China and the implications for the United States relationship with the U.K."
"Put simply, the U.K. allowing Huawei to gain a foothold would be a grave mistake."
Huawei is a bad actor across the globe.
"Its a company that aids the communist regime in Beijing, which continues to violate human rights, steal our data, technology, and intellectual property, and build up their military to compete with us and other freedom-loving countries."
Countries that do business with Huawei eliminate their citizens and their countrys privacy rights.
Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party are one and the same.
"If the U.S. is going to consider a trade agreement with the U.K., it is imperative that Huawei is recognized as a threat to our national security partnership."
The U.S. must put any trade deal with the U.K. on hold until Johnson commits to take swift action to ensure Huawei will not be used in their transition to 5G networks.
This is for the security of both the U.S. and the U.K.  Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE.
Sen. Rick Scott: Peace Corps Needs to Stop Wasting Taxpayer Dollars and Get Out of Communist China Immediately  Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent op-ed on the Peace Corps decision to end its programs in Communist China.
Senator Rick Scott also sent a letter to the Director of the Peace Corps requesting a detailed outline of the Peace Corps plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China.
"In the letter to the editor, Senator Rick Scott wrote, Ive met with the Peace Corps director multiple times and asked her what the volunteers did in Communist China and why they were there."
"When I asked what the return on investment was for the U.S. taxpayers, the director (shockingly) had no answer."
The Peace Corps finally came to its senses this month and said it is leaving Communist China.
"Since then, the director has refused to meet with me."
"I would love to hear its plan for a speedy withdrawal from Communist China, but Im not holding my breath."

Florida is home to the best airport in the nation!
"This week, Orlando International Airport was ranked the best large airport by USA Todayin its 10 Best Readers Choice travel awards."
"                                 Dear Lindsey,  Across the United States, 240,000 students have been deceived or defrauded by failed for-profit colleges and appealed to the federal government for debt relief."
"1,000 of these students are from Connecticut."
"In September 2019, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released a rule aimed at rolling back borrower defense protections, which allows students to receive loan forgiveness when they have been victims of predatory for-profit colleges, such as Corinthian or ITT Tech."
The rule creates a new three-year time limit for borrowers to submit loan forgiveness claims.
It also requires defrauded students to prove personal financial harm in order to access relief.
"In addition, the rule requires the Department of Education to review every case individually, even if the institution had already been proven to have engaged in misconduct."
I voted with mycolleaguesin the House of Representatives to overturn the Department of Education's ruleand stand up for students defrauded by for-profit colleges throughout the United States.
"I fought for this resolution to protect students from institutions which award degrees that have no value, insurmountable debt, and no means of accessing justice."
"On December 12, 2019, the HouseCommittee onEducation and Labor held a hearing examining the Department of Educations implementation of Borrower Defense."
"During this hearing, I pressed Secretary DeVos on her efforts to undermine this vital policy."
I will always advocate on behalf of our nation's hardworking students.
"Last year, I introduced legislation to make it easier for students defrauded by closed institutions to qualify for loan forgiveness."
"The Pell Grant Restoration Actwould restore a student's Pell Grant eligibility to allow them the chance to get an education at a credible institution, which will provide them with the credentials necessary to succeed."
I willcontinue to champion student protections and ensure all people in the 5th District have access to a quality and affordable education.

"USMCA Heads to the Presidents Desk for Signature On Thursday, I voted in favor of approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on the Senate floor."
The agreement was approved overwhelmingly in the Senate and will now be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature.
"Passing USMCA is a major step in implementing this 21st-century trade deal and providing needed certainty for Kansas farmers, ranchers and manufacturers."
Over one-third of Kansas exports go to Canada and Mexico making those countries Kansas two largest export markets.
"On Jan. 3, IurgedMajority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to consider USMCA as soon as it passed out of the appropriate Senate committees."
"I voted Wednesday in both the Senate Appropriations and Commerce Committees to pass USMCA, moving it to the full Senate for a vote."
I appreciate Senate leaders listening to my request and quickly moving this important trade agreement to a vote on the Senate floor.
"Over the past two years, I have consistently advocated for a deal like USMCA to be reached."
"I have heard directly from many Kansas producers on the vital importance of a modern trade deal that expands export opportunities, and I applaud President Trumps work to get this trade deal accomplished."
"To view the timeline of my efforts on a modern trade deal, clickhere."
"Update Regarding the Impeachment TrialAt noon on Thursday, seven House managers delivered and read the articles of impeachment to the Senate."
"Shortly after 2 p.m., Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was escorted into the Senate chamber and sworn in as the presiding officer."
"After he was sworn in, Chief Justice Roberts swore in each U.S."
Senator and then we individually signed the oath book.
The oath represents a pledge to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law.
I take this oath and responsibility seriously.
"The impeachment trial will officially begin on Tuesday, January 21, 2020."
The Senate will first set the rules of the trial and then we will move to oral arguments.
The trial will be held every day at 1 p.m.
"ET, Monday through Saturday, until we reach a verdict or dismiss the charges."
"Meeting with NASA Astronauts, including Kansan Nick Hague On Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet with NASA Astronauts Anne McClain and Nick Hague."
Both recently served as flight engineers on expeditions to the International Space Station.
Astronaut Hague is a Kansas native and graduated from Hoxie High School in 1994 before serving in the United States Air Force.
"During Expedition 59/60, Hague conducted three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 56 minutes with a total of 203 days in space before returning to Earth in October 2019."
"After he returned to Earth, I took the opportunity to speak with him over the phone to tell him how proud Kansans are of him and how often I get to brag about his accomplishments serving our country."
"It was great to talk with Astronaut Hague again and as Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee on Appropriations, I enjoyed getting a chance to discuss both of their missions and the resources that are vital to their success."
"At the end of our meeting, Astronaut Hague presented me with a Kansas flag that was flown by him at the International Space Station."
I look forward to displaying the Kansas flag in my office and having the opportunity to share this with the many Kansans who visit my office.
"Attending the Signing Ceremony for the Phase One China Trade Agreement  On Wednesday, the United States and China signed an historic trade agreement that will open new trade opportunities for farmers and manufacturers across Kansas."
I was pleased to join President Trump at the White House for the signing ceremony.
This agreement includes a commitment by China to purchase at least $40 billion annually in agricultural products from the United States each of the next two years.
"This agreement is also a first step in addressing Chinas misbehavior on trade, such as the theft of American intellectual property and forced technology transfer."
Congress must work to make certain China lives up to its agreement and hold China accountable if its bad behavior continues.
I will continue to urge the administration to reach an agreement with China that removes U.S. tariffs and Chinas retaliatory tariffs that are damaging to Kansas.
"Attending the American Farm Bureau Federations Annual Convention This weekend, I attended the American Farm Bureau Federations Annual Convention to speak with farmers and ranchers from across the United States about making certain rural America has a voice in Congress."
"An important part of this conversation centered around access to healthcare and broadband, which allows the rural way of life to be sustained."
"It was also great to discuss the recent vote by the Senate to approve USMCA, ensuring further trade certainty for farmers."
I also highlighted my trip to the White House for the signing of Phase One of the China trade agreement by President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He which should be significant for the economic well being of farmers and the U.S. economy.
"Town Hall Project Announces 2019 Awards  This past week, Town Hall Project released their end of year report and announced that I held 73 town hall meetings in 2019  the most town halls of any member of Congress."

"Town halls are a part of my Kansas Listening Tour, a priority throughout my time in Kansas to stay connected to the Kansans I represent."
"Every Congressional session, I visit each of Kansas 105 counties, and the conversations I have help drive the work I do in Washington, D.C."
Thank you to each Kansan that I have spoken with during my time in Congress for sharing your thoughts and ideas with me.
I look forward to many more Kansas Listening Tour stops in 2020.
"Recognized as a 2019 Wheat Advocate  On Thursday, I met with representatives from Kansas Wheat Commission."
"During the meeting we discussed a variety of issues, including the importance of trade and exports to Kansas farmers, the Federal Grain Inspection Service reauthorization, international food aid and federal funding for wheat research."
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, I secured resources for critical wheat research initiatives, including the Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative, which develops control measures forFusariumhead blight, or scab."
I was also honored to be presented with the 2019 Wheat Advocate Award from the National Association of Wheat Growers during the meeting.
"Our wheat growers are critical to the global foodsupply, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside Kansas Wheat Commission to improve the outlook for agriculture in Kansas."

Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week  Voted YES on War Powers Resolution   The House voted to require President Trump to immediately terminate military operations against Iran.
The President has taken our nation to the brink of war without properly consulting Congress or seeking the legal authority to do so.
"Only Congress can authorize military action under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution."
"To add insult to injury, the Trump Administration has failed to fully explain to Congress and the American people what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the United States that required the strike to take out General Soleimani."
You can watch my remarks on the war powers resolution here.
"Attended Classified Briefing on Iran by Administration Officials  On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire briefed the full House of Representatives in a classified setting on Iran."
"Members asked tough questions, but the Administration failed to share any actionable intelligence that the attack was based on."
"Specifically, they could not answer what the imminent threat was that compelled them to undertake the strike."
"Hearing on Improving Health Care Coverage and Outcomes    As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine seven bills to improve health outcomes for kids and strengthen benefits and coverage for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries."
We examined:   Legislation to extend Medicare coverage of post-transplant drugs for kidney transplant recipients.
"Currently, Medicare only covers necessary drugs to prevent kidney failure for 36 months."
This legislation is projected to save 375 kidney transplants a year;   Legislation to provide funding to advance the study and prevention of Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood (SUDC).
"This is the death of a child over the age of 12 months that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation and autopsy;   Legislation to award grants to schools to encourage better allergy and asthma treatment;   Legislation to improve birth outcomes in high-risk communities through increased funding for mothers;   Legislation that requires health plans to cover medically-necessary treatments related to a patients birth defects, congenital disorders, or congenital malformations;   Legislation that updates the Part B enrollment process for the first time in 50 years, protecting Medicare beneficiaries from a lifetime of financial penalties because of a failure to enroll promptly in Part B;   Legislation that requires states to offer a non-emergency medical transportation benefit to Medicaid beneficiaries, ensuring 70 million low-income and disabled individuals have reliable transportation to access the care they need."
This would be a godsend to so many people in our country!

Voted YES on the PFAS Action Act of 2019  Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (referred to as PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals found in many commercial products.
"These chemicals have strong chemical bonds and do not break down easily in the environment, causing them to accumulate in humans and wildlife."
"PFAS have long been linked with adverse health effects including cancer, immune system effects, infertility, impaired child development, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease."
The House passed the PFAS Action Act which requires the cleanup of sites contaminated with PFAS; the monitoring for PFAS in drinking water; and the creation of new standards to limit further human and environmental exposure to PFAS.
"Voted YES on the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020  According to a 2018 North Atlantic Treaty Organizationreport, Huaweis influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations.The House passed the Secure 5G and Beyond Act to require the Administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems."
This strategy must also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies without sacrificing reliable internet access.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act  Aviation currently accounts for approximately three percent of the nations total greenhouse gas emissions, and the emission rates are expected to triple by 2050."
"The Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act bolsters NASAs efforts to reduce emissions from aviation, while also reducing the impact of airplane noise."
"Specifically, this bill:   Establishes a goal of commercial airplanes emitting 50 percent less greenhouse gas and 50 percent less noise compared to 2019 levels by 2030 for regional planes and 2040 for larger, single-aisle planes;   Authorizes NASA to accelerate its work on electrified propulsion systems to achieve noise and emissions reductions;   Challenges NASA to work with industry partners to carry out flight tests by 2025 and to bring new airplanes into service between 2030 and 2040; and   Requires NASA to provide guidance on new technologies to help the FAAs work to ensure the safe and effective deployment of these technologies."
Horse Transportation Safety Act  Transporting horses in double-deck trailers is often dangerous because they do not provide enough headroom for horses to stand upright.
The livestock often endure long journeys in cramped positions and sustain serious injuries as a result.
"To address this problem, the bipartisan Horse Transportation Safety Act prohibits the transportation of horses in interstate commerce in a motor vehicle containing two or more levels stacked on top of one another."
"Weekly Highlights  Congressional App Challenge Winner   It was a pleasure to visit Saratoga High School to announce the winner of the 2019 Congressional App Challenge for Californias 18th Congressional District, Sidney Hough."
"Sidneys app, Uproot, prevents heavy crop losses by identifying invasive plants."
"Using machine learning and artificial intelligence, Uproot analyzes photos of plants in real-time to detect growth that is harmful to crops."
"Congratulations to Sidney, and bravo to the 16 Challenge participants for pursuing innovative technology to create meaningful change."
"I co-chair the Congressional Internet Caucus, which hosts the Congressional App Challenge."
"The Challenge is a bipartisan, nationwide competition and is comprised of high school students from all participating congressional districts that compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or app, for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice."
"The competition is designed to promote innovation and engagement in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education fields."
Students can learn more about the annual Congressional App Challenge here.
"In the Words of My Constituents  Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies."
"In this new year, over 2,500 constituents have already contacted me."
I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me.
"This week, 1,289 constituents contacted our office about issues including:   209 constituents wrote to me about the military strike in Iran   187 constituents wrote to me in support of thePFAS Action Act   156 constituents wrote to me about impeachment  Annas Recommended Reading and Watching  Frequently, I read articles or see videos that I think my constituents would benefit from."
"San Francisco Chronicle Editorial (12/26/2019)  Editorial: At last, Congress takes action against those annoying robocalls  The Chronicle Editorial Board applauded Congress passage of the TRACED Act to stop the incessant scourge of robocalls we all receive."
The bill was signed into law on December 30th.
Ive advocated for over a decade to protect the public from unwanted calls and Im thrilled we passed this law to bring relief to the American people.
New York Times Opinion (1/8/2019)  Trump Has a Bizarre Idea of Winning  Nicholas Kristof lists several of the grave consequences that resulted from the Presidents strike against Iran.
"     News from Representative Steve Womack          HOME  ABOUT STEVE  SERVICES  3RD DISTRICT  ISSUES  LEGISLATION  NEWSROOM       January 3, 2020    WEEK IN REVIEW I hope you all had a Happy New Year!"
"To start off 2020, I had the opportunity to meet with some of the best and brightest students from Arkansas's Third District."
It was my privilege to honor the winners of the latest Congressional App Challenge!
"Thisannual and nationwide coding competition for middle school and high school students aims to encourage our nations youth to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education and computer science careers."
"We received many incredible and novel applications from amazing students across AR-3, and I am pleased to announce that the 2019 winners are: Julian Sanker, an 11thgrader at Haas Hall Academy (Fayetteville), and Lucas Kellar, a 10thgrader at the Don Tyson School of Innovation (Springdale)."
"Julian and Lucass winning app,Crime Map, uses publicly available crime and emergency data to populate an interactive and real-time map."
Residents can search the map to see 911 dispatches in the area and learn of emergency situations and danger in their community.
The application also features custom icons that illustrate the nature of the call and allows users to filter the data by different categories.
Crime Mapwill now be featured on a digital display in the U.S. Capitol and on the Congressional App Challenge website!
More information about the winning app can be foundhere.
"Today, I presented these students with certificates and medallions to recognize their work."
"A video that highlighted their app was played during the ceremony, and I was impressed by the application, its functionality, and the tech skills of these students."
"I was also pleased thatlocal technology professionals from Startup Junkie, Dr. Martin Schoppmeyer (Haas Hall Academy Superintendent), Dr. Jim Rollins (Springdale Public School District Superintendent), and othersfrom the community were able to attend."
"Our students are the next generation of innovators, and its great to see them leverage their skills both inside and outside the classroom."
"I congratulate Julian and Lucas on this impressive accomplishment, which characterizes the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit that has inspired Arkansans for generations."
"This competition continually showcases the brilliant young minds of the Third District, and I look forward to seeing where their coding capabilities lead them in the future."
"This is the fifth year that I have hosted the Congressional App Challenge in Arkansass Third Congressional District, and I look forward to hosting the competition again in 2020!"
"I'm proud of all of the participants, and I hope their work will inspire other gifted students in our district to pursue STEM education and computer science careers!"
The safety and security of America at home and abroad is a critical priority.
"As you might have seen on the news, Qassem Soleimani, a leader of Iran's Quds Force, terrorist, and enemy of peace is confirmed dead."
The Presidents decisive action made it clear that the U.S. will not tolerate escalating threats and aggression.Soleimani was a dangerous enemy whose goal was evil and chaos.
"He was directly involved in the deaths of American soldiers and innocent civilians, and his reign of terror was rightfully ended."
"As a veteran, I recognize the importance of peace through strength.Iran was given multiple warnings  but chose to continue its belligerent behavior and threaten U.S. troops and diplomats."
"Justice was served, and Im extremely grateful for our troops and members of the Intelligence Community who completed this mission."
I then headed to Concordia Retirement in Bella Vista to share a cup of coffee and conversation with some great Arkansans.
"We talked about a variety of topics, including Social Security, Medicare, what is happening with Iran, trade, and the deficit."
"I also shared some of my priorities in Congress: a strong defense, lower taxes, secure borders, and continued economic growth."
Its important that I hear directly from the people I represent!
"I thank them for the invite, warm welcome, and great discussion."
"Next week, Congress will be back in session.Remember to keep an eye on myor check out myandpages to stay up-to-date with the latest news."
Wishing Arkansass Third District a great weekend!
"                        CONTACT  MEDIA                Dear Friend, With Christmas just a couple days away, I wanted to take a minute to wish you and yours a very Merry Christmas."
"And to my Jewish constituents, Happy Hanukkah and may the Festival of Lights bring blessings upon you and your families."
"For those of you traveling this holiday season, please stay safe and enjoy this special time with friends and family."
Last week wrapped up a busy stretch in Washington as Congress prepared to break for the holidays.
"After months of time wasted on partisan political theater, House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump."
"The only bipartisan aspect of the entire impeachment process was the votes in opposition, as several Democrats voted with my Republican colleagues and me against impeaching the President."
"Unfortunately, it was only a matter of minutes before the double-talk began."
"In yet another shameful display of what the American people absolutely despise about Washington, after representing to the American people that it was an urgent matter of national security to impeach the President, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are now delaying sending the articles to the Senate while they attempt to rig another unfair process."
The House also considered and passed two separate packages to keep the government funded.
"The first package contained four appropriations bills: Defense, Homeland Security, Financial Services-General Government, and Commerce-Justice-Science."
"The second package contained eight appropriations bills: Agriculture-FDA, Labor-HHS-Education, Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, State-Foreign Operations, Transportation-HUD, Military Construction-VA, and Legislative Branch."
"While much more needs to be done to restrain spending and address our debt, there are a few provisions from these packages I am pleased to highlight."
"In the first package, we not only provided funding for the border wall, we were successful in removing geographic restrictions on its construction."
We provided our brave men and women in uniform with a much deserved 3.1% pay raise while continuing to prioritize rebuilding our military after years of neglect by the Obama Administration.
And we shut down attempts by the Democrats to weaken pro-life protections.
"The House also passed the Conference Report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20 NDAA), which sets policy for the Department of Defense, authorizes funding for its programs, strengthens our national security and supports our men and women in uniform."
"Of particular note was the inclusion of one of President Trumps chief priorities, the creation of the Space Force, which will be the sixth branch of the military."
"Lastly, the House passed President Trumps United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is a massive win for American workers and our economy."
Continue reading for more information on the USMCA and impeachment sham.
"United States Mexico Canada Agreement Passes the House Last week, the House passed the USMCA which is a major win for our economy."
"Americas workers, farmers, and manufacturers will be buoyed by this agreement as it will add 176,000 new American jobs and bring in over $68 billion in new economic activity."
This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation.
"By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive."
"Impeachment Sham Despite any evidence of a crime committed by the President, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have rushed this partisan impeachment sham in an attempt to overturn the 2016 election.By operating in secret, disregarding facts and evidence, and instructing witnesses not to answer Republican questions, this absurd abuse of power by Democrats has failed to reveal an impeachable offense and certainly has come nowhere close to the threshold necessary for impeachment."
Speaker Pelosi directly contradicted her previous statements that impeachment must have bipartisan support and the only bipartisan votes taken were the votes against impeachment.

"                                              Dear Lindsey,  Senator Tammy Baldwin has voted for the final version of the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 that includes a number of measures that deliver results for Wisconsin."
The final version of this defense funding bill now heads to the Presidents desk for his signature.
"I voted in favor of this bipartisan defense authorization legislation because it makes important investments to strengthen our national security and support our service members and their families,said Senator Baldwin.In particular, I am pleased the final bill includes a pay raise for our troops and gets rid of the widows tax."
"It makes sure that federal Small Shipyard grants support American workers and businesses, and authorizes funding for a number of projects important to Wisconsins military personnel and our Made in Wisconsin economy."
Supporting Service Members and Military Families  The bill includes a 3.1% pay raise for service members and eliminates the military widows tax.
"Senator Baldwin is a cosponsor of the bipartisan Widows Tax Elimination Act that was included in theNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA) to repeal the law that prevents as many as 65,000 surviving military spouses nationwide from receiving full Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs survivor benefits."
Strengthening Buy America Standards for Small Shipyard Grants Program  Senator Baldwins bipartisan legislation to strengthen Buy America requirements for federal Small Shipyard Grant funding was included in the final NDAA.
"The measure will support American businesses, manufacturers and workers."
"While Buy American requirements already apply to the Small Shipyard Grant Program, there is a loophole in the Maritime Administrations rules that allow these federal grants to be used to purchase foreign-made equipment."
"Baldwins provision in NDAA will close this loophole to support American businesses and workers like Marine Travelift in Sturgeon Bay, which employs nearly 200 workers and uses Wisconsin-sourced materials to manufacture boat handling equipment that is exported around the world."
Reinforcing Navy Shipbuilding in Wisconsin  The bill includes more than $1 billion in initial funding for the Navys Future Frigate.
"Fincantieri Marinette Marine is competing to build this future ship in Wisconsin, which will continue to support Senator Baldwins priority of expanding good-paying Made in Wisconsin shipbuilding jobs."
"The final defense funding bill also included Baldwins amendment to require certain Navy ships to be built using domestic diesel engines, like those produced by Fairbanks Morse Engine in Beloit."
"Additionally, the bill includes Baldwins bipartisan amendment to direct the Navy to examine how it can bring more Navy maintenance work to Great Lakes shipyards."
"Protecting Workers against Chinas Attempts to Undermine American Industries  Senator Baldwin, along with Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), secured their amendment in the final NDAA to prevent federal funds from being used by transit agencies to purchase rail cars or buses manufactured by Chinese state-owned, controlled, or subsidized companies."
"The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States economy, including rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing."
This amendment would prevent federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese rail assets and ensure transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan to protect American industries and national security.
Boosting Wisconsin Manufacturers  The final NDAA includes an increase of $130 million for Oshkosh Defenses Tactical Wheeled Vehicles.
"Investing in Hi-Tech Careers in the Chippewa Valley  Senator Baldwin secured an amendment requiring a plan from the Department of Defense to leverage commercial supercomputing for defense, allowing the U.S. and Wisconsin to continue advancing American leadership in supercomputing, provide critical technology to our most difficult research and computational questions, and accelerate the deployment of new computer technology."
Cray Computing in Chippewa Falls has been building the worlds leading supercomputers for decades and will be competing to develop and build the next generation of supercomputers.
"To compete with countries like China, the Department of Defense must begin taking advantage of the innovation, science, research and technology presented by the commercial sector."

Statement Regarding Articles of Impeachment Advanced by the House Judiciary CommitteeDemocrats have been trying to overturn the results of President Trumps election and delegitimize his presidency for three years.
The impeachment hearings led by House Democrats have been purely partisan and the entire process has been flawed.
I do not support the articles of impeachment advanced by the House Judiciary Committee.
"Should these articles of impeachment be sent from the House, President Trump will finally have a fair trial in the Senate."
"Under the Constitution, the role of a Senator is to act as a juror."
"Therefore, unless and until the House impeaches President Trump, and the Senate has concluded its review of the impeachment charges, it is inappropriate for me to say how I would vote."
But Ive seen no evidence that President Trump should be removed from office.
"Encouraging U.S. Competitiveness As co-chair and founder of the Senate Competitiveness Caucus, I was pleased tojointhe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) and the Brookings Institute to discuss their newly-released report The Case for Growth Centers: How to Spread Tech Innovation Across America."
"The findings show that from 2005 to 2017, 90 percent of the nations innovation sector growth occurred in only five metropolitan areas, all of which are located on the coasts."
"This type of concentration does not allow us to capitalize on the potential of all regions, including Kansas."
"I founded the Competitiveness Caucus with the core focus of generating awareness on issues pertinent to U.S. economic growth, and what it means for our national security, prosperity and role as a worldwide economic leader."
"As the global economy continues to become increasingly integrated and automated, it will take our entire nation to maintain the United States position as an innovative leader."
"By removing federal barriers and providing targeted federal resources, we can foster an environment where innovation can flourish and cement Americas role as a global economic power."
Thank you to the ITIF and Brookings for their work to examine this issue.
I remain committed to working with them and my Senate colleagues to do more to expand these growth centers across the country.
"Recognizing Major Kelly McManusOn Wednesday, Ispokeon the floor in tribute of my Congressional Army Fellow, Major Kelly McManus."
"Over the past year, she has worked to serve Kansans, service-members and veterans in my Washington, D.C. office demonstrating her leadership and professionalism."
"After spending time in our state and having personal conversations with Kansans, she led efforts to secure maternity leave for those serving in the National Guard and Reserve and sought to increase access to suicide prevention programs and destigmatize the notions surrounding mental illness."
"A testament to her leadership over this past year was her promotion to Major in July, which I had the honor and privilege of attending and participating in."
"Kelly has had an outstanding career in the Army over the past ten years, deploying abroad and serving stateside, and I look forward to following her future accomplishments in service to our nation."
"Sending a Holiday Card to our Troops This week, I stopped by the American Red Cross Holiday Mail for Heroes event to write a card for a service-member serving overseas during the holiday season."
"The holiday season provides a time for us to show our appreciation for others, and there is no one we should appreciate more than the men and women serving our country."
"Thank you to all our brave service members, and their families, for your sacrifice while spending time away from loved ones this holiday season."
"Applauding Agreements Reached on Trade I have long advocated for movement on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and I applaud the White House and Congress for reaching an agreement this week and advancing this deal."
"Canada and Mexico are Kansas top two export markets, and over the last two years, I have heard directly from Kansans how vital a modern trade deal like USMCA would be for our farmers, ranchers and manufacturers to compete and succeed in the 21st Century economy."
"Now is the time to get USMCA across the finish line, and I urge the House to quickly bring USMCA up for a vote."
President Trump also announced a Phase One trade deal with China.
"I have advocated for an agreement that addresses Chinas bad behavior on trade, while restoring markets for American products, especially agricultural goods."
"According to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the agreement will address much of Chinas misbehavior on trade, including intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer."
"China also agreed to purchase $200 billion in additional goods from the United States, including $40-$50 billion in agricultural products annually for the next two years."
"In return, the U.S. has indefinitely suspended enacting additional rounds of tariffs on imports from China and lowered certain tariffs currently in effect."
"While I look forward to reviewing the details of the agreement, this appears to be a positive step toward reducing trade tension and expanding market access to China."
"AdvancingLegislation  National Suicide Hotline Designation Act On Wednesday, the National Suicide Hotline Designation Actpassed out of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and is now up for consideration by the full Senate."
"I am a sponsor of this legislation that would provide increased and expedited mental health support to those who need it by designating 9-8-8 as the number dedicated solely to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, similar to 9-1-1."
"According to a 2017 report by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) suicide was the tenth leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of 47,000 people that year."
This tragic public health pattern is more prominent in particularly vulnerable populations like that of our veterans community.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recent National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report indicated that the suicide rate for veterans in 2017 was 1.5 times the rate for non-veteran adults.
"While Americans currently have access to a ten-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a report produced by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), VA and others found the designation of a three-digit hotline, specifically 9-8-8, dedicated solely to national suicide prevention and mental health crisis management would significantly increase Americans access to potentially life-saving services."
"As a member of both the Senate Veterans Affairs and Commerce Committees, I remain committed to ensuring veterans and all Americans have timely access to professional-level resources for suicide prevention and mental health."
"The CONTRACT Act Also during Wednesday's Senate Commerce Committee meeting, I was pleased theContinuity for Operators with Necessary Training Required for ATC Contract Towers (CONTRACT) Act, passed out of committee."
I am an original cosponsor of this legislation which supports our aviation industry by removing an unnecessary barrier in the hiring pipeline for air traffic control facilities participating in the FAAs Federal Contract Tower (FCT) program.
"With 256 air traffic control towers currently participating in the FCT program, including eight located in Kansas, these towers are imperative to managing the safety and efficiency of our nations complex airspace and are often staffed by retired FAA controllers."
"Due to changes in the Federal Employees Retirement System, retired FAA air traffic control specialists face an offset penalty that subtracts from their retirement payments when they earn more than a set amount annually."
"Given that FAA controllers face mandatory retirement at age 56, these experienced controllers should not have to choose between continuing to use their skills at a contract tower or the retirement benefits they earned."
I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue and further supporting our nations contract towers.
"The FIRST Act On Thursday, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced my bill, theFIRST Act, to be considered by the full Senate."
"TheFIRST Actwould allow the names of fallen First Infantry Division soldiers who were killed in Operations Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn, and Enduring Freedom to be added to the First Infantry Division Monument located on the grounds of the White House."
"This monument currently honors the service, dedication, and ultimate sacrifice of each individual soldier who was Killed in Action while serving in the Big Red One during World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and Desert Storm."
"It is imperative that we continue to honor the service and sacrifice of our First Infantry Division soldiers, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to send this bill to the Presidents desk."
Confirming the Director of U.S.
"Fish and Wildlife Services On Thursday, the Senate confirmed Aurelia Skipwith to be the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)."
Director Skipwith is an effective leader and recognizes the value of working with local stakeholders to find sensible solutions.
"InOctoberof this year, I met with Director Skipwith in her previous capacity as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks at the Department of the Interior to discuss the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge water rights dispute."
I explained the need for farmers and ranchers to be able to utilize groundwater in the basin and the importance of agriculture to the rural economy.
"In the meeting, Director Skipwith committed to working with local stakeholders to find a voluntary solution to the dispute, and the first meeting between FWS and stakeholders in Kansas has taken place since then."
"I am pleased the Senate voted to confirm her, and I look forward to continuing to work with her and Kansans to find a resolution to the Quivira water rights dispute."
"Ambassador to Russia On Thursday, the Senate overwhelmingly approved John Sullivan to be our nations new ambassador to Russia."
"This important position has been vacant for two months, and I am pleased the Senate moved quickly to fill it."
"Russia remains a key threat to the United States, and it is essential to have a diplomat in place to defend American interests and explore, if possible, ways to improve the relationship."
"Sullivan pledged resolute opposition where Russia undermines American interests, including threatening election security."
I am confident Ambassador Sullivan will serve the United States well in Moscow.
"Discussing Flood Corp PoolsOn Friday, I hosted a meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City District (USACE KC), Kansas Farm Service Agency (KFS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRSC), Risk Management Agency and Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWPT) to discuss the Tuttle Creek Reservoir and the impact of the 2019 flooding within the area."
This was an opportunity to explore solutions for those negatively impacted by flooding north of the reservoir and to hear from the agencies with a role in providing financial relief and resiliency measures in response to flooding events.
"I want to thank the farmers and landowners who joined the meeting to share their stories and how their operations have been affected, as well as the agency representatives USACE KC District Commander Col. William Hannan, KSF Executive Director David Schemm, USDA NRSC State Conservationist Karen Woodrich,Risk Management Agency Regional Office Director Collin Olsen, and KDWPT Secretary Brad Loveless for attending."
"Touring Goodyear Tire and Rubber CompanyOn Friday, I toured the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company commercial manufacturing plant in Topeka."
"This site was originally constructed in 1944 as part of a federal government program during World War II, and then purchased the next year by Goodyear."
"The plant will soon be celebrating its 75thAnniversary, demonstrating the long commitment Goodyear has made to employment in Kansas."
"During the tour, I was able to see the manufacturing process and learn about the strong partnership they have with the Topeka Chamber, who also joined us for the tour."
"Thank you to Brian Riley and Nathan Facey for hosting the tour and Matt Pivarnik, Curtis Sneden, and Molly Howey from the Topeka Chamber for joining."
"Honored to Serve You in Washington It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C."

"As Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats continue their partisan impeachment sham, they have now introducedArticles of Impeachment."
"Even though they don't have the evidence and have orchestrated an unfair process, they have put the goals of their far-left wing base ahead of their responsibility to serving the country."
"On another note, after a year of dragging her feet, Pelosi has agreed to President Trump's United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."
The House has also considered the Conference Report for the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act in order to fund our national defense and give our men and women in uniform the resources they deserve.
"United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement After the Democrat majority held off a floor vote for months while playing politics, Speaker Pelosi has finally agreed to President Trump's trade deal and will bring the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to the House floor for a vote."
As a member of the committee that handles trade  the House Ways and Means Committee  it has been an honor to work with Ranking Member Kevin Brady and other Committee members to support the efforts of President Trump and the administration to renegotiate NAFTA.
This is clearly a better deal for American businesses and workers.
This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation.
"By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive."
"After years of sluggish recovery, our economy is booming again and growing 50 percent faster than projected."
"America is once again the most competitive place in the world to do business and thanks to the hard work of President Trump, the USMCA will help continue that growth."
"I was proud to be the conservative voice in the room at the White House to emphasize the trade priorities of my neighbors in the Third District, and again in Ottawa with Ways and Means Committee members to voice the importance of this trade agreement."
"As Chief Deputy Whip, I will have the honor of working alongside Republican Whip Steve Scalise to deliver a big vote in support of President Trumps trade deal."

"         `                  Home  About  Newsroom  At Your Service  Representing Hawaiis Values  Contact                        December 11, 2019    Aloha,    I am pleased to share that several things we've been working on are expected to be signed into law."
"Four of our billswere included in this year's National Defense Authorization Act, a bipartisan must-pass piece of legislation."
"These provisions will provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave to federal workers, protect military bases from extreme weather events, improve the emergency alert system, and help crack down on child pornography."
Hawaii will also receive $26 million in new federal disaster relief funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"This brings the total federal disaster relief funding for recovery from the 2018 storms, Hurricane Lane, and the Kilauea eruptions to more than half a billion dollars."
"As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawaii if there is anything we can do."
"Mahalo,    Brian Schatz  United States Senator                Schatz Legislation Expected to Become Law Several pieces of legislation authored by Senator Schatz are set to become law after being included in the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)."
The legislation was introduced as individual bills and incorporated into the bipartisan NDAA package.
"The four provisions are:  Providing Paid Parental Leave for Federal Workers  This bill provides twomillion federal workers with 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child after birth, adoption, or the initiation of foster care."
"Although the current Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care of a new child, it does not provide any paid leave."
Studies have shown that providing paid leave for federal employees would save the government at least $50 million annually in turnover and replacement costs.
Federal agencies are already struggling to recruit and retain young talent.
"Just 6 percent of the federal workforce is under the age of 30, while roughly 40 percent of the workforce is eligible to retire within the next three years."
"Improving the Emergency Alert System  The Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats (ALERT) Act, which was introduced by Senator Schatz following the false emergency alert that went out across Hawaii in January 2018, will improve the emergency alert system and give the federal government the primary responsibility of alerting the public of a missile threat."
State and local governments have been largely responsible for alerting the public of threats from natural disasters and severe weather.
"With various government agencies issuing alerts, the system has relied on an inconsistent patchwork of technologies and procedures established by each agency."
"The false alarm in Hawaii highlighted some of the weaknesses in the states emergency alert system, which had a poorly designed user interface and did not have a sufficient verification system or computer redundancies to help prevent mistakes."
The incident made clear the need for federal standards in the system and called into question the states responsibility to issue a missile alert.
Protecting Military Bases from Extreme Weather  The Requiring Every American Defense Installation to Nullify Environmental Stresses for Security (READINESS) Act protects military bases from extreme weather events by requiring them to prepare for potential disasters and other risks posed by severe changes in environmental conditions.
"The new law will require that all Department of Defense bases have military installation resilience plans that:   Include the current risks and threats to military resilience resulting from extreme weather events, change in sea level, flooding, and wildfiresand describe the impact on critical infrastructure inside and outside the military base that are necessary to its mission; Include the future risks and threats to military resilience during the 50-year lifespan of the base resulting from extreme weather events and other environmental conditions; Describe the projects necessary to mitigate the identified risks to the military baseincluding the costs and types of agreements with community stakeholders necessary to execute the military installation resilience plan; and Use projections from recognized governmental and scientific entities, such as the National Academies of Sciences, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S."
"Global Change Research Office, to inform future risk assessments."
"Fighting Trafficking of Child Pornography  The End National Defense (END) Network Abuse Act will help the Pentagon stop the unacceptable use of the Defense Departments (DoD) network to view, possess, trade, procure, and even produce child pornography."
"Across the internet, more than 45 million online images and videos of child sexual abuse material were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children."
"In 2018, the DoDs network ranked 19th out of 2,891 networks nationwide when it came to peer-to-peer file trading of child pornography."
Coupled with these troubling statistics is a lack of training and law enforcement tools for the DoD to take on child sexual exploitation.
"The END Network Abuse Act would upgrade the training and technical capacity of military criminal investigative organizations to confront the misuse of the DoDs computers, facilities, and equipment to access and trade child pornography."
"It would also require the DoD to enter into collaborative agreements with appropriate federal, state and local law enforcement entities, child protection organizations, trauma informed health care providers, and targeted social services."
Securing Federal Disaster Relief Funding The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that Hawaii will receive $26 million in new federal disaster relief funding.
"The new Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding adds to the $71 million announced earlier this year, and will help state and local governments rebuild impacted communities, especially in low- and moderate-income areas, and provide resources to help businesses recover."
"Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked with federal agencies and state and county officials to ensure Hawaii submitted a strong application to receive the maximum amount of funding."
The new funding allocation was part of the $1.7 billion housing disaster recovery package Congress passed last year.
"With the $26 million in housing and community development grants announced today, Hawaii has now been allocated more than a half a billion dollars in federal disaster relief funding to help the state recover from the historic storms in April 2018, Hurricane Lane, and the eruption of Kilauea on Hawaii Island including:   $15.3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) inindividual assistance to help people who have lost their home; $205 million from FEMA in public assistance to help local and state governments clean up and repair public infrastructure such as facilities, parks, and water lines; $93.1 million from the Department of Transportation to help rebuild roads and highways; $80 million from the Department of the Interior to help repair damages at the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory and the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge; $71 million from the Department of Housing  Urban Development for housing and community development; $47.2 million from the Small Business Administration in subsidized loans to help individuals and businesses pay for repairs not covered by insurance; $4 million from the Department of Labor in Disaster UnemploymentInsurance to help those who lost their job temporarily or permanently because of a disaster and are not eligible for regular unemployment benefits; and $187,000 from the Economic Development Administration to provide technical assistance for economic development activities in disaster impacted areas."
"The Senate Committee on the Climate Crisis, chaired by Senator Schatz, also held a hearing on how we can help communities rebuild after severe weather."
"To watch the hearing, click here."
"Protecting Our Personal Data Online Senator Schatz, the top Democrat on the Senate Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee, led a group of 16 senators in reintroducing legislation to protect peoples personal data online."
"The Data Care Act would require websites, apps, and other online providers to take responsible steps to safeguard personal information and stop the misuse of users data."
"Doctors, lawyers, and bankers are legally required to exercise special care to protect their clients and not misuse their information."
"While online companies also hold personal and sensitive information about the people they serve, they are not required to protect consumers data."
This leaves users in a vulnerable position: they are expected to understand the information they give to providers and how it is being used  an unreasonable expectation for even the most tech-savvy consumer.
"By establishing an explicit duty for online providers, Americans can trust that their online data is protected and used in a responsible way."
"Senator Schatz also questioned witnesses at a Commerce Committee hearing entitled ""Examining Legislative Proposals to Protect Consumer Data Privacy."""

"                             Following the shooting atthe Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida,Senator Rick Scott visited the Naval Air Station to receive a briefing from local and federal law enforcement and military leaders and thank volunteers from the American Red Cross.Senator Rick Scott also stopped by Baptist Hospital to visit victims and their families."
"Senator Rick Scott released the following statement:  Senator Rick Scott said, I'm extremely concerned by the reports that this shooter was a foreign national training on a U.S. military base in Florida."
"Whether this individual was motivated by radical Islam or was simply mentally unstable, this was an act of terrorism."
It's clear that we need to take steps to ensure that any and all foreign nationalsare scrutinized and vetted extensively before beingembedded with our American men and women in uniform.
Im calling for a full review of the U.S. military programs to train foreign nationals on American soil.
There is no reason we should be providing state-of-the-art military training to people who wish us harm.
"And most importantly, there is no reason to risk the safety and security of our American men and women in uniform."
"If not for the bravery displayed by the military personnel on the ground and local law enforcement, this tragedy could have been much worse."
"We must be vigilant against those who wish our country and our people harm."""
"Also this week, Senator Scott cosponsored:   The Bring Our Heroes Home Act to support the loved ones ofMissing Armed Forces Personnel; and ThePuppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers (PAWS) Actto helpprovide service dogs to veterans with severe post-traumatic stress disorder  See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below."
"Sen. Rick Scott: The Green New Deal is Best Example of Washingtons Waste  This week, Senator Rick Scott releasedan episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money."
See previous Washington Waste Wednesday features HERE.
"This week's episode covers the Green New Deal, a socialist Democrat proposal that would cost as much as $93 trillion and destroy the nations economy."
What socialist Democrats fail to understand is that you dont have to choose between caring about the environment or growing the economy  you can do BOTH.
"Throughout his time as Governor of Florida, Senator Scott made record investments in the environment, which he was able to do because of Floridas booming economy."

"Sen. Rick Scott: UN Cooperation with Communist China is Dangerous  Senator Rick Scott made the below statement following reports that the United Nations standards for facial recognition, video monitoring, and city and vehicle surveillance are being shaped by Chinese tech groups."
"Senator Rick Scott said, By putting Nicolas Maduro on its human rights council, the UN proved that it has no respect for human rights."
"Now, the UN is highlighting its complete disregard for privacy and national security by allowing Communist China to control facial recognition standards."
"Communist China, which is now partnering with Russia in its quest for global dominance, is stealing our personal information and intellectual property to use against us."
The UNs willingness to hand over control of setting privacy standards to Communist China is yet another example of why the United States needs to reconsider our financial support.Read more HERE.
Sen. Rick Scott: International Olympics Committees Cowardly Failure to Stand up for Human Rights  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after receiving a response from the International Olympic Committee to a letter he sent in October.
"In the letter, Senator Scott called on the International Olympic Committee to stand for freedom and urge Communist China to stop violating human rights, or find a new home for the 2022 Olympic Games."
"Senator Rick Scott said, The response I received from the International Olympic Committee is shameful and embarrassing for an organization that prides itself on uniting the world in peaceful competition."
Are they nave enough to think Communist China wants to unite the world?
Secretary of the Communist Party Xi is violating human rights and stealing intellectual property and technology from the United States in an effort to dominate the world  the opposite of unity.
"The Committee claims to be politically neutral, but the fight for human rights transcends politics."
Its sad they cannot see this.
"On top of that, the Committee provided no information on how they will prevent Communist China from stealing personal information and data of athletes and leaders from around the world who come to the Olympics."
"This kind of cowardice is shameful and disappointing, and the world needs to speak out against every organization that refuses to defend freedom and human rights."
"Sen.

"                                       News from Washington and Across West Texas Dear Friend,  As we gathered around the Thanksgiving table last week, I was full of gratitude for the grace of God, a loving family, and the privilege of serving the good people of West Texas."

"Military Family Month  During Military Family Month in November, I highlighted the families of two local military heroes at Dyess Air Force Base.At the change of command ceremony earlier this year, outgoing Base Commander Col. Brandon Parker had a surprise for his family."
"As a reward for always being strong and rolling with the punches that come with being a military family that moves every few years to new places, he announced that he's taking them to Disney World - a well deserved treat!"
"Filling his shoes, Dyess new Base Commander Col. Ed Sumangil is excited to be back in Abilene, where he was married and two of his children were born."
"Every month, we're grateful for the spouses, children, and loved ones who serve alongside our troops."
"Passing USMCA, Delivering A Win For America  The new and much-improved North American trade deal, USMCA, is being held up by House Democrat leadership who are more concerned with playing political games than adding over 176,000 new jobs and $70 billion to our nation's economy."
"Despite the assurances they have been provided to address concerns about enforcing labor and environmental standards, Democrats are continuing to move the goal posts and put partisan politics over prosperity as they delay passage of USMCA to focus on their impeachment inquisition of President Trump."
"Click here or on the image below to watch my conversation on Fox Business Network about the prospects of passing USMCA before the end of 2019:    Standing Up For West Texas Beef Producers  When I'm home in West Texas, the cows tell me how bad the Green New Deal is."

That's why I introduced the Accountable Care In Rural America Act before the Thanksgiving holiday to change the incentives of our health care system to reward quality over quantity while reducing the cost to taxpayers over time.
"I am confident that this bill will empower rural health care providers, reduce costs to both patients and taxpayers, and strengthen the health and well-being of our families living in America's breadbasket and energy basis."

"                                       News from Washington and Across West Texas Dear Friend,  Last Sunday morning, the American people woke up to news that we had all longed to hear: that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS and the worlds number one terrorist, had been brought to justice by our brave American service members."
"The death of this depraved individual is a huge win for America and all the civilized world, and it sends a clear message to those that would use terrorism to pursue their evil ends that they cannot escape the long and mighty arm of the United States military."
I thank our President for his decisive leadership in ordering this raid and our special operatives for their courage and bravery in undertaking this extremely dangerous operation.
"Tricking the American People From Day 1 of Donald Trump's presidency, House Democrats have tried dressing up their impeachment inquisition as a legitimate inquiry instead of what it really is: a purely political ploy aimed at discrediting and destroying our duly-elected President."
"Thats why it is only fitting on Halloween, Democrats tried to put a costume of credibility to disguise their political witch hunt of Donald J. Trump and distract from their radical, socialist policies  which should scare all Americans."
House Democrats relentless pursuit of this impeachment scam is hurting our ability to get things done on behalf of the American people like passing USMCA and passing legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
"In fact, this Congress, Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have had bills signed into law."
"Its past time for Speaker Pelosis political theater to exit stage left so we can get back to doing our jobs, debating the real issues, and solving real problems."
Bringing the Prescription Drug Pricing Process Out of the Darkness All Americans are rightly concerned about the ever-rising costs of prescription drugs.
One of the reasons why drug costs have spiraled out of control is because discounts negotiated by the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) the middle-men in the drug supply chain  are shrouded in secrecy.
"Americans are left in the dark about the rebates these PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers, and while we have no idea where the rebate value is going, we know where its not going  to our seniors at the point of sale."
"To that end, Im proud this week the House passed bipartisan legislation I led that provides more transparency in an otherwise opaque process that will help ensure rebates go towards reducing the cost of drugs for seniors."
"This legislation also includes the text of my bill, the Shop Rx Act, which requires drug plans for seniors to offer real-time information regarding the various options of drugs and their associated costs."
"By providing seniors with access to the readily available, relevant information they need in order to be real consumers in the healthcare market, we will empower them with the knowledge to choose the options that best fit their needs and their budget."
"And because consumers will have more information, they will have more choices and insurers will have to actually compete for their business, which will ultimately bring down the cost of drugs- something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on."
Click here or on the image below to watch my remarks from the floor in support of my legislation.
"Ushering in American Energy Dominance At the heart of Americas economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy."
"American energy independence is undoubtedly a matter of national security, but it's also a question of life  death for our rural communities."
"In West Texas, energy producers are as crucial to our communities as our educators, healthcare providers,  ag producers."
"Click here to watch my remarks opposing HR 2181, Democrat-led legislation that would ban future mineral development in an area outside the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which would put a choke-hold on energy production by our New Mexico neighbors and members of the Navajo Nation tribe."
"Jobs, Jobs, Jobs We continue to see more great news come out about our economy, which was once again confirmed with the latest jobs report."
"Octobers numbers showed the economy added 128,000 jobs last month, exceeding economists expectations."
This is just goes to show that President Trump and Republicans pro-growth policies have brought greater freedom in the marketplace are helping Americans keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets where it belongs.
"Now its time to keep our foot on the pedal by passing USMCA and ushering in the 176,000 new jobs that this better, fairer trade deal will deliver."
"Hometown Hero Earlier this week, Lubbock Police Department Officer Thomas Thompson, a finalist for the Police Officer of the Year Award, was honored by President Trump at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in Chicago."

A summary of the legislation can be found here.
"In a speech on the Senate Floor, Senator Romney spoke about how it's irresponsible for Congress to keep ignoring a preventable crisis."
The TRUST Act would put in place a responsible process now to prevent dramatic cuts to programs or massive tax hikes down the road.
"The TRUST Act is also sponsored by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Todd Young (R-IN), Doug Jones (D-AL), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)."
Senators Romney and Manchin spoke to CNBC's Squawk Box about their legislation to rescue federal trusts funds.

Sen. Rick Scott on Senate Floor: Lets Work Together to Lower the Cost of Healthcare for Americans  Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate Floor about the Democrats latest attempt to prevent states from having any flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens.
Senator Scott is working on real solutions to lower the cost of healthcare for Americans.
Read excerpts of Senator Scotts remarks as prepared for delivery below or his full speech HERE.
What weve heard this week from my Democrat colleagues on healthcare is just more of the same.
"More fear-mongering, more misinformation."
The issue this week is whats called 1332 Waivers.
These waivers allow states flexibility in how they implement healthcare programs.
Its a simple concept.
Every state is different.
Every state should have the flexibility to design their healthcare programs and regulations in a way that best fits the needs of their citizens.
"But heres the problemthe Democrats dont believe in states rights, or allowing state taxpayers and citizens ANY flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens."
"The Democrats want these top-down, one-size-fits-all federal programs."
"If there is choice and flexibility, they want to restrict it."
"Its how big government works, and the Democrats love big government, restrictive mandates, and socialism."
"We need to reduce healthcare costs and provide a safety net for those who cannot afford their healthcare, not create a federal government-organized healthcare market, which causes healthcare costs to skyrocket."
Giving flexibility to the states is an easy way to increase access and quality of care for the American people.
Enough with the misrepresentations.
Enough with the nonsense.
Enough with the fear mongering.
The American people deserve better.
"Lets work together to lower the costs of healthcare, so all taxpayers can get the care they need at a price they can afford."
Sen. Rick Scott: We Need to Fight for the Values that Made America Great  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner to share his personal story and priorities as a United States Senator.
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote,  Even though my Mom had no money, she was optimistic and hopeful."
"She told us we were blessed because God and our founders created the greatest country ever, where anything was possible."
"While I didnt always appreciate my tough-love, my-way-or-the-highway Mom growing up, I now thank God every day for my Mom and this country."
She gave me the opportunity to experience every lesson this country had to offer before I was 20.
"Unfortunately, the left has worked hard over the last 50 years to discredit the values of the America I was raised with and the values of the America I want my grandsons to grow up with."
"We all acknowledge that Americans, our country, and our institutions have flaws, but the left has worked to discredit our founders, our institutions, our churches, our law enforcement, our morals, and almost everything my mom taught me."
"The values that I grew up with, the ones my tough-love mom taught me, are becoming a way of the past."
"But I believe these values, these virtues, can and should be part of our countrys future."
"In the meantime, let's fight for the country I was raised in because that is the country our children and grandchildren deserve."

Healthy Outcomes Start Now A Policy Forum on Prevention in Bangor    Often lost in the debates about whoshould pay for healthcare is how much we pay for healthcare  and its just too much.
"Americans pay the highest per capita costs for healthcare, but our health outcomes dont reflect that."
"We need to fix that, and we can start by motivating people towards healthier lifestyles."
"In mid-October, I held a discussion on prevention in Bangor with local healthcare providers and public wellness experts on the best ways to use prevention strategies to improve health outcomes and reduce costs."
"The cheapest medical procedure is the one that doesnt need to happen  we should figure out ways to prevent issues before they get serious.The voices at our event in Bangor had important ideas on how to find solutions that will improve both our health and our wallets, and I'm bringing their insights back to Washington as I push to make prevention a healthcare priority."

"Thoughts from Senator King Congress Must Follow the Facts in Impeachment Inquiry  This column appeared in the Portland Press Heraldand the Bangor Daily Newson October 8th, 2019    We are in the midst of a difficult and dangerous period."
"Over the past two years, I have been a conservative on impeachment; one of my heroes isWilliam Pitt Fessenden,a Maine senator just after the Civil War who cast one of the deciding votes against the impeachment of Andrew Johnson."
"(This vote, which threatened to end Fessendens political career, was featured in John F. Kennedys Profiles in Courage.)"
He believed then (as I do now) that overturning the results of an election should be an absolute last resort and should not be based upon policy or political differences between the Congress and the president.
But when a sitting president admits to using the power of his office to openly solicit the engagement of a foreign government in his re-election campaign (President Zelensky  We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins [anti-tank missiles] from the United States for defense purposes.
"President Trump  I would like you to do us a favor though), its hard to argue that beginning a formal process to get all the facts is unjustified."
"Just in the first week of the House inquiry, more disturbing facts  and new questions  have arisen."
"Texts between administration officials suggest the possibility of a pretty explicit quid pro quo, in fact several."
"Investigation of Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid, for a call with the president, or for a visit to the White House."
"Additionally, the role of the presidents personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr must be examined and clarified."
"And finally, the presidents extraordinary public statement requesting that China investigate the Bidens."
"Such a request to a foreign country with regard to any American citizen would be unusual, but when that American citizen happens to be the son of one of the presidents potential political opponents, the request is less about policy than the personal political interests of the president."
"In fact, this entire matter seems to rest upon this presidents inability to distinguish between the national interest and his own personal interest."
"Only this can explain his continuous characterization of the Zelensky call as perfect, in spite of his repeated requests that Ukraine investigate his political rival as shown in the White House-released summary of the call."
"This also explains his frequent misuse of the word treason, which is defined (in the Constitution itself) as only in levying war against them (the United States), or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
"Criticism of the president, even strong criticism of the president, or a whistleblower reporting possible wrongdoing by the president, is not treason, it is democracy."
"Our entire constitutional system is built upon the principle of checks and balances, expressing in concrete terms the Framers deep concern about the grave dangers of power concentrated in one set of hands."
"The separation of powers, fixed terms of office, vetoes, Senate confirmation of Cabinet and judges, ratification of treaties, the power to declare war and others are all there to ensure that power is shared and that, ultimately, we are protected from those who might abuse the power lent to them by the people."
"And so it is with impeachment, the ultimate check on a public officials betrayal of their trust."
"As a potential juror in an impeachment trial, I will make my final decision only after weighing the facts and evidence established by the process now underway in the House."
"Although I believe that this process may well be politically advantageous to the president, it seems to me that those of us who took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic  at this point have no choice but to follow the facts, wherever they may lead."
"This is a solemn and historic moment, and it cannot be avoided."
"As usual, Abraham Lincoln captured the essence of times like these, Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history."
"We, of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves."
"No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us."
"The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation."

TheStopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Actproposes several steps to stop foreign interference in American elections.

"Advocated to extend funding for community health centers.I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to call for immediate passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act of 2019, which would reauthorize government funding of community health centers for five years."

"Showcasing Wichitas Workforce Capabilities On Thursday, it was great to have Presidential Advisor Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the Air Capital of the World for events at WSU Tech and Textron Aviation."
"During our tour at WSU Tech, we heard from Dr. Sheree Utash on the schools excellent work to equip students with the vital job skills they need to be successful in aircraft manufacturing and related fields."
It was also great to hear from students from WSU Techs Aviation Pathways partnership as they provided insight to Ivanka Trump on how to make certain American workers can remain the best workforce in the world.
"Finally, we joined a number of aviation companies across Wichita, including Spirit AeroSystems, Airbus and Bombardier as they signed the Pledge To Americas Workers."
"A special thanks to President of WSU Tech and member of the Presidents American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, Dr. Sheree Utash for hosting us."
"Later in the morning, Ms. Trump, Secretary Pompeo, Congressman Ron Estes and I joined Wichita aviation stakeholders to tour Textron Aviations production of the Cessna Longitude aircraft."
"During the tour, it was great to meet with employees who have benefited from Textrons Pledge to Americas Workers commitment of 22,240 opportunities."
These Textron opportunities have been realized largely through the Aviation Pathway partnership with WSU Tech for students interested in aircraft manufacturing and emerging aviation technologies of the future.
Thursdays visit is another step in our work to showcase Wichitas outstanding capabilities to the world.
I look forward to continue working with the Trump administration and Kansas stakeholders to bolster both Kansas and American competitiveness.
"Death of ISIS Leader al-Baghdadi Early Sunday morning, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed during a special operations raid in Syria."
"For over five years, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi led ISIS, which terrorized the world with its brutality and extremist ideology."
"I applaud the intelligence community, the U.S. Special Forces and the Administrations leadership in conducting this successful raid."
This is a reminder of the tireless work our servicemembers do every day to keep Americans safe.
We must remain vigilant against ISIS and other extremist threats.
"Working to Make Emergency Services More Accessible for Those Experiencing a Mental Health Crisis On Wednesday, I joined my Senate colleagues in introducing theNational Suicide Hotline Designation Act."
Thisbipartisan legislation would to designate a three-digit phone number for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline and ensure states have the flexibility to strengthen local crisis call centers.
"The current National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis line are 10-digits, which is a barrier to Americans in crisis seeking support."
The state of Kansas and the entire country stand to benefit from increased access to critical suicide prevention and mental health services that a dedicated nationwide hotline would offer.
"I commend the work of my fellow Kansan Chairman Ajit Pai and the entire FCC on this important issue thus far, and I look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the commission and my Senate colleagues to make certain this is an effective tool for those who need it."

"Discussing the Ongoing Situation in Syria with Ambassador James Jeffrey On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations to discuss the situation in Syria with Ambassador James Jeffrey."
"Ambassador Jeffrey, who is the State Departments Special Representative for Syria Engagement and the Special Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, testified to the details involving the decision to withdraw U.S. forces in Syria from the border with Turkey."
"In my questioning, I noted the concern I have heard from Kansans and sought answers on how the U.S. achieves its objectives going forward, including ensuring the protection of Christians and religious minorities."
"This subcommittee is responsible for appropriating funds to aid in protecting these groups and rebuilding areas liberated from ISIS, and I have a strong interest in the Administrations next steps to advance our national interests."

"Speaking on the Senate Floor Regarding Appropriations Process  Each fiscal year, one of the fundamental jobs of Congress is to pass twelve appropriations bills to provide funding for federal agencies and our military."
"On Monday, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the urgency of passing appropriations legislation before government funding expires on November 21."
I reminded my colleagues that it is the role of Congress to make decisions about how federal dollars are spent but far too often Congress has given up this constitutional authority by failing to do its job.
"Currently the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution, meaning that federal funding is effectively on autopilot until appropriations bills are passed, and therefore we as a Congress are failing in our duties to prioritize how money should be spent, or not spent."
"However, I am encouraged by the progress made in the Senate this week."
A legislative package consisting of four FY2020 appropriations bills overwhelmingly cleared a necessary procedural hurdle to begin an open amendment process.
"As an Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, I am pleased that my subcommittees legislation to fund the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as NASA, the National Science Foundation, and many other agencies, was included in the package that also includes appropriations for the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and others."
"While much work on appropriations remains to be done this year  in particular, the need to fund our nations military and provide a pay raise for our men and women in uniform  I look forward to passing these four bills next week and continuing to move appropriations legislation forward in the weeks ahead to prevent a government shutdown."

"Working to Make Public Transportation More Efficient On Tuesday, I was joined by Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) in introducing the Small Community Transit Improvement Act."
This bipartisan legislation would increase the efficiency and capacity of public transportation in some of the nations smaller urban and suburban communities by raising the funds available to the Small Transit Intensive Cities (STIC) Program.
"The STIC Program rewards communities between 50,000 and 200,000 citizen when they match or outperform the average service levels of large cities like New York City."
"Public transportation provides critical services to communities of all sizes, not just major metropolitan areas."
"By building on the successful STIC Program, our sensible legislation would make certain that high-performing public transit systems in smaller urban and suburban communities have the same access to federal resources as their more populous peers."
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to continue developing public transportation opportunities and get this bill across the finish line.

"Meeting with Elizabeth Dole Foundation Fellows  This week, I spoke to members of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to thank them for their selfless service as military caregivers."
"This Foundation, founded by Senator Elizabeth Dole, seeks to advocate and empower the 5 million family caregivers who care for our wounded or ill veterans each and every day."
"Military caregivers have unique, demanding jobs and often have to balance these responsibilities with a full-time job."
"As we look forward to celebrating National Family Caregivers Month in November, it was a pleasure to address this Foundation and thank them for their service to our troops."
"Each military caregiver has a powerful story to share, but I would like to highlight Patti Walkers journey as a caregiver."
Patti is currently a Dole Caregiver Fellow who represents Kansas on the Foundation.
"Pattis husband, Kevin, was gravely injured in Iraq in 2004 and underwent emergency surgery in Baghdad before returning home."
"Although Kevin was able to return stateside, he requires around-the-clock care and attention."
Pattis tireless advocacy for her fellow caregivers while simultaneously providing full-time care for Kevin is a testament to the services that military caregivers provide every day.
It was an honor to hear her story and I am proud to have Patti representing Kansas within the Dole Foundation.
"Spending time with University of Kansas Officials in Washington, D.C."
"This week, I joined University of Kansas (KU) leadership in our nations capital for an event in honor of Chancellor Doug Girod."

"In addition to being an incubator for talent, KU is a top-tier research university with a strong partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), particularly pioneering research in pharmaceuticals, cancer and Alzheimers disease research."
"Id like to thank Chancellor Girod and the rest of the KU leadership for their service to our state, and I look forward to continuing our strong working relationship to ensure KUs success into the future."
"Honoring the OBrate Scholars and Watching K-State Beat Oklahoma On Saturday, ahead of the K-State football game against Oklahoma, I joined Cecil and Frances OBrate, their friends and family, and members of the OBrate Foundation to honor the OBrate Scholars at Kansas State University."

I enjoyed visiting with these outstanding students and hearing about how Cecil and Frances generosity has enabled them to pursue their dreams.

"Ribbon Cutting for 1 Vision Aviations New Salina Hangar On Friday, I was in Salina to celebrate the ribbon-cutting of 1 Vision Aviation in Salina."
"1 Vision Aviation is a provider of aircraft maintenance, repair and modification on a wide range of aircraft."
"The company has ambitious plans for Kansas, as they aim to hire nearly 450 employees within five years of opening their new location in Salina."
"Their new location, in Hangar 1 at Salina Regional Airport, is a mark of progress for the community and demonstrates Kansas continued dominance in the aviation sector."
"During my remarks, I commended the many individuals across Salina who worked tirelessly to bring 1 Vision Aviation to town."
"Celebrating Continued Progress at Junction City High SchoolOn Friday, I was in Junction City to celebrate the beginning of vertical construction on the new Junction City High School (JCHS)."
"During the ceremony, JCHS Principal Melissa Sharp detailed how the new school will impact the entire Junction City community, and noted that when the project is complete, JCHS will finally be able to house all of the high school programs, curriculum and events on one site."
"This milestone marks historic progress for the school and community, and I look forward to being back at JCHS upon the completion of construction."
Thanks to USD 475 Superintendent of Schools Dr. Reginald Eggleston and JCHS Principal Melissa Sharp for their invitation to attend and for all they do to inspire and support students.
"Stafford County Townhall Meeting and an Update on the Quivira NRWOn Friday, I hosted another stop on my Kansas Listening Tour in St. John."
Stafford County is at the center of a dire water dispute surrounding the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).
It was pertinent for me to hear from local producers on how they would be affected by restrictions to their water use.
"Earlier this month, I was able to meet with President Trumps nominee for director of U.S."
"Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Aurelia Skipwith."
"During our meeting, Ms. Skipwith committed that the FWS would work with local stakeholders to find a voluntary solution that satisfies the Quivira water impairment before requesting Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) to move forward with an administrative order to regulate water rights."
"On Friday, the FWS confirmed its intent to not request water in 2020 to settle the impairment while a solution is being negotiated the meets the needs of both the refuge and local stakeholders."
"This announcement provides certainty to farmers, ranchers and the entire regional economy by making clear that next years water use regulations will not go into effect as stakeholders work to find a long term solution to the water impairment."

"News from Representative Kilmer                           BIOGRAPHY SERVICES MEDIA CENTER  CONTACT              October 28, 2019    Hello Folks - Earlier this month, Congress and the American people lost an incredible human being and a tireless public servant in Representative Elijah Cummings."
Elijah worked so hard for his community and to make government work better.
It was an honor to work with him and to consider him a friend.
I think every American should take a few moments to watch the ceremony last week in the United States Capitol celebrating and honoring his life.
"Democrats and Republicans alike spoke of Elijahs unwavering service to the people he proudly represented, his commitment to working together despite political differences to find lasting policy solutions, and his devotion to fighting for whats right to move our country forward."
"Elijah spoke often of the stories of those he was fighting for - of the friends and neighbors he met at community gatherings, his church, and in everyday life."
He brought those stories with him to Congress and fought tirelessly on their behalf.
"His approach served as a reminder to me - and to so many others over the years - to carry the voices of the folks we represent with us to Washington D.C., to vigorously support whats right, but to show kindness, compassion, and civility to one another."
May Elijah rest in peace.
Read on for details for how Ive been bringing those values to Congress.
"Lowering Prescription Drug Costs  Before his passing, Rep. Cummings was a leading voice in the battle to reduce the costs of prescription drugs."
"Across this country, we know that rising drug prices are a huge burden for seniors, hardworking families, and everyone in need."
Our country has seen amazing innovations that have saved lives and reduced suffering.
"But far too often, those innovations are out of reach because people cant afford them."
"In the greatest country on the planet, no one should be forced to have to skip their medications or choose between food and medicine."
Thats why Im excited to report that the House is working on a vitally important bill - H.R.
"3, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act."
"This bill aims to level the playing field for patients, ensuring they have access to less expensive medications."
"Beyond that, the bill is expected to save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars."
"Let me share some details... To ensure that we dont see massive cost hikes and to limit out-of-pocket costs, the bill takes some critical steps."
"Importantly, it requires our government to negotiate prices directly with the drug companies in hopes of driving down prices."
That notion of negotiating isnt a new idea - its a way for government to be more efficient.
Youve seen that drug price negotiation happen within the Veterans Administration.
"Youve even seen negotiation required under Medicare for hospitals, doctors, home health agencies, medical equipment providers, and others."
"But currently, under Medicare, drug companies set their own prices."
"To respond to this, H.R."
3 gives Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies and creates powerful new tools to secure real price reductions.
"It also makes the lower drug prices negotiated by Medicare available to Americans with private insurance, not just Medicare beneficiaries."
"In addition, one of the most common concerns Ive heard from people is a basic frustration that Americans are charged more than folks in other countries for the same drugs."
"Historically, weve been willing to subsidize poorer nations in hopes of reducing preventable deaths and suffering."
"But, theres a real frustration that, under the current system, we are also subsidizing countries like England, France, Germany, Australia, and Japan."
That would end under H.R.
"Beyond that, the bill creates a new, $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries."
Limiting the amount people pay has the potential to save lives and prevent medical bankruptcies.
"Because the bill generates such substantial savings, it enables some of those savings to be reinvested in innovation and the search for new cures and treatments through the National Institutes of Health."
The bill is currently working its way through the committee process (having gone through three committees!).
Im hopeful that well be able to pass this bill in the coming weeks!
"As Ive written previously, the House has passed - and Ive supported - several other bills to try to reduce drug prices."
"Protecting Our Elections  Last week, the House passed the SHIELD Act, a bill I played a lead role in sponsoring to combat interference in American elections."
"This bill closes loopholes that allow foreign spending in our elections, boosts disclosure and transparency requirements, and creates a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign nations or governments."
"As many of you know, Ive visited every nook and cranny of our region."
"And Ive never - ever - heard someone say, You know, we should make it easy for foreign interests to play a role in American elections."
"Rather, in every corner of our region, theres widespread agreement that foreign interests should have no role in our democracy."
Thats not a Democratic notion.
Its not a Republican notion.
Its an American notion.
"Sadly, over the past few years, countless intelligence assessments have confirmed vulnerabilities in the American election system and just this week, one of the worlds most prominent social media companies acknowledged that foreign adversaries like Iran, Russia, and China are already actively working to interfere in our next election."
Thats why the SHIELD Act is so important.
"I was proud to speak on the House floor about the importance of a bill I introduced, the Honest Ads Act, which was included in the SHIELD Act."
"Sponsored by 18 Republicans and 18 Democrats in the House, and by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mark Warner in the Senate, this bill will ensure Americans know who is paying for the online ads they are seeing and make it harder for foreign actors to use the internet to attack our democracy."
I am hopeful that the Senate will take action without delay to further protect our elections.
"Advocating for Paid Family Leave  As most of you know, Im the proud father of two amazing young girls."
"When my oldest, Sophie, was born on April 4, 2006, my life changed forever (for the better!)."
"In those first few weeks, I felt incredibly lucky to work for an employer that said I could take the time I needed to be with my family."
"And while Sophie is now a healthy 13-year-old, those first two years involved a lot of medical appointments."
"Because of paid parental leave, I didnt have to worry about whether my job would be there when I came back."
I didnt need to worry about our familys financial security.
My employer had my back.
"It made me acutely aware of just how critical paid parental leave is, and it made me want to ensure that that my neighbors, friends, and family, have paid family leave too."
"When you welcome a new family member into the world or have to care for an ill family member, you should be able to have some peace of mind."
"Unfortunately, the United States is one of the few countries on the planet that does not have a policy of paid leave for new parents."
"In fact, just 17 percent of working people have paid family leave through their employers to care for a new child or sick family member."
"Im proud to be from Washington state for a number of reasons, but one thing Im particularly proud of is that our state is moving to implement a comprehensive paid family and medical leave plan early next year."
"I believe Congress should move to ensure that no matter where you live, you have access to paid family and medical leave."
"It's important for families, for moms and dads, for children, and for employers who want to retain skilled workers."
Thats why Im a proud sponsor of The FAMILY Act to establish a system of paid family and medical leave here in the United States.
"Research has found that policies like this lead to better family financial stability, a stronger business climate in which more people can participate in the workplace, and a reduction in the use of public assistance programs."
"Last week, I was proud to be a Dad-vocate and speak about how important a comprehensive paid family leave program is for our country."
Ill continue to fight that we make progress on this front.
Working for You  Celebrating Allen AME Church  I enjoyed the opportunity to celebrate two big birthdays at Allen AME Church in Tacoma!

President Trump recently declared October to be National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
This is a great opportunity to review your online habits and make sure you are safeguarding your information.
Here are some tips from the Federal Trade Commission:   Update Your Software: Outdated software is easier for criminals to break into.
Keeping your software up to date helps protect against the latest threats.
"Protect Your Personal Information: When asked for your personal information, think about why this person might need it and whether you can trust their request."
"Protect Your Passwords: Use strong, unpredictable passwords with at least 10 characters."
"Dont use the same password for different accounts, dont share your passwords, and if you write one down, keep it out of plain sight."
"Consider Turning On Two-Factor Authentication: For accounts that support it, two-factor authentication requires both your password and an additional piece of information to log in to your account."
"Give Personal Information Over Encrypted Websites Only: If youre shopping or banking online, stick to sites that use encryption to protect your information as it travels from your computer to their server."
Back Up Your Files: Copy your files to an external hard drive or cloud storage.
"If your computer is attacked by malware, you will still have access to your files."

"The so-called ""impeachment inquiry"" is stumbling ahead."
This week I sent a letter to Chairman Adam Schiff requesting documentsand records related to the work being undertaken by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
"I want Chairman Schiff to explain to the American peoplewhy he has chosen to ignore precedent and bar non-committee members from being present in the committee, even though those members would be voting on whether or not to impeach the President."
This process needs to be opened up.

"                     Home  Our District  About Member                  Dear Friends-  Striving to protect the privacy of all citizens, including small business owners, has been a priority throughout my time in Congress."
"My commitment to protecting privacy, in addition to alleviating regulatory burdens on small businesses, is why I opposed the Corporate Transparency Act (H.R."
"2513), which the House passed on Tuesday."
"Coming from the business world before serving Ohios eighth district, I understand the red tape that business owners face."
Some of my colleagues think its worth forcing business owners to collect and submit more personal information to yet another federal database.
"However, the argument does not hold that creating this burden is necessary due to a handful of criminals using anonymous shell companies to hide their identities and launder money."
Law enforcement already has other means to obtain this information from other databases.
I think Americans privacy is too precious to sacrifice.
"I offered an amendment to solve the problem by other means; and when that failed, I offered a motion to require law enforcement to at least obtain a subpoena before being granted access to such a database."
"Unfortunately, my efforts did not secure enough votes in the House, but I am hopeful that the Senate will fix this misguided bill and protect Americans civil liberties and ensure small businesses are not crushed by yet another federal mandate."
This Week in Financial Services Committee   This week Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg drew much attention at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.
"I had the opportunity to question Mr. Zuckerberg about Facebooks new electronic payments project, Libra."
My concerns with Libra include the amount of influence Facebook would have on developing the currency and how the tech giant plans to protect consumer privacy.
This hearing provided a great opportunity for lawmakers to consider the need for regulatory clarity for blockchain and cryptocurrency.
"My solution, The Token Taxonomy Act (H.R."
"2144), would provide a framework for blockchain startups and established crypto companies alike."
Creating this framework is essential for the growth and development of blockchain technology in the United States.
The SEC still regulates companies from an outdated 1934 framework and does not provide necessary clarity for innovation and growth.
"My goal is to create a standard set of rules and regulations for this emerging industry, paving an avenue for growth and innovation inside the U.S. so that coming generations of Americans will reap the economic benefits of the technology."
"Visiting Upper Valley Medical Center   Lastly, yesterday I had the chance to tour Upper Valley Medical Center in Troy."
"It was gratifying to visit this high-tech medical facility, which offers top-grade medical care for those of us in the eighth district."
UVMC provides many of the resources we need to continue providing the best healthcare possible.
We discussed some of the biggest challenges that healthcare providers face.
Feedback like this is very helpful as Congress considers different approaches to achieve meaningful healthcare reform.

"Congressman Ben McAdams (UT-04) Dear Friend, I had the chance to question Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a House Financial Services Committee hearing."
"As a father of four, I knew just what to talk to him about: child safety online."
"[image = [link 1] Keeping my kids, and your kids safe is a top priority."
The role that online social networks play in the lives of kids causes me stress and keeps me up at night.
"*I wanted to know what more Facebook can do, and should do, to keep kids safe."
* I questioned Mr. Zuckerberg about encrypted messages on the popular WhatsApp that is owned by Facebook.
Encryption is a double-edged sword.
It increases privacy for individual users but makes it difficult to detect child predators targeting children.
"With plans to apply the same encryption to Facebook Messenger, I think there is both cause for concern and an opportunity to find a solution that protects kids."
Facebook was founded with innovation at its core.
*I believe we can have encryption and more secure platforms while still ensuring we protect our children*.
It's important that tech innovators provide both.

"Manufacturing Day is an opportunity for students to get a firsthand look at what todays engineers, technicians and other staff do each day at advanced manufacturing facilities across the region."
"Companies of all sizes opened their doors to provide a close look at their design labs, testing centers and manufacturing operations."
Students heard directly from working professionals about their jobs in manufacturing and what skills are needed to attain them.

"October 18, 2019 Dear Friend, In New Mexico, we know that water is life."
"Particularly in an era of prolonged droughts and climate disruption, we must do all we can to responsibly provide clean water supplies and protect our limited water resources in every corner of our state."
"If we are going to do that, we must use the best available science as our guiding light."
"Earlier this month, I visited some of our state's leading water scientists at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources, located on the campus of New Mexico Tech in Socorro."
Hydrogeologists at the Bureau are mapping our state's aquifers and monitoring the groundwater we all rely on.
"Senator Martin Heinrich meets with Senior Geochronologist Matt Heizler at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources, October 1, 2019."
"During my visit, I met with State Geologist Dr. Nelia Dunbar, Hydrogeology Program Manager Stacy Timmons, and Deputy Director and Associate Director for the Mapping Program Dr. J. Michael Timmons."
"We discussed their latest research findings, which include new details on the complex workings of the aquifer below the Plains of San Agustin."

"As we try to better understand how the climate crisis will affect New Mexico, accurate data and detailed maps of all of our groundwater resources is essential to ensure our water administrators make wise long-term decisions about how to best use and conserve our limited freshwater supplies."
You can count on me to always advocate for scientifically sound and smart investments in New Mexico's water infrastructure.
I hope you can stay in touch with me about this and other issues important to you and your community.
"                                              Dear Lindsey,  To help support veterans who are interested in new careers, Senators Tammy Baldwin and John Hoeven (R-ND) have reintroduced their bipartisan legislation that will make flight-training services available for veterans to become commercial airline pilots."
"Americas veterans have bravely served our nation and we have a shared responsibility to make sure their service and sacrifice is honored, said Senator Baldwin."
Our veterans have also earned every opportunity to be productive and successful after completing their military service.
This legislation increases opportunities for veterans looking to pursue flight training and careers as commercial airline pilots.
We have a real need for qualified pilots and if we make the training more available to veterans we can provide them with a good paying job.
Senator Baldwins bipartisan American Aviator Act will authorize grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support training opportunities for veterans who are not already military pilots.
"Veterans participating in the program will receive flight training necessary to become a commercial pilot and receive other certifications, including to work as a certified flight instructor."
The legislation helps ensure there are enough qualified pilots in the future to continue providing safe and reliable air service to rural airports across the country.
"Senator Baldwin at Fox Valley Tech announcing her bipartisan American Aviator Act on October 11th   Fox Valley Technical College, Air Wisconsin, Appleton Airport, the Air Line Pilots Association and the Regional Airline Association agree Senator Baldwins bipartisan bill takes the right approach and support her American Aviator Act:   TheAmerican Aviator Actprovides veterans with solid high paying jobs while ensuring the viability of air transportation throughout our country and beyond."
"Veterans bring all the right elements to the table,said Dr. Susan May, President of Fox Valley Technical College.Their work ethic, determination, and professionalism make them the perfect candidates to help move our air transportation industry forward."
The aviation industry is in dire need of qualified aircraft pilots.
"TheAmerican Aviator Acttaps into a strong applicant pool of future pilots, who may otherwise not be able to afford financially to get into the industry,said Jared Huss, Chief Instructor and Aeronautics Department Chair at Fox Valley Technical College.This act does two important things; supports our Veterans and supports the stability of our communities air service."
"Fox Valley Tech currently offers flight-training for veterans to become certified airline pilots, and works with Air Wisconsin and Appleton Airport to put more individuals on the path to a successful career as pilots."
Senator Baldwins bipartisan reform would build on this successful model to ensure that more veterans in Wisconsin and across the country could pursue this career path after completing their military service.
Flight-training schools that have established pathways to employment with commercial air carriers are eligible for federal grants to recruit and enroll veterans for flight training.
"Grant funding may be used to provide guidance and flight-training services, including additional training required to reach proficiency."
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Baldwin also successfully secured $1 million in federal funding to support flight-training schools looking to expand and serve more veterans."
"The funding was included in the Fiscal Year 2020 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee in September."
The Appropriations legislation will next go before the full Senate for a vote.
"                             This week,Senator Rick Scott delivered his maiden speech on the Senate Floor to share his personal story and his vision for America.Watch his speech or read excerpts of his remarks as prepared for delivery below."
My story begins with my Mom.
"Even with no money, my mom was always optimistic and hopeful."
"She told us we were blessed because God and our founders created the greatest country ever, where anything was possible."
"Unfortunately, the Left has worked hard over the last fifty years to discredit the values of the America I was raised with  the values of the America I want my grandsons to grow up with."
"We all acknowledge that Americans, our country and our institutions have flaws, but the Left has worked to discredit our founders, our institutions, our churches, our law enforcement, our morals, and almost everything my mom taught me."
I spent most of my life in business.
"The values that my tough-love mom instilled in me helped me achieve the success she expected  not just hoped for, but expected  for me."
I was able to live the American Dream because I worked hard.
"I lived out the values my mom taught me in my business career  hard work and fiscal responsibility, but with a caring spirit to support those around me."
My experience growing up in a family that struggled to get good jobs influenced everything Ive done in my life.
"Its not easy, and it shouldnt be."
"But everyone  every single American  should have that opportunity to struggle, work hard, and overcome the obstacles."
I took those same values to the Governors office when I got elected in 2010.
Florida had been struggling.
"832,000 jobs lost in the four years before I took office."
Home prices cut in half.
The state raised taxes on its poorest citizens by more than $2 billion to fill a budget hole.
I always think about my mom.
"I think about how it impacted her when food prices went up, taxes went up, when my brother got sick without health insurance, and when my dad was laid off."
I became the jobs governor.
"It wasnt a political talking point, it was about real people."
"In eight years, Florida added 1.7 million new jobs, we paid down almost one-third of state debt and invested record funding in education, the environment, and transportation."
"But I also tried to fight for the values that are being lost in this country  I fight to protect life, to support the institution of the family, to lift up our military members, veterans and law enforcement, to promote capitalism and to defend the rule of law and the constitution.In my short time in the U.S. Senate, Ive promoted policies that I believe support the idea of an America where anything is possible."
We need lower taxes and less regulation.
We need a secure border and a sane immigration policy.
We need to get health care costs under control.
We need to defend freedom and liberty around the world.
But none of this will matter unless we see hearts and minds change.
We need a renewal in America of the values that made this country great.
That wont happen on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
"It will happen in living rooms, and classrooms, and churches, synagogues, and board rooms.This challenge is much bigger than politics."
And the solution is not political.
It requires us  every one of us  to stand up and fight.
To say without reservation or fear that we WILL NOT give up on America or the plans of our Founders.
We WILL NOT stop fighting for our future.
"If we want America to be great in the future, we must reject the politically correct attempts to rewrite our history, and we must reject the left-wingattempt to slander the greatness of our ideals."
"America is in fact the greatest country in the history of the world, and we should not be embarrassed to say so  we should proclaim it proudly."
I fear that the values that I grew up with  the ones my tough-love mom taught me  are becoming a way of the past.
"But, I believe these values  these virtues  can and should be part of our countrys future.In the meantime, Ill keep fighting."
I ran for public office to fight for the country I was raised in because that is the country our children and grandchildren deserve.
They deserve what my mom gave me  a free country with unlimited potential for every citizen.
I hope everyone will join me in this fight.

"We cannot accept the repeated failures of the FBI to properly investigate and act on specific tips received about the Parkland shooter, as well as other perpetrators of mass violence in Florida."
"Im proud to stand with the family members of the victims to announce the TIPS Act, which bridges the gap between federal and state law enforcement agencies by mandating information sharing of all state-specific criminal intelligence tips."

Sen. Rick Scott: U.S. Must Stay Strong in Trade Talks with Communist China  Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after Communist China requested another round of trade talks with the United States.
"Senator Rick Scott said, While its positive the United States is working towards a deal that would require Communist China to buy more U.S. agriculture products, lets remember  Communist China never lives up to the bargain."
Communist China is stealing our technology and refuses to open their markets to foreign goods as required by their agreement to be part of the WTO.
"They are militarizing the South China Sea, even after they promised President Obama they wouldnt, and breaking the agreement to give Hong Kong autonomy and freedom."
"Communist China is attacking religious freedom by detaining possibly more than one million Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority group in China, in internment and re-education camps."
"Earlier this year, Communist China agreed to buy more U.S. soy beans, but we havent seen that happen."
"They agreed to buy agriculture products earlier this year and didnt do it, so why should we believe them now?"

It is imperative that Congress conducts its investigations in a deliberate and comprehensive manner.
I remain committed to following the facts to whatever conclusion they lead.

Congressman Emmer sharing a federal update on FinTech development at the Future Finance Forum during Twin Cities Startup Week.
"As a member of the House Financial Services Committee as well as the Committees Taskforce on Financial Technology, anda co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus -I am in a unique position to advocate for Minnesota on fintech issues, as well as focus on the intersection of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency."
Fintech stands to dramatically empower the individual and promote access for those who have previously been excluded.
It is important that regulators provide clear rules of the road that ensure even the smallest startup with a brilliant idea can become a major enterprise.
"That is why I introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, which provides that certain blockchain-related entities that never take control of consumer funds do not need to register as a money transmitter."
"Examples of these entities include ""miners"" that validate network integrity and multi-signature providers that enhance security."
"To further support this missionI introduced the Main Street Growth Act,which will allow the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the creation of venture exchanges."
These specialized securities exchanges would help small and emerging growth companies gain access to the capital they need to grow and succeed.
The bill would also establish an Office of Venture Exchanges under its Division of Trading and Markets to study and monitor the effectiveness of these new exchanges.
Minnesotans can help lead the next digital revolution.
Change is coming in the ways we use money and the financial opportunities available to us.
We have an opportunity to embrace this change and foster these new innovations.

"This week, weve got Parent-Teacher Conferences."
Its always amazing to hear about the outstanding work our educators are doing.
Those who follow me on Facebook and Twitter know I visit a lot of schools.

I successfully sponsored an effort to make sure Pell Grants are available year-round.
"Additionally, earlier this month, I introduced bipartisan legislation called the Pell Plus Act of 2019."
This new bill will promote college completion by establishing partnerships between colleges and universities to provide a Pell Grant bonus to low-income students in their third and fourth years on a path to on-time graduation.
Our bill assures that on-time graduates receive the same amount of Pell Grant assistance as those who take six academic years to earn a degree.
"Ultimately, the net effect of this proposal would be totriplethe amount of Pell Grant assistance during the final two years of study for students who are on track to complete their studies within four years."
Thats a big deal for students and their families.
"The Pell Plus program will help students complete their college degree on-time, provide more financial aid, and lower their debt burden."
"This is a win for students, a win for educational institutions, and a win for local employers who are hungry for workers."
"Combating Foreign Interference in American Elections  Foreign interests shouldnt be able to influence American elections, period."
"With countless intelligence assessments confirming vulnerabilities in the American election system, and another election just over a year away, its vital that both sides of the aisle come together to take real action to protect our elections from foreign interference."
"This week, I was proud to be a lead co-sponsor of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, which will make a massive effort toward doing just that."
The SHIELD Act will:   Create a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign governments and their agents.
"Help prevent foreign interference in future elections by improving transparency of online political advertisements (through a bipartisan, bicameral bill I championed called the Honest Ads Act)."
Close loopholes that allow foreign nationals and foreign governments to spend in U.S. elections.
Restrict the exchange of campaign information between candidates and foreign governments and their agents.
Prohibit deceptive practices related to voting procedures.
"I was proud to see the Honest Ads Act, which is co-sponsored by 18 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the House, included in this legislation."
This bill will ensure Americans know who is paying for the online ads they are seeing and to make it harder for foreign actors to use the internet to attack our democracy.
Its been a priority of mine for a long time - and you can read a great write-up of what the bill would do from the News Tribune.
Congress should take action to further protect our democracy without delay.
Im hopeful that this bill will pass the House by the end of the month.
"Building Civility  There is a lot of division in our country these days and frankly, it takes work to try to find common ground."
Im a big believer that part of the way to better understand where people are coming from is to actually see where people are coming from.
"With that in mind, Ive been doing some civility exchanges over the last year in which I invite one of my Republican colleagues to visit our region and I go visit theirs."
"Last year, I visited eastern Washington with my Republican colleague Congressman Dan Newhouse, and I hosted him here."
"Earlier this year, I hosted Congressman Steve Womack, the Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, in our neck of the woods, and last week I visited his district in Northwest Arkansas."
"When Rep. Womack visited our region, I had the opportunity to highlight the ways the federal budget affects the unique culture and economy of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula."
He toured Olympic National Park to learn more about the maintenance backlog and legislation Im leading to address it.
We visited the Port of Tacoma and discussed the importance of trade and improving our freight mobility.
We toured Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to talk about the impacts of government shutdowns on federal workers and the need for infrastructure investments.
"Last week, I participated in the reciprocal visit."
"While in Arkansas, I spent a day and a half learning more about the local economy, the opportunities and challenges of the region, and the people that live there."
"We toured businesses big and small, held a student town hall at the University of Arkansas, and talked to folks about the issues theyre facing in everyday life."
"I appreciated being able to visit northwest Arkansas and learn more about that part of the country, the people that live there, and what that means to Congressman Womacks approach to his job."
"He and I dont agree with each other on everything - in fact, we disagree on a good chunk of things."
"But Im a believer that weve got to be able to talk through issues, listen to each other, and not have everything turn into the Jerry Springer Show."
"When Democrats and Republicans make the effort to understand one anothers perspectives, our country has a better shot at making progress on key issues facing the American people."
Providing Opportunities for Students to Attend U.S. Service Academies  One of the best parts of this job is being able to consider students for nominations to our nations military service academies.
"Every year, there are a lot of great applications and reading through them makes it pretty clear to me that our regions future is in good hands."
"On October 23 at 5:30 at the Bremerton School District Administration Building in Bremerton, Team Kilmer will be hosting an information session for interested students to learn more about the application and admission process to these academies."
"Students who are unable to attend, or who have questions about the application process, should contact my Tacoma office by calling 253-272-3515."
You can also check out more information about the application process onmy website!
"The Return of Quick Questions About Congress with Kilmer  As a lot of you may know, over the years Ive hosted a podcast called Quick Questions About Congress with Kilmer."
"Ive heard from a lot of you that you missed these unique interviews, so I wanted to let you know that its back in action!"
"For those of you new to the show, the podcast is meant to build understanding between lawmakers, forge new relationships, and create an avenue so members can work together to tackle critical issues facing our country."
Its also an opportunity for people around the country to learn more about the folks who serve in our nations capital.
These conversations help lead to collaboration on policies to help our constituents.
"For example, the bipartisan Pell Plus bill I introduced earlier this month was done in partnership with Episode 11 guestCongresswoman Susan W. Brooks."
"Last year, I passed the Stop School Violence Act, a bill to make schools safer and prevent gun violence, working in partnership with Episode 19 guestCongressman Ted Deutch."
Episode 22's guest isCongressman Tom Graves from northwest Georgia.
"We talk about southern hospitality, bipartisanship, and our collaboration on the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress to make Congress work better for the American people."
Working For You  Checking in on Progress at the Boys and Girls Club  I had a great time visiting with my friend Norma Turner and the great team from the Boys  Girls Clubs of the Olympic Peninsula.
I cant wait to see the new finished clubhouse in Port Angeles.
Hearing the Stories of our Tribal Communities  It was an honor to join the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians at their annual fall conference at the Suquamish Resort.
Listening to their stories has made me a better supporter for Indian Country.
"Supporting Healthier Communities  The boat moves best when all oars are in the water, rowing in the same direction."
It was inspiring to meet with theOlympic Peninsula Healthy Community Coalition; a group of amazing organizations focused on improving health and wellness in our region.
Thanks to Commissioner Mark Ozias for his leadership and for the invitation.
"Supporting our Workers  Last week, I was able to meet with a terrific group of leaders from the IFPTE Local 12 from the Shipyard."
I also visited with my friends Larry Brown and April Sims from the Washington State Labor Council.
I stand with them in supporting workers right to organize and negotiate better wages and working conditions.
I appreciate their partnership in working for an economy that works better for everyone!
Eating a Ton at Oyster Fest!
It was another fantastic afternoon at the 38th Annual Oyster Fest in Shelton!
I got to be a timer for an oyster shucking competition.
I got to pour beer in the beer garden (and have some awesome discussions with folks I represent).
I got to present awards to local wineries.
And I got to eat a ton of shellfish.
Thanks to the Shelton Rotary for everything you do to organize this incredible event - I look forward to it every year!
"Ok - thats it for now, folks."
"ICYMI: WE MUST EXPAND TELEHEALTH FOR VETERANS In case you missed it, I wrote an article in The Hill this week about the need to expand telehealth for veterans and legislation I introduced to address this."
Click here to read my article.
"We must expand telehealth for veterans By Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter The 1st District of Georgia has a rich military heritage and one of my greatest honors is serving the service members and veterans in Southeast and Coastal Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives."
"Although a couple hours from home, many of our veterans travel to Charleston, S.C., or Lake City, Fla., in order to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital and medical facility."
"I, too, often visit these facilities to see how we can improve the care these heroes receive."
"On a recent visit to the Charleston facility, we discussed a number of barriers that are standing in the way of better care for veterans."
One serious concern is the VAs current limitations on telehealth.
"The VA Mission Act, which I was proud to support in Congress and was later signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017, reformed multiple programs at the VA."
"It overhauled the Veterans CHOICE Program, improved the veterans caregiver program and aimed to modernize the VAs health care facilities."
"Additionally, the VA Mission Act authorized the VA to provide telehealth services across state lines."
This is critical because these VA health facilities are now able to give care to veteran patients in the First District without forcing those veterans to travel hours to South Carolina or Florida to be seen by a physician.
"However, while were making important strides in telehealth at the VA, there is still a big problem."
"While at the Charleston VA medical facility, I learned that only doctors are allowed to use telehealth systems and trainees are not permitted to use the program."
"Just like in any health care system, students, interns, residents and fellows are critical components of the VA."
They use these professionals in every aspect of care.
These medical providers have graduated medical school and are training to become full-time doctors.
They need access to the telehealth system so they are able to get the experience necessary to provide the best possible care to veterans once they are fully licensed.
"Additionally, allowing this population of health care professionals to use the telehealth system will increase access to this important care by increasing the number of providers."
That is why I introduced H.R.
"3228, the VA Mission Telehealth Clarification Act in the United States Congress."
My legislation authorizes trainees to use the telehealth program under the supervision of an appropriately credentialed VA medical professional.
This will allow better access to VA health care as well as better prepare future doctors to use the system.
Our veterans served our nation and deserve access to the best possible care when they return home.
Increasing the use of telehealth at VA health centers is critical to ensure veterans are able to receive the care they need no matter where they live.
"The VA Mission Telemedicine Clarification Act is only one small step to improve the health care system for veterans, but it is an important step that should be taken immediately FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXXXVII Monday, October 7, 2019: Now in its fourteenth year, the Buddy Walk, sponsored by the Lowcountry Down Syndrome Society (LDSS), is held in Forsyth Park in downtown Savannah every year and this past Saturday drew thousands of people."
LDSS is a family support group for people in the greater Savannah and Lowcountry area that have been touched by Down syndrome.
I was very proud to join my brothers from the Band of Brothers on Saturday as we supported our good friend and fellow member Joe Marchese and his beautiful daughter Ella at the Buddy Walk.
"Rep. Carter at the Buddy Walk This is a special event for me, as well, as I grew up with an aunt who had Down syndrome and have fond memories of the joys and challenges my grandparents had raising a child with Down syndrome."
My Aunt Jean was an integral part of our family.
She was always accepted and included everywhere we went.
I can still remember my family going out to eat at Williams Seafood in Savannah with my grandfather in his suit and tie with his arm extended and my Aunt Jean holding on as if he were walking her down the wedding aisle.
Later Saturday morning I was able to stop by the Georgia Republican Leadership Academy held at the American Legion Post 184 in Thunderbolt to speak to them.
"On Sunday afternoon I was back at Forsyth Park as I attended one of the best events anywhere, Picnic in the Park, Savannahs largest outdoor musical event."
"Rep. Carter at Picnic in the Park Sponsored by the City of Savannah and others, this beloved event featured not only students from local schools and colleges, but also the US Army 3rd ID band and, of course, the world-class Savannah Philharmonic."
Im in Atlanta today as I have a number of meetings in the area before joining Governor Brian Kemp and others at the Georgia GOP 2019 Chairmans Dinner.
"Tuesday, October 8, 2019: After arriving back home late last night, my first event of the day is at the Georgia Tech Savannah Campus as I speak at the Georgia Alternative Fuel Vehicle and Clean Technology Showcase and share with them my experiences as a member of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee."
"As a member of the E&C Environment Subcommittee as well as the Select Committee on Climate Change, we have considered many bills dealing with autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, compressed natural gas vehicles, and much more."
"Rep. Carter at the Georgia Alternative Fuel Vehicle and Clean Technology Showcase Afterwards, I head to our Savannah office where I have a very productive meeting with a representative from the Savannah Freedom Society followed by a meeting with representatives from Twin Pines Minerals regarding their proposed project in Charlton County."
"Next, I meet with representatives from Coastal Empire Habitat for Humanity to learn more of the great work they are doing in the Savannah area before heading to Hinesville in Liberty County to meet with constituents from Liberty and Long Counties."
"Afterwards, I head to Cogdell in Clinch County where I meet with a number of constituents from the area."
"Wednesday, October 9, 2019: Im up early this morning as I head to the Coastal Heritage Society Battlefield Memorial March in downtown Savannah where we honor those who fought and sacrificed for our freedom on the 240th anniversary of the Battle of Savannah during the Revolutionary War."
Rep. Carter at the Coastal Heritage Society Battlefield Memorial March The Battle of Savannah was one of the Revolutionary Wars most pivotal battles and is where Gen. Casimir Pulaski was killed.
"Complete with soldiers clothed in uniforms from that period who marched along the same path as the original battle, participants laid wreaths in Battlefield Park during a commemorative ceremony."
"Afterwards, I head out to Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool in Bryan County where I read to a group of preschool classes in celebration of Georgia Pre-K Week."
"Rep. Carter with students at Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool Of the three books that I read, I have to say that my personal favorite was Llama, Llama Red Pajama."
"Afterwards, I head to midtown Savannah for a meeting with a constituent before heading to the Savannah Area Realtors Luncheon at the Hellenic Center in downtown Savannah where I am honored to be their guest speaker."
"Thursday, October 10, 2019: Im at Lake Raybun in North Georgia this weekend for my youngest sons wedding and this morning I have a conference call with my good friend Col. Daniel Hibner, Commander of the Savannah District of the US Army Corp of Engineers, to discuss a project in the district."
"Later, I have a phone interview with The Capitol Forum to discuss new Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rules that are being proposed that would give the agency the authority to review non-controlling investments in 28 new categories, including some in the chemical industry."
"News from Representative David Cicilline                     October 11, 2019       Dear Friend,  President Trump, without consulting with our allies and at the request of the thuggish President of Turkey, undermined American national security by greenlighting Turkeys attack on our Kurdish allies in the Middle East."
Kurdish troops in Syria did what the President never has  they signed up to fight alongside the American military.
The Kurds have been a critical ally in our fight against ISIS.
The Presidents decision to abandon them now is a betrayal.
"It is wrong, and it will make it harder for our allies to trust that we keep our word."
I led several of my colleagues this week in pressing the Pentagon for answers on why the President abruptly changed course in Syria and abandoned one of our most trusted allies.

"Impeachment  Every day, it seems, President Trump manages to admit more crimes and dig a deeper hole for himself."
"Last week, in fact, he admitted on camera to actions that Republican Senator Mitt Romney said are unacceptable."
We cannot allow our democracy to be destroyed like this.
Asking a foreign country to interfere in an American election is an impeachable offense.

10 News Conference  I just finished taping a 30-minute discussion with Gene Valicenti for 10 News Conference that will air this weekend on Channel 10.
"                         Dear Friend,  Friday was National Manufacturing Day and yesterday marked the end of Minnesota Manufacturing Week."
"As one of the main drivers of the economy, manufacturing generates billions of dollars in revenue each year for Minnesota, and provides an impressive 292,000 manufacturing jobs for Minnesotans across the state."
"Altogether, 33 percent of Minnesotas total workforce is connected to the manufacturing lifeblood of the state."
"Currently, our state and nation is facing a skills gap crisis that has shown no signs of slowing down, and the tech sector is desperately looking for more employees."
"In fact, the United States is expected to have 1.8 million unfilled tech jobs by 2024, which - left unfilled - would have detrimental consequences for our nation."
Thats why I am a cosponsor of the CHANCE in TECH Act.
Legislation like this aims to combat the skills gap crisis in the tech sector by fostering the creation of private-public partnerships and establish new apprenticeship programs that will give the generation of tomorrow the tools they need to bring the United States into the 21st century and beyond.
"Congressman Emmer hosting his annual Young Women Leadership Program at Metal Craft in Elk River, Minnesota."
Metal Craft is a facility thatspecializes in medical and surgical instrument manufacturing.
"I was also proud to vote for the American Manufacturing Leadership Act, which reauthorizes and extends the Manufacturing USA program at the Department of Commerce."
"This program is a public-private partnership between governments, universities and industry focused on manufacturing innovation and facilitating collaboration across federal agencies in implementing advanced manufacturing initiatives."
"Finally, I along with several of my colleagues sent a letter in support of the Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Program (IRAP) proposal - issued by the Department of Labor - which would help to expand apprenticeship programs in industries currently lacking training."
"Importantly, this program recognizes the value and preserves existing apprenticeship programs such as the ones in the construction and building trades."
"As a member of the Manufacturing Caucus, I am committed to ensuring that Congress is focused on manufacturing friendly policies."
"I have long supported and worked to expand technical education, such as apprenticeship programs in order to better align the next generations workforce with the industry."
"We must focus on workforce development and training of trades, which are so crucial to our future success."
"I am proud to support manufacturing day in our country, but I want to make it clear that in Minnesota every day is Manufacturing Day!"
"Sincerely,    TONIGHT:  Please join me at my town hall in Blaine tonight."
"We will begin at 7:00PM at the Blaine City Hall located at 10801 Town Square Dr NE, Blaine, MN 55449."
Call my district office if you have any questions at 763-241-6848.
I hope to see you there!

Impeachment: A Partisan Distraction I enjoy using this column to discuss important but less well-known issues that affect the lives of Southwest Virginians.
"As your representative in Washington, I work on policy matters that make a difference in our communities, such as economic development, health care, and rural broadband."
"These topics may not grab headlines, but they are vital, and I do my best to keep you up to date on developments."
"While traveling the Ninth District during the October district work period, I took part in events that offer valuable opportunities for our communities."
"Over the past several years, I have worked to secure federal funding for Virginia through the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Pilot Program, and on October 2 I helped announce two more projects to restore land for economic development purposes."
"The Dante Community Redevelopment Project in Russell County received $269,000 for developing trail networks and closing mine portals."
"The Dickenson County Public Service Authority received $356,500 for extending waterline to serve a campground."
Both grants will increase the regions appeal for tourism and promote job growth.
"On October 3, I visited Virginia Tech and learned more about the important research being done there."
"Some of it has the potential to reshape economic opportunities in rural areas, such as the ongoing development of space technology, which includes building satellites similar to those companies such as Amazon are developing to bring broadband to rural areas."
"Later that evening, I spoke at the New River Valley Rail 2020 Legislative Reception, an event to support the extension of passenger rail service further into Southwest Virginia."
Progress in all of these areas could tangibly benefit citizens of the Ninth District in their lives and deserve our attention and effort.
We have important work to do.
"But unfortunately, the House Democrat decision to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump threatens to absorb our attention and block progress on the things that matter."
"When I talk to constituents, I frequently hear their frustration about Democrats pursuing investigation after investigation after investigation into President Trump."
"To be clear, I support legitimate oversight of every administration."
It is a fundamental congressional responsibility.
"The Democrat approach to President Trump, however, has been to launch inquisitions that start by presuming the President guilty at the outset and rooting around for possible evidence of guilt afterward."
This impeachment inquiry is no different.
"Speaker Pelosi announced it on September 24, the day before the transcript of President Trumps supposedly-incriminating phone conversation with the President of Ukraine was made public."
I read that transcript and the whistleblower complaint from a member of the intelligence community that was later released.
"They did not contain anything which would justify the impeachment of the President of the United States, an action taken by the House of Representatives only twice in our history, or his removal, never done by the Senate."
"I might not have used the words President Trump used in his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but I did not find the substance inappropriate."
"If it was inappropriate, as most Democrats in the House think, then the question is: was it appropriate for former Vice President Joe Biden to brag about telling Ukrainian officials, Im leaving in six hours."
"If the prosecutor is not fired, youre not getting the money, referring to $1 billion in American loan guarantees?"
"Remember, that prosecutor was looking into the company his son worked with."
Three Democratic senators also would have a lot to answer for if President Trumps call with President Zelensky crossed a legal line.
"In May 2018, Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to Ukraines Prosecutor General."
"They begin their letter noting how the United States has aided Ukraine, then shift to demanding that country cooperate with an investigation of President Trump, their political rival."
"Justice demands that if the President be held to a particular standard, these Democrat officials should be as well."
"Justice is not the aim of this impeachment inquiry, in my opinion."
"For the next several months, the attention of the House and of the nation will be focused on a political campaign against President Trump."
This is not healthy for our Republic.
It is still not too late for Democrats to drop the theatrics and start working on the real issues facing the American people.

"Working to Support Kansas Law Enforcement Inviting Attorney General William Barr to Kansas On Wednesday, I hosted Attorney General William Barr to tour key facilities in Topeka and Wichita and to meet with state and local law enforcement."
"In Topeka, we visited the Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center and the Kansas Bureau of Investigations Forensic Science Center."
"Both facilities work in partnership with agencies and jurisdictions throughout Kansas, and we heard an update on their work to assist law enforcement in solving and fighting crime in every corner of the state."
In Wichita we joined staff of the U.S.
Attorneys office to discuss ongoing partnerships to fight and prosecute crime and met with folks at Wichita State University engaged in work between the universitys Law Enforcement Training Center and the ATF.
Both components in Topeka and Wichita are vital to Kansans and to the professionals who work to protect our communities.
"Most importantly, in both Topeka and Wichita, we spent time with law enforcement officials to hear firsthand how we can best support them at the federal level."
"As the chief appropriator of the Department of Justice, Im committed to working with Attorney General Barr to make certain our law enforcement personnel have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep communities safe across Kansas and the country."
"An essential part of keeping our communities safe is creating partnerships between federal, state and local law enforcement to accomplish their mission."
Im proud of the work weve seen from all across the state to increase collaboration for the safety and well-being of Kansans.
"Attorney General Barr has a deep appreciation for our men and women in uniform, and I thank him for meeting with Kansas law enforcement during his time in our state."

"Announcing the Reopening of DEAs Garden City Office On Monday morning I joined officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the Garden City Police Department to announce the reopening of the Garden City DEA field office."
The reopening of this office will enhance efforts by local law enforcement to get drugs off the streets and stop the flow of contraband to the rest of the country.
"Since its closure in 2017, weve worked to demonstrate the regions need for this office, and through my role as the chief appropriator for the DEA, Ive worked to make certain there are the necessary resources to complete the reopening."
I look forward to seeing the many benefits this office will provide to Southwest Kansas and the entire state.

"Autism CARES Act Signed Into Law This week, the president signed theAutism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support,or theCARES Act,into law."
"I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation that is the strongest-ever package of federal support for research, services and training for the autism community."
"According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism impacts an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States, and often comes with lifelong health and quality of life challenges."
"Additional research funding in this legislation will improve our understanding of autism through research at the National Institutes of Health, the CDC and the Health Resources and Services Administration."
"Ultimately, through these important investments, we will be able to better care for this unique and vibrant community."

"Celebrating Spirit AeroSystems Partnership with Wichita State On Friday, I attended the grand opening of the Spirit AeroSystems Research Collaboration Center which is housed at the Wichita State University (WSU) Innovation Campus."
The center establishes a unique partnership between Spirit and the university through the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) and WSU Tech.
This partnership will accelerate and enhance Spirits research and development objectives as well as applied learning opportunities that better prepare students for the aviation and aerospace industries.
"As co-chair of the Senate Aerospace Caucus and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I look forward to working further with these two exceptional organizations to further solidify Wichitas place as the Air Capital of the World."
"Congratulations to all those who made this special occasion possible, and special thanks to Spirit CEO Tom Gentile and WSU Vice President for Research and Technology John Tomblin for their leadership."
"Watching the K-State Game On Saturday, I was at Bill Snyder Family Stadium in Manhattan to watch K-State play the Baylor Bears."
This weeks game was Fort Riley Day and honored the men and women who serve in the 1st Infantry Division and at Fort Riley.
The K-State Marching Band paid tribute to those serving our military around the world with a halftime performance that included the military anthems for each branch of the armed forces.
"During the game, I had the opportunity to visit with good friends Van Witthuhn, Eldon Stoecklein, Pat Parke, Carolyn States and Carol and Eric Hartman."
"Hosting Kansas Listening Tour Stops Seward County On Monday, I was in Liberal for a stop on my Kansas Listening Tour."
"During this townhall meeting, I discussed a number of items with folks from Seward County including my work to increase veterans access to healthcare through the VA MISSION Act, the need for Congress to pass USMCA, the current farm economy, crop insurance, immigration reform, access to mental healthcare, the need for updated infrastructure, rural broadband and gun violence."
"Thank you to all those who attended for their productive conversation, and to the Liberal Lions Club for their hospitality."
"Meade County On Monday afternoon, I hosted a Kansas Listening Tour stop in Meade County."
"During this stop, local residents and I discussed a number of issues including healthcare in rural communities, veterans access to care, agriculture and the need to pass USMCA for farmers and ranchers, immigration, gun violence, rural broadband and my work to make certain rural America can thrive."
Thanks to those from across Meade County for taking time to share their thoughts and ideas with me on Monday.
"Visiting with Impressive Kansas Students Plains Elementary School Prior to my Meade County Listening Tour stop, I joined students and staff of Plains Elementary School."
"A special thank you to Plains Elementary School 5th grade students Emilee, Lindanis and Juanluis for the great tour of their school."
"These bright, curious and passionate students represented PES so well and are a testament to the dedicated and caring teachers in their lives."
"During our tour, they demonstrated a number of ways students and teachers are employing new and innovative methods of thinking and learning and provided a robust update on their activities and things happening in the community."
"They also asked impressive and insightful questions on current topics in public policy, matters before the Senate as they relate to their community and even expressed a desire to one day have careers in public service."
"I was pleased to have the Commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, Dr. Randy Watson, along for the tour, as well as State Board of Education member Jean Clifford, USD 483 Superintendent Elton Argo and Principals Ryan Kisner, Dan Frisby and Kurt Stanfield."
A special thank you to Bri Frisby for the kind invitation to join these students for the day.
"Riley County High School On Thursday, I joined student leaders to tour Riley County High School, home of the Falcons."
"While touring the school, students and administrators discussed the programs theyve implemented to prepare students for their next steps in life."
"Riley County High Schools programming emphasizes both technical education, through numerous agriculture, woodworking, and welding courses, as well as college preparatory programs allowing students to capitalize on their time in school and earn credits towards a college degree."
Rural schools across Kansas are working to address the shortage in our states workforce by continuing to prioritize STEM education and create career pipelines for students after they graduate.
"Newton High School On Friday, I was in Newton where I joined student leaders for a tour of Newton High School."
"During the tour, I heard updates on fall activities, NHS athletic teams, different things happening in the classroom and new programs and courses."
We visited a number of career and technical education-focused classrooms where teachers are working to prepare students for the workforce and various secondary educational paths.
My time at Newton High School came just ahead of Department of Education Assistant Secretary Scott Stumps tour of the high school specifically geared toward their career and technical education offerings.
"I know that Mr. Stump will be as impressed as I was with the quality of work, commitment from students and dedication of teachers at Newton High School."
Now Accepting Spring Internship Applications My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974.
"As an intern, I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates and how the legislative process works."
"I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate office today, where I have interns year-round working closely with my staff on behalf of Kansans."
"Applications for internships in my Washington, D.C. and Kansas offices for the spring 2020 session are due October 25."
Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in public service and have achieved academic excellence.

"However, I was glad to be back home last week for our October District Work Period."
"It allowed me the opportunity to meet with many constituents and attend events in our community, which is my favorite part of the job."
"Additionally, I am continuing to work behind the scenes with my colleagues in both parties to advance policies that will improve the lives of Americans."
Continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf last week.
"Growing the Economy  The September JobsReport released last week shows that 136,000 more jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month and the national unemployment rate fell to a new 50 year low, at 3.5%."
We must continue to focus on creating an environment where innovation can thrive and growth can occur.
Friday was National Manufacturing Day.
Manufacturing jobs are vital to the U.S. economy.
"In honor of this important day, my team participated in the Upper Tampa Bay Chamber of Commerce's annual Manufacturing Day Dinner."
The theme of the dinner was Develop Your Talent Pipeline.
Access to skilled labor is critical to the success of manufacturing and other high tech sectors.
This theme recognizes the ongoing work of the Tampa Bay Partnership in employing a nationally validated model to assist in raising the bar for the manufacturing and healthcare sectors.
I appreciate the meaningful work of this dedicated group and will continue to support their efforts.
"Additionally, my team participated in a Manufacturing Day event at Leggett  Platt, a successful manufacturing firm in my district."
This company opens its doors every year for high school students to come in and learn about the manufacturing industry.
Providing this type of hands-on learning opportunity helps to develop the talent pipeline that is needed within the industry.
Protecting Seniors by Strengthening Medicare  I was pleased to participate in the signing of last weeks Executive Order on Medicare.
"Im glad to see this Administration introduce more choice and price-lowering competition in Medicare Advantage, address the provider shortage by aligning provider scope of practice with state law, streamline the coverage determination process to expedite access to new technologies and improve transparency and program integrity measures to better combat fraud, waste, and abuse."
Last Congress a broad reform package addressing the nation's opioid crisis was signed into law.
I authored several provisions of the law including one which created a drug management program  also known as a lock-in program  to prevent physician shopping and pharmacy shopping within the Medicare program.
Its time to put patients over politics.
We must work together to strengthen and improve Medicare for our seniors and future enrollees.
"Improving the Care for Our Heroes  The VA MISSION Act, streamlined VA's duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program."
"The recently released VFW Our Care report includes data from nearly 7,000 Veterans."
The responses from these Veterans indicate that the MISSION Act is delivering on its promises.
I look forward to continuing to build upon this success to ensure all Veterans receive the care they deserve.
"As noted in this article, it is shameful that the House recently passed legislation that would give illegal immigrants access to electronic health records years ahead of the schedule we have funded to provide this level of care to Veterans."
"I voted against the bill, and also supported an amendment that would have prioritized funding for e-medical records for Veterans, but the amendment failed."
My hope is that common sense will prevail in the Senate.
Protecting Consumers   Millions of Americans continue to die from opioid overdoses.
Safeguards are critical to ensuring best prescribing practices.
I applaud the FDA forcracking down on the illegal sale of opioids online.
Clickhere to see me questioning Mark Zuckerberg about this very issue.
Im glad to see the FDA is finally taking this concern seriously.
Promoting Public Health  Thisstory reveals troubling information about Floridas low rates of vaccination.
Vaccines are vital to ensuring public health and safety.
"They save lives, which is why I co-authored the VACCINES Act (H.R."
2862) earlier this year.
"This bipartisan bill will help increase immunization rates across the country and prevent future outbreaks of contagious, deadly diseases."
"Additionally, part of promoting public health is having systems in place that help keep violent criminals off the street."
"Instead of wasting time grandstanding on politically motivated games during our last week in DC before the October District Work Period, House Leadership should have accepted our attempt to vote on S. 820, the Debbie Smith Act, which provides necessary funding to address the national rape kit backlog."
"The annual funding, which was reauthorized in 2008 and 2014, expired last week."
The funding it provides for DNA testing is critical to proving crimes of a sexual nature and vital to getting predators off our streets.
"These are the type of tangible problems that need our attention, and we should have bipartisan support to get it done rather than engaging in petty partisanship."
"My hope is that when we return to DC, my colleagues will join me in expediting passage of this crucial legislation."
Learning from You  I enjoyed meeting with constituents and providing a legislative update at Heritage Pines last week.
"I received helpful feedback from many of them regarding the VA, the need to protect Medicare and the direction of our country."
I assured them that I will continue to focus on their priorities and work to get things done.
Raising Awareness  Domestic Violence is a significant public health issue that has considerable societal costs.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 1/5 women and 1/7 men have been victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives.
"Additionally, over 7 million American children live in a home in which domestic violence has occurred."
There is help available and hope for a life free of violence.
"If you or someone you know suffers from some form of domestic violence, please call the national help line."
October is also Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
We must continue to invest in the critical research that holds the promise for a cure.
I was proud that Team Bilirakis was able to participate in a recent event to help raise awareness and funds to support local breast cancer fighters.
"Additionally, starting 10/1/20, every air traveler (domestic and international) will need to provide a REAL ID-compliant card or passport to travel."
They will no longer be able to use their drivers license as a form of ID unless its REAL ID-compliant.
It is important to plan in advance to avoid delays.

"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following note from a constituent in Safety Harbor."
I just want to thank you and your entire team.
I know that without your intervention my request to expedite review of my wifes Visa application would not have happened.

"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends meetings, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team enjoyed participating in two Habitat for Humanity dedications in Dade City last week.
The stories of these two families on their journey to receive their forever homes were inspirational!
Congratulations and best wishes!
"My team was excited to attend last week's Zephyrhills Chamber of Commerce breakfast and listen to Dr. Torres, Medical Director of Advent Health, who spoke about hospital scoring systems."
These tools help us measure patient outcomes and ensure quality care.
"My team was proud to be a part of the Grand Opening of Healthy  Fresco, a new Veteran-owned small business in Land O Lakes."
We appreciate your service to our nation and welcome you to our community!
My team was also excited to participate in the City of Dunedin's Legislative Priorities Workshop.
I look forward to working alongside these local leaders to secure positive results for our mutual constituents.
"Additionally, my team enjoyed participating in a meaningful discussion at last week's Climate and Energy Summit."

"                 Representative Matt Gaetz  U.S. Representative for the First District of Florida 1721 Longworth House Office Building  Washington, DC 20515(202) 225-4136                                    Hello, Friends As we enter the second week of the formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, one thing is clear: nothing has changed."
"Democrats are still grasping at straws, now basing their impeachment efforts on  what else?"
"collusion, this time with Ukraine."
Last time it was Russia.
Now its Russias next-door neighbor.
"The Democrats leading this charade are being hypocritical  especially Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who blatantly  quotes from President Trumps phone call with the President of Ukraine."
Is this what weve come to?
Mr. Schiff is obsessed with finding dirt on the President.
But remember when he was caught on tape trying to solicit salacious information from Ukrainian politicians (who actually turned out to be Russian prankster radio hosts) about President Trump?
Watch it below:        Click to Play!
"If youre following along at home with the Democrats game of pin the tail on the impeachment theory, theyve gone from collusion, to obstruction of justice, to emoluments, and now to a whistleblower on President Trumps Ukraine."
"You wouldnt be able to get the so-called evidence from this whistleblower admitted into a court of law, so how do the Democrats expected to use it as a basis to impeach a president?"
"Ive spent this week back home in Florida, and it is clear to me that the American people are NOT convinced by any of the Democrats arguments."
(I think its telling that Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry and then immediately followed it up with a Congressional recess).
"On Tuesday, I went on Fox Business to talk with Lou Dobbs about the Democrats hypocrisy."
Watch our discussion here:        Click to Play!
"My friend and colleague, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) has introduced a bill to  the actions of House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, which I have cosponsored."
"Mr. Schiff has abused his position as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and has betrayed the trust of the American people."
"His , to quote Rep. Devin Nunes, has gone on long enough."
"The Klopfer Tragedy Last month, 2,246 preserved human fetal remains were found on the property of the home of Abortionist Ulrich George Klopfer."
"Before he died, Mr. Klopfer committed truly heinous acts during his time as a doctor in Northern Indiana."
"I have signed a joint letter to Attorney General Barr, requesting an investigation of this horrific matter, and an evaluation of laws in place regarding the burial and cremation of human fetal remains."
The letter orders a full criminal investigation if deemed appropriate of Mr. Klopfers actions.
"Read more:  The Blaze  October 1, 2019  67 House Republicans call on DOJ to help investigate thousands of fetal remains found at abortionists home   Religious Liberty Last week, President Trump gave an address on religious liberty at the United Nations in New York City."
I want to highlight one particularly notable line of his speech: The United States is founded on the principle that our rights do not come from government; they come from God.
Im proud to live in a country where our President acknowledges the importance of religious liberty and the freedom to worship.
These rights are vital for a liberty to prosper in any country  and they are alive and well in ours!
"Read the Presidents full speech here:     POTUS in the Villages Yesterday, while in The Villages, President Trump signed an Executive Order to improve seniors healthcare by giving patients more plan choices, more access to telehealth, and new therapies."
"His plan includes removing obstacles to improved patient care and protecting beneficiaries by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse."
President Trump is Making America Great Again for Americans of ALL ages!
"AROUND THE DISTRICT Cybersecurity at Corry Station On Thursday, I had the privilege of visiting the folks at the Department of Homeland Securitys National Network Protection Facility at Corry Station."
"This national security facility in Escambia County helps detect, deter, and prevent cyberattacks nationwide  yet another way in which Northwest Florida contributes prominently to Americas defense."
I am immensely proud of the work being done to protect our nation in Floridas First Congressional District!
"Everglades Restoration Yesterday, Governor Ron DeSantis  that the Florida Crystals Corporation is terminating its lease on lands needed for Everglades Restoration Projects."
The termination of this contract will allow the expedition of the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir Project to fight harmful algal blooms.
"This is a huge step towards restoration of the Everglades, and an enormous win for the entire state of Florida."
Governor DeSantis continues to deliver results!

                  HOW CAN ALAN HELP?
LEGISLATION 47TH DISTRICT ABOUT ALAN CONTACT ALAN                 In This Edition  The presidents attempt to coerce a foreign government to interfere in our 2020 election led to the start of an impeachment inquiry in the House.
I sent a letter to the Mexican Government on the fifth anniversary of the disappearance of 43 students in Ayotzinapa.
"Despite the wave of headlines coming out of Washington this week, the House continued to work on many critical issues unrelated to impeachment."
"Last week, I was honored to join Billie Jean King for the opening of the new Long Beach main library named after her."
"This week in the Inbox, I share my response to constituents who contacted me with concerns about facial recognition software."
"If you have ever wanted to obtain an American flag that has flown over the U.S. Capitol, read Congress U this week to learn how."
"Lastly, dont forget to look at last weeks poll results, and make sure you take this weeks poll in the right-hand column."
CONNECT WITH ME                   Do you support impeachment proceedings against President Trump over his attempt to pressure a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election?
"Yes   No   Maybe   Don't know/Unsure   If you have a problem, click here to open survey in a new window                 The Start Of An Impeachment Inquiry  A federal government whistleblower has detailed actions taken by President Trump and the White House, that if proven true, call for the impeachment of the president."
"What the  to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson () was that President Trump's attempt to coerce the government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election was so egregious that White House officials who listened in on President Trumps July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed,"" and, feared they had ""witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain."""
This led to an attempt by White House officials to cover up the call by confiscating and securing printed and electronic copies of the written summary.
"In just under 10 pages it describes not only the president's illegal acts, but the details of the attempted cover-up, as well as the broader actions taken by the president, above and beyond the phone call, to coerce Ukraine to manufacture politically damaging material on Vice President Biden."
This is exactly why the House had no choice but to start the impeachment process.
"For years, the president has careened from shameful actions to inhumane policies to outright disregard for the rule of law."
He has continually put his self-interest and profits above his duty to both the Constitution and the American people.
The presidents attempts to influence the 2020 election through a foreign government--and the lies and obfuscation that surround ityet again crosses the line both constitutionally and legally.
I intend to vote for articles of impeachment that detail President Trumps high crimes and misdemeanors.
"I was elected to uphold the constitutional duties of a Member of Congress, including holding the president accountable."
It is time to hold this president accountable.
"Anniversary Of 43 Disappeared Students In Mexico  This week, I marked the fifth anniversary of the forced disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa, Guerrero, Mexico by leading a Congressional letter to the Mexican government offering support for recent efforts by the new Mexican administration to bring truth and justice to the families."
"At the same time, I also raised strong concerns about the ongoing failure to secure convictions in the case and urged further progress in the face of investigative setbacks."
"In September 2014, 43 Mexican student teachers from Ayotzinapa, Mexico, disappeared while traveling to Mexico City."
"To date, the remains of only one of the students has been positively identified."
"In the past five years, at least 80 suspects have been arrested, though no one has yet been tried or convicted."
"Questioning Interior Department Solicitor  Despite the swirl of headlines out of Washington, D.C. this week, it is important to remember that the regular business of the House, including work on many critical issues, continues."
My colleagues and I on the Natural Resources Committee remain focused on protecting our environment and addressing climate change.
"This week, we passed legislation that would help coastal communities design and implement climate-resilient living shorelines."
"Further, we reauthorized the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, important bipartisan legislation to protect and restore wetlands and their habitat."
I also took the Trump Administration directly to task for overturning Obama Administration cancellations of mining leases next to the Boundary Waters Wilderness in Minnesota.
"During testimony before our committee, I pressed Solicitor Daniel Jorjani, of the U.S. Department of the Interior--an appointee of President Trump--on why these leases were renewed."
"I also asked him if these renewals had anything to do with his three earlier meetings with the lease owner, who just happens to be Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trumps landlord here in DC."
Watch our back and forth by  or the image below.
"Honoring Long Beach Native Billie Jean King Last week, I had the pleasure of joining Long Beachs own Billie Jean King to dedicate our new Billie Jean King Main Library at the just-opened Long Beach Civic Center."
It was such a pleasure to share a few moments with her and to join in the celebration as our city honored her inspiring legacy and continuing contributions.
"The word icon is simply too small to capture the enormous impact she has had on not just tennis, not just on the United States, but on the world."
"She is a pioneer in athletics, a trailblazer in the fight for equality, a role model for women and the LGBT community, and an inspiration to every American."
She has not only earned this honor--she deserves it for the ground she has broken and the paths that she has set.
"Also in recognition of her contributions, I joined with then-Congressman Joe Crowley in the last Congress to introduce the Billie Jean King Congressional Gold Medal Act."
The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards in the United States.
"Unfortunately, the legislation was not moved out of committee by the GOP committee leadership."
"I plan on introducing the legislation again during this Congress, and now with a Democratic majority in the House, I feel confident we can move the bill toward passage."
"My office receives hundreds of letters, emails, and calls each week from constituents wanting to share their views and concerns on a variety of topics."
"Recently, I have received many messages from constituents on the topic of facial recognition software."
Below is my response to those messages: Facial recognition software is a technological innovation that has made its way into our daily lives.
The technology recognizes our facial features and scans existing photo and video databases to find a match.
"Although the technology has the potential to aid in security and policing interests, privacy organizations are worried facial recognition could seriously threaten the digital privacy of everyday Americans."
I share your concerns and have always fought to protect my constituents digital privacy.
There is no question that electronic surveillance powers for our intelligence community have helped keep Americans safe.
"However, these authorities must also protect the fundamental right to a reasonable expectation of privacy for every American citizen and uphold the protections granted by the Fourth Amendment which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures."
"Like you, I believe that Americans privacy should be protected in the same way that your physical property is."
"However, our policies have not kept pace with modern telecommunications technology, and I believe that Congress must re-evaluate these programs to ensure that Americans privacy is protected."
"I am a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Working Group on Surveillance, a group of members dedicated to privacy protection and surveillance reform."
"In that capacity, I am working with my colleagues to strengthen civil liberties protections as Congress considers the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in the coming months."
"If you have written in to me, please continue to do so."
"If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about."
You can find out how to contact me on my website by          Own A Flag Flown Over The U.S. Capitol The American Flag has varied quite a bit over the history of our nation.
Our current 50-star flag is the only version of the flag to have lasted more than 50 years without being changed.
"All told, there have been 27 official versions of the U.S. flag, most with a different amount of stars, but even a few with more than 13 stripes."
"US flag with 15 stars and 15 stripes flies over Fort McHenry, location of the bombardment during the War of 1812 that inspired the Star-Spangled Banner."
"Thanks to the Capitol Flag Program, members of the public can purchase new flags that have been flown over the Capitol."
Since 1937 the Architect of the Capitol has run the flag program allowing members of the public to purchase flags flown over the Capitol through their Representatives or Senators offices.
The program was so successful that an official Flag Office was created in the 1950s.
"The Architects office fulfills all flag requests, flying the requested flags on special poles at the Capitol on every day of the year, weather permitting, excluding Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day."
"Since 1976, after it is flown over the U.S. Capitol, each flag is issued a keepsake Certificate of Authenticity by the Architect of the Capitol."
"Currently, the Architect of the Capitol fulfills more than 100,000 flag requests from Members of Congress annually, with the number of requests and the popularity of the Capitol Flag Program growing steadily each year."
"If you are interested in ordering a flag that has flown over the Capitol for a loved one or for a special occasion,       Should California be allowed to set their own auto emission standards above the federal levels?"
"                                       News from Washington and Across West Texas Dear Friend,  This week in Washington was one of the most embarrassing in recent memory, as Democrats became a parody of themselves and passed the point of no return when Speaker Pelosi announced she would support an impeachment inquiry after fabricating a deceptive narrative over a phone call President Trump had with the Ukrainian President."
"Even without knowing the facts and before the transcript of the call was released, Speaker Pelosi irresponsibly, carelessly, and prematurely rushed to conclusions and alleged the President had committed high crimes."
This latest installment of the impeachment saga further exposes the Democrats blood lust for removing this President from office and nullifying the votes of 63 million Americans.
"By acquiescing to the demands of her far-left liberal base, Speaker Pelosi showed us that she is not serious about governing or passing bipartisan proposals like the USMCA or prescription drug pricing."
"While the die may be cast for the Democrats on impeachment, I know the American people will have little patience for this political posturing through endless investigation."

"Expanding Access to our Third Largest Ag Market While Democrats in Washington were wasting time on partisan, politically-charged impeachment, President Trump was in New York at the United Nations working hard on the peoples business and putting America first."
"Perhaps the most important action item to come out of the U.N. was the new trade deal President Trump announced with Japan, our third largest agriculture export, which will reduce or eliminate tariffs on over $7 billion of U.S. ag product."
"Opening up access to the Japanese market for our agriculture products is a big win for our farmers and ranchers as well as rural America, and doing more free and fair trade deals in the Asia Pacific region will also mitigate Chinas unjustified tariffs and pressure them to stop their unfair practices."
"Along with the free market reforms we have been enacting at home, these America-first trade policies abroad will ensure the United States will remain the land of opportunity and unparalleled prosperity for the next generation."

"Obstructing the Presidents Border Security Policies Even though defending our sovereign borders and protecting our citizens is the first and most important responsibility of the federal government, this week my colleagues in the House and Senate voted to end President Trumps national emergency declaration that gives him the critical tools and latitude needed to do what House Democrats won't: secure our southern border."
"I have always maintained that the situation at our southern border is a crisis, and that the President has clear legal authority to declare a national emergency, just as previous presidents have done over 50 times before him."
"Unfortunately, this resolution is just the latest episode in Congressional abdication and Democrats endless obstruction of this Presidents border security policies, which are already having a significant impact with a nearly 60% decline in illegal border crossings since May."
"While this vote is a step backward in protecting the sovereignty of our nation and keeping our communities safe, I am confident that, just as we saw last time, President Trump will have the support in Congress needed to sustain his veto."

                     Home  Our District  About Member                  Dear Friends-  The last legislative week of September was overshadowed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.
"This latest effort by lawmakers to remove President Trump from office undermines our ability to address the real challenges that face American families and businesseschallenges like the spiraling cost of healthcare, securing our border, and strengthening and growing our trade relationships with international partners."
Time spent on impeachment is time not spent on the things that have a real effect on the lives of Ohioans.
"I will continue to fight for things like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which should enjoy a bipartisan majority of support."
"Hopefully, Speaker Pelosi will bring it before the House so that we can pass it and reap the economic rewards of the agreement."
"SAFE Banking Act         Congressman Davidson discusses the SAFE Banking Act on the House floor      On a more positive note, we had a small, but important bipartisan victory in the House this week with passage of the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act (H.R.1595)."
Rep. Steve Stivers (OH) and I joined as lead cosponsors of this bill with Democrat Reps. Ed Perlmutter (CO) and Rep. Denny Heck (WA).
"Banks in the United States should never be told to whom they can and cannot offer their services, especially when it interferes with lawful commerce."
"In 2013, the Department of Justice launched an initiative known as Operation Choke Point, which aimed to investigate U.S. banks that did business with companies that were believed to be at higher risk for fraud and money laundering."
"By doing this, the Obama-era Justice Department investigated and pressured banks on who they should and should not bank."
Operation Choke Point harmed law-abiding firearms manufacturers and sellers.
No federal regulator should block Americans lawful access to the financial system.
"The SAFE Banking Act defends civil liberties, and I am hopeful that the Senate will be able to pass this bill."
This Week in Committee     It was also a busy week in the Financial Services Committee.
"Capital formation was a prominent theme, and we discussed ensuring equal opportunity to financial gain for small businesses and tech startups, which are critical for the future of American innovation."
"My bill, The Token Taxonomy Act, would create a clear regulatory framework for blockchain startups."
The Token Taxonomy Act would help to truly make America a land of opportunity for the new generation of businesses in the technology sector.
"By creating a standard set of rules and regulation for this emerging industry, this legislation would pave an avenue for growth and innovation for generations to come."
"In the same hearing with SEC commissioners, I also had the opportunity to discuss the privacy and protection of consumers personal identifiable information (PII)."
"It is vital that we safeguard market data during electronic transactions, such as purchases from an online retailer."
These safeguards must be in place to protect every Americans personal information from hackers across the web.
I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect your consumer information.
Thank you for taking the time to keep up with the work I am doing on your behalf in Washington and at home in Ohio.

Internships are a great way to learn firsthand about the legislative process and how congressional offices serve constituents.
Applications for this spring are due by November 1.
"This week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Trump  but her announcement changed nothing."
Below is my full statement on her announcement.
"The Debbie Smith Act provides funding to help address the backlog of DNA evidence in criminal investigations, which is essential to secure convictions in rape and sexual assault cases."
"This law has a 15-year history of nearly unanimous support in Congress, under both Republican and Democratic majorities and presidents."
The funding expires in days.
I called on the House to immediately consider the bill to reauthorize the funding.
"On Wednesday, I joined Chris Berg on Point of View to discuss the impeachment announcement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), prescription drug pricing, and several other issues."
"The full video of our segment is below, and I encourage you to watch our full conversation."
"President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to a new trade deal that will open new markets for $7 billion in U.S. agricultural products, including wheat."
This is great news for North Dakota producers as Japan is one of the top export markets for North Dakota wheat.

"Statement on Speaker Pelosis Announcement  Speaker Pelosis statement makes a good headline, but it changes nothing."
Formal impeachment can only start after receiving 218 votes on the floor of the U.S. house.
"Instead of working to pass USMCA, fix our broken immigration system, and reduce drug prices, House Democrats continue to delegitimize a duly elected President and pass partisan bills that have no chance of becoming law."
The Debbie Smith Act The Debbie Smith Act provides funding to examine DNA evidence in criminal investigations.
The funding is primarily used to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits.
It has a 15-year history of nearly unanimous support in Congress.
"So, why is it being used as a political bargaining chip this year?"
"Watch my speech on the House floor this week:     Point of View with Chris Berg On Wednesday, I joined Chris Berg on Point of View to discuss impeachment, the Debbie Smith Act, USMCA, and all of the developments out of Washington this week."
Watch the clip below:     New U.S.-Japanese Trade Agreement   A new trade agreement with Japan signed this week opens new markets for $7 billion in U.S. agricultural products.
JapanesePrime MinisterShinzo Abe and President Trump announced the deal this week at the United Nations.
"The agreement lowers or eliminates tariffs on a variety of agricultural products important to North Dakota, including beef, wheat, and potatoes."
"It also includes preferential market access through the creation of country-specific quotas, which provide access for a specified quantity of imports from the United States at a preferential tariff rate, generally zero."
"The United States and Japan also struck an agreement on digital trade that prohibits tariffs on digital products like videos, music, e-books, software, and games that are transmitted electronically."
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the digital provisions meet the gold standard on digital trade rules set by the USMCA.
"According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is potentially the first step in a broader trade agreement between the two countries."
The agreement was praised by North Dakota Grain Growers Association and North Dakota Stockmans Association.
"Japan is a top importer of North Dakota wheat, so this deal could have a very positive impact on our markets, said NDGGA President Jeff Mertz."
"This new deal will give our domestic beef industry more leverage and a level playing field with our competitors so we can expand our market share in Japan, said NDSA President Dan Rorvig."
Photos of the Week  Several North Dakota sheriffs were in DC this week for an event on border security.
"They stopped by my office, where we talked about fighting the opioid epidemic, criminal justice reform, securing the border, and immigration reform."

--   We need to pass USMCA.
The trade deal puts North Dakota producers on a level playing field with Canada and Mexico.
It's time to get this done.

"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                       September 27, 2019  This week saw the explosive details of the whistleblower complaint regarding President Trumps shakedown of the President of Ukraine in exchange for political dirt on his opponent made public and the investigation into that matter, and impeachment proceedings, took center stage as my Democratic colleagues and I work to get to the bottom of the criminal and corrupt actions of this President."
"That included the House and Senate passing a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the whistleblower complaint regarding the Presidents shakedown of the President of Ukraine in exchange for political dirt on one of his opponents should be immediately transmitted to the House and Senate intelligence committees, as required by law."
"My fellow House Intelligence Committee Members and I also questioned Acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire at length about his handling of the report, including his inexplicable decision to take the whistleblowers credible, urgent, and good-faith complaint to the White House  the very entity that was the subject of the complaint  for their input on what he should do."
"DNI Maguire was unable to answer my questions about senior White House officials moving records of the call between President Trump and the President Zelenskyy into a system which is intended to hide our nations most secret information, not criminal behavior."
"Rest assured that my colleagues and I will reconvene next week  despite the September recess  for further investigation and to fulfil our sworn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic .I was also proud to vote for a series of immigration bills to address the humanitarian crisis at our southern border and this Administrations cruel and ineffective immigration policy."
I also voted to allow marijuana businesses operating legally in 47 states and the District of Columbia to have access to banking institutions.
"And this marked the second year that I have had the honor of hosting the release of the DEF CON Voting Village report, detailing election security vulnerabilities and failures."

Votes and Legislative Highlights Voted in favor of Resolution Expressing the Sense of Congress that the Whistleblower Complaint Should be Transmitted Immediately to the Intelligence Committees I was proud to join my colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee in voting for a resolution affirming that the whistleblower complaint should be shared with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.
"The resolution passed the House with 421 votes, with no Members voting against, and was supported unanimously in the Senate."
"Voted for Immigration Bills to Address the Humanitarian Crisis at Our Border This week, the House considered a series of immigration bills that would protect migrants in immigration facilities and end the Presidents sham emergency declaration."
I was proud to vote for H.R.
"3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act, which would require Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to take seriously migrant health, and H.R."
"2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act, which would strengthen child protection policies and establish advisory and investigative bodies."
Recent reports of shameful conditions for women and children in border facilities highlight the urgency of passing legislation to ensure that migrants in the care of the U.S. are treated humanely.
The House also voted for the second time to end this Presidents shameful attempt to circumvent congressional authority by declaring a national emergency to fund his vanity wall.
"Unfortunately, the President will likely veto this resolution a second time."
My colleagues and I will continue to fight the Presidents reprehensible anti-immigrant policies.
"Passed Bill to Open Up Banking Services for Legitimate Marijuana Businesses This Wednesday, I voted for and the House-passedSecure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act."
"This legislation, which passed by a bipartisan vote of 321-103, would provide legal marijuana businesses with access to banking services, such as checking accounts and payment processing."
Federal law is way behind in responding to the legalization movement in many states.
"Today, 47 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use."
"California is the worldwide leader in this budding industry, with an anticipated $3 billion in legal sales this year."
"These businesses are operating legally at the state level, yet they have been barred from accessing the banking system and have had to resort to dealing entirely in cash, which is cumbersome and extremely insecure."
The SAFE Banking Act will help dispel the legal cloud hanging over these legitimate businesses and enable their continued growth.
Questioned Acting DNI on Handling of Explosive Whistleblower Complaint  Other Members of the Committee and I pressed Mr. Maguire on why he illegally held back from the congressional intelligence committees a grave and urgent whistleblower complaint detailing the Presidents treacherous scheme.
"I also expressed my extreme concern to Mr. Maguire that he took this credible, urgent, and good-faith complaint first to the White House, the very entity that was the subject of the complaint, for their input on whether to share it with Congress, which is required by law."
"And DNI Maguire was unable to answer my questions about disturbing allegations that senior White House officials moved records of a call between Trump and the President of Ukraine into a system which is intended to hide our nations most secret information, not criminal behavior."
This attempted cover-up would have succeeded were it not for the bravery and dedication of the courageous whistleblower.
"The House Intelligence Committee is investigating these criminal and corrupt acts and has made this declassified, redacted complaint public."
"Spoke at Press Conference on PFAS Contamination in California On Thursday, I joined several of my colleagues in holding a press conference to highlight the Environmental Working Groups blistering new report on PFAS contamination in California."
"According to the report, more than 7.5 million Californians are at risk of PFAS contamination through 74 impacted water systems in the state."
"Forty percent of these sites have, on at least one occasion, registered PFAS levels above the EPAs lifetime health advisory of 70 parts per trillion."
"As the EWG report demonstrates, were facing a dire public health threat from the contamination of water, food, and air supplies by PFAS chemicals."
"The EPA set a nonbinding lifetime health advisory of 70 ppt for PFAS, but this threshold does not take into account multiple studies that show adverse health impacts at much lower levels."
Many states have drawn upon these studies to set limits that are seven times lower.
Im deeply concerned that our regulatory agencies are failing to adequately protect the American people.
Congress cannot continue to be asleep at the switchboard.
"It must act swiftly to require health protective standards, regular monitoring of at-risk water sources, and filtration of PFAS-contaminated drinking water."
It must also ensure that entitiessuch as the Department of Defense work with PFAS manufacturers to clean up contaminated ground water that impacts communities in the vicinity of contamination sites.
"The press conference highlighted PFAS provisions included in the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), including an amendment to classify PFAS as a hazardous substance."
"As we work toward a final NDAA, I will fight to retain these critical protections."
"Hosted Release of DEF CON Voting Village Report on Election Security On Wednesday, I once again hosted the DEF CON Voting Village at the Capitol as they debuted their report detailing the vulnerabilities discovered at this years annual hacking experiment of voting equipment used across America."
I was joined by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Congressman John Katko (R-NY) in expressing the urgency of this issue for all Americans and the importance of Congressional attention and action.
"The conference revealed numerous frightening vulnerabilities in our election security systems including:Passwords for a model of touch-screen voting machines used in 27 states in 2018 could be discovered through a basic internet search.A type of voting machine used in the 2018 election was running 15-year-old software with many known vulnerabilities.Official election equipment, including a voter ID check-in machine with no Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)password, was hacked to display memes and video games instead of running elections.An optical scanner used in 23 states in 2018 could be made to count additional votes after the close of the election."
So many have fought so hard for each of us to have a say in what kind of government we have.
We cannot afford to have that right stolen from us by invisible forces controlled by hostile foreign governments.
"Congress must do everything it can to prevent interference in our elections, including attempts to hack our voting systems and equipment."

"Met with the California Credit Union League On Wednesday, I met with representatives of the California Credit Union League."
"I have been a strong supporter of credit unions, most recently leading a letter in support of a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act that would prevent military installations from giving rent-free office space to for-profit banks."
"At the meeting, we discussed pressing issues affecting credit unions and their customers."
That includes lax data protection standards on retailers and payment processors that put customers personal information at risk and a disparity in the law that prohibits federal credit unions from offering long-term loan products that are easily available at state credit unions and for-profit banks.
Voices of Californias 14th District  Here are some issues raised this week: 191 constituents expressed support for the opening of an impeachment inquiry.
President Trump has tried time and time again to recruit foreign powers to meddle in our elections.
I support Speaker Pelosis decision to open an impeachment inquiry.
"In the United States, nobody is above the law and I am committed to following the facts and will do everything in my power to hold the President accountable for his corruption."
118 constituents shared their support for H.R.
"2245, the Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large Animal Trophies (CECIL) Act of 2019."
This bill would amend the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to treat species that are proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered to also be treated as such for trophy hunting purposes.
It would also require that any new wildlife imports to the U.S. enhance the conservation of the species.
"As a member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, I believe we have a responsibility to safeguard our wildlife, preserve their habitats, and protect our public lands and I will support this bill if it reaches the House floor."
105 constituents expressed their support for H.R.
"230, the Ban Toxic Pesticides Act of 2019, which would ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and prohibit any future registration of the pesticide."
 News from Representative Brindisi                                       Hi everyone - GREAT NEWS!
Our Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2019 passed the House and the Senate and is on its way to the President's desk to be signed into law!
We worked withRepublican Representative Mike Bostto preserve critical programs that serve Veterans such as loans for low-income Veterans and transportation to vet centers for highly rural Veterans.
"Without action, these programs will expire at the end of the month."
Washington cannot play political games with Veterans care.
"UDDERLY RIDICULOUS: Flavored milk, like chocolate and strawberry, helps kids get vital nutrients including calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, but New York City is considering a plan to ban flavored milk from schools."
Studies show that reducing or eliminating the availability of flavored milk in schools has led to overall decreased milk consumption.
"For some families, the meals children receive in schools are their only source of recommended nutrients."
I joined local dairy farmers andelected officials to call on NYC to stop this misguided proposal.
Im standing with Upstate farmers to tell NYC to MOOOOve it along and keep flavored milk in schools.
"IN CASE OF EMERGENCY: In rural communities, response time for ambulances and emergency services are crucial, because in life or death situations, every second counts."
"I was proud to announce funding for a new ambulance to serve Madison County, helping save lives and ensure care is there when its needed most."
I will never stop fighting for resources to ensure our rural communities have access to health care.
FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC: Our communities have been ripped apart by the opioid epidemic.
"Oswego County recently received a new designation from the Office of National Drug Control Policy, bringing much needed federal assistance to the brave local law enforcement working in the streets every day."
I was proud to support the Countys effort.
Congress must act to stop the flow of illegal drugs into our communities.

BIPARTISAN TECH TALK: I joinedCongressman John Katkoat theNUAIRUnmanned Aerial Systems Symposium to talk about how we can support Upstate innovation and the UAV industry.
"From helping farmers be more efficient and productive to strengthening the work at Rome Lab, UAV technology is one way we can invest in the future ofNY-22."
HARD TIMES FOR HARDWOOD: Upstate hardwood producers are feeling the effects of the trade dispute with China.
I spoke with Matthew Gutchess ofCortlands Gutchess Lumber and owners of other NY hardwood facilities about ways we can help them get through these hard times.
We need to find commonsense solutions that holds China accountable and gets a fair deal for our workers and producers    THANKS FOR VISITING: Great to see the Mexico Academy and Central School District JROTC while they were in Washington.
Im so impressed by their hard work and dedication.

"Energy Production Means Energy Security On Saturday, September 14, explosions rocked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia."
"Attention quickly turned to Iran as the culprit behind the blasts, which cut Saudi oil production in half at the time."
Possible conflict between two of the Middle Easts major powers is a big news story.
"In another era, it would capture even more attention in the United States."
"Fortunately, technological innovation and smart energy policies have provided us with a measure of protection from these incidents."
Great strides in energy independence mean we are no longer so captive to events in the often-volatile Middle East.
"If you were alive in the 1970s, you likely recall the energy crises consumers faced here, caused in part by Middle Eastern politics and production challenges in the United States."
You may remember cars waiting in long lines for gasoline (I remember only being able to refuel my mothers car on certain days of the week based on my license plate number) or President Carter asking Americans to turn down their thermostats in winter.
"In 2011, as the nationwide average gas price hovered around $4 a gallon, President Obama said, We cant just drill our way out of the problem."
"Yet today, as AAA lists the national average gas price as $2.667 on September 23, we can see that domestic drilling did help solve the problem."
"Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration indicate that in 2018, the United States was the worlds leading oil producer at 17.87 million barrels a day, 18 percent of the worlds total."
Saudi Arabia followed with 12.42 million barrels per day and a 12 percent share of total world production.
We are not just powering our own country through oil production; we are powering the world.
"As a CNN article noted only two days before the attack on the Saudi oil facilities, the United States in June overtook Saudi Arabia and Russia as the worlds top oil exporter."
"Although Saudi Arabia reclaimed the top spot for the next two months, we are in contention."
Oil is far from our only asset in energy.
The United States hit a record high in natural gas production in 2018 and was a net exporter for the second year in a row.
"Before 2017, our country had not been a natural gas net exporter since 1957."
"Because America did not follow Democrats down that path and instead focused on developing domestic sources of energy, we are much more secure from the shocks of the worldwide energy market."
Good energy policy also requires us not to rest on our laurels.
Research and development allow us to find new potential sources of energy as well as get more out of the energy resources we already use.
Allowing domestic energy production to flourish and devoting resources to research have important implications in Virginias Ninth Congressional District as well as nationally.
All of the above energy policies supporting production mean the Federal Government does not smother coal under blankets of regulation.
We saw the consequences of this during the Obama Administration.
"In contrast, I have championed, and the Trump Administration has implemented, the lifting of burdensome regulations from coal production."
"Although low natural gas prices have hindered coals resurgence, it remains a source of energy both domestically and internationally."
I have also supported domestic energy in the Ninth District through legislative efforts to streamline and accelerate licensing for hydroelectric projects and federal funding through the Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program to build solar installations.
"Research and development, including exciting projects at Virginia Tech, allow us to use more of what we already have in Southwest Virginia."
"For example, it has the potential to find new uses for coal."
"I believe that without the right energy policies, the shock to the U.S. energy market of the attacks in Saudi Arabia would have been much more severe, with serious consequences for our national security as well as consumer pocketbooks."
Democrats in Congress nevertheless advocate policies that would restore hurdles to domestic energy production.
Their Green New Deal would entirely suppress many of the energy sources that have propelled America to energy dominance.
The benefits of the energy self-sufficiency we enjoy today remind us why we should reject such an approach.
Energy production in the United States has strengthened our security as well as our economy.

"Congressman Bruce Westerman, Representing the 4th District of Arkansas Greetings!"
"I spend quite a bit of time driving across Arkansas, and I've seen the condition of rural roads in the district gradually worsen over recent years."
"Unsafe rural roads take away one's peace of mind when commuting to work, visiting family and friends or even driving to the grocery store."
"No one should have to worry about the safety of themselves or loved ones just because our roads are falling apart, especially when the road that is crumbling may be the only route to take."
That's why I introduced the *Rural Road Safety Act* with Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer (D-Iowa) on Monday.
This bipartisan bill would restore a funding program for rural roads that was taken away and used elsewhere - we want to give this money back to communities so they can make critical safety improvements.
"Modernizing infrastructure in the Fourth District of Arkansas and across the country is one of my top priorities, and I am glad to join Rep. Finkenauer in cosponsoring this bill."
You can read more about the *Rural Road Safety Act* here [link 1].
"The rest of this week was spent in committee hearings, meetings with constituents, a Capitol night tour and a celebrity face you might recognize."
I am excited to share more with you in the sections below.

       An update from Congressman Ken Calvert                 About Ken  Issues  Contact Me                     Keeping Bias Out of Big Tech      How Americans get information is constantly and rapidly evolving.
Advances in both our electronic devices and the programs/apps that run on them provide ever-expanding communication possibilities and also potential dangers.
"As a select number of big tech firms control an increasing amount of these platforms, they have become the gatekeepers to the information we consume."
"For decades we have had regulatory policies in place addressing the ownership and broadcasts of television and radio communications.Americans have a personal responsibility to fully understand the information they share and receive, and understand the context of those exchanges."
"However,I also believe it is critical that we have safeguards in place to protect the public from both intended and unintended bias by big tech companies."
"In a Senate hearing earlier this year, a psychology professor highlighted the potential risk to the integrity of our elections if we allow big tech to operate without proper oversight."
"#NoEnergyWeek   Last week, House Democrats celebrated #NoEnergyWeek by passing bills that will shut down domestic energy production in regions across the United States."
These policies will result in:   Reduced American energy production Higher costs for families and businesses Fewer jobs Greater dependence on energy from foreign nations with poor environmental and humanitarian standards Lost energy production royalty revenues for states and the federal government  Riverside County commuters spend a great deal of their time and money driving to and from work.
Higher gas prices reduce the amount of money families have to spend on other items in their budgets.
"I voted against these misguided bills and will continue to fight for energy policies that help, not hurt, Riverside County families."

"                              September 17, 2019     Dear Friends,  Congress is back in session, and Democrats wasted no time jumping straight into another week focused on attacking this president."
"Last Thursday, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee held a markup to consider procedures for conducting an impeachment proceeding."
"The problem is, Democrats cant seem to decide whether they are in fact pursuing impeachment."
The ambiguity is nothing more than a product of my Democrat colleagues own making.
Theres an easy way to figure out exactly whether the House Judiciary Committee is in impeachment proceedings: Its called a votea vote of the full House of Representatives.
"Until there is a vote on the House floor, Congress is not pursuing impeachmentno matter what you may hear from the Democratic majority."
I joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business last week to discuss why Democrats should stop wasting time on desperate investigations and start working on issues affecting every day Americans.
"Click here or on the image above to watch   Protecting Our Second Amendment Rights Last week, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee passed three bills to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rightsnone of which would have prevented the mass shootings devastating our country."
"These bills are dangerous not only because they punish responsible gun owners, but because Democrats are offering people a false sense of security."
"As Ive said many times, what makes you feel good doesnt always heal you."
The worst thing we can do for people who are grieving or scared is to give them false hope.
"Back in February, I introduced the Mass Violence Prevention (MVP) Act to prevent firearm violence while protecting our Second Amendment rights."
This bill would have addressed factors in recent mass shootings by giving law enforcement the resources they need to respond to potential violence before it happens.
"It would also help prevent criminals from getting their hands on guns by increasing penalties for burglary of federal firearms licensees, therefore curbing the supply of guns going into the black market."
"For seven months now, the MVP Act has been on the Democrats desk, but they refuse to bring it to the Committee for a vote."
"To watch my remarks at the House Judiciary Committees markup last week, click here or on the image below."
"Competition in the Tech Sector Earlier this year, the House Judiciary Committee opened a bipartisan investigation into the relationship between big tech and market competition."
"On Friday, we issued formal document requests and other requests for information from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet Inc., and Facebook about their business practices."
"This information is key to determining whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues, and whether we need to modernize our antitrust laws in order to better promote competition in the tech sector."
"Our reasons for making these requests arent the same for each company, and our concerns with each companys practices also vary in scale."
"On Friday, I joined CNBCs Squawk Box to provide an update on our investigation."

"           News from Representative Gonzalez                              ABOUT CONSTITUENT SERVICES ISSUES  LEGISLATION NEWSROOM       September 15, 2019   Dear Friend, My number one goal as your representative is to empower Northeast Ohios economy, bring jobs to our area and make our region a destination for young families and small businesses."
Part of achieving that is ensuring that we are promoting our strengths as a community to industries that are expanding and looking for new locations to call home.
Last week I took a group of business and university leaders from our area out to Silicon Valley to do just that.
"Together, we met with venture capitalists, startups and leaders in the technology and cryptocurrency fields to promote the strengths of Northeast Ohio and make our case for why they should look to us as they make decisions on where to expand their businesses."
Northeast Ohio has everything we need to thrive in the innovation economy and software space.
"We have incredible universities training our students for the jobs of the future, we have good infrastructure and low housing costs, and we have advantages no one else has in the strength of our manufacturing and health care industries."
But these jobs wont just appear  we have to go out and get them.
I look forward to continuing to work with business and industry leaders here in Northeast Ohio to make our case to the country and the world.

"Thank you to World War II Veteran Richard Masin This week I released another #TVT, or Thank-a-Vet Thursday video featuring U.S. Navy Veteran Richard Masin who served in the South Pacific during World War II."
The video is part of a longer interview that will be preserved in American history as part of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project.
Richard enlisted in the Navy after graduating from high school at age 17 and served three years of active duty from 1943  1946.
"During his time in the Navy, Richard earned his shellback crossing the equator on December 24, 1943 as part of the crew for the USS Alnitah, a cargo ship that transported troops and supplies throughout the Pacific theater from January 1944 to late July 1945."
"For his service, Richard was awarded the Asiatic Pacific Medal, American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and Navy Good Conduct Medal."
Listen to Richards story here.
Bringing a piece of the NFL to the financial services industry On Tuesday I had the privilege of speaking on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in support of H.R.
"281, the Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act of 2019 introduced by fellow Ohioan Rep. Joyce Beatty."
"This bill, also known as the Beatty Rule, seeks to capture the success of the Rooney Rule in the NFL and implement a similar rule for Regional Federal Reserve Banks when interviewing for a new president."
"By providing the opportunity to be interviewed and showcase their individual talents, this legislation will open more doors for individuals from a diverse background while still being based on merit."
"As a former NFL player, I consider myself a direct beneficiary of the Rooney Rule."
"Over my five seasons, I was blessed with the opportunity to be coached by two African American men who I consider to be some of the greatest leaders I have ever encountered."
"From 1921-2003, professional football had 7 minority head coaches."
"Once the Rooney Rule was instituted, the NFL has seen 18 minority head coaches."
I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues on this important issue and thank and congratulate Ms. Beatty for her work on this legislation.

" A Message FromCongressman Peter DeFazio   Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email                      Update from Congressman Peter DeFazio  Dear Friends,  I had an enjoyable summer, traveling the Fourth Congressional District and meeting with many of you to discuss issues of great importance to the community."
Heres an update on my visits throughout Southwest Oregon in August.
"Transportation, Jobs, and the Economy on the South Coast  I held a number of town hall meetings and took several tours on the south coast focused on infrastructure."
"Im happy to report that the projects Ive helped secure funding for are moving forward quickly, including the $6.5 million rehabilitation of Port Orfords failed breakwater and more than $10.2 million in projects at Southwest Oregon Regional Airport."
"In addition, the harbors in Brookings, Coos Bay, Bandon, Gold Beach, Florence, and Reedsport are being dredged thanks to funding I helped secure from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)."
Congressman DeFazio touring the Port Orford breakwater rehabilitation project.
"At the town hall meetings I brought together regional leaders from the U.S. Coast Guard, the Corps, and the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to discuss needs and investments planned on the Southern Coast."
Coast Guard Sector North Bend Commander Olav Saboe thanked the community for their support of Coasties during the government shutdown.
"Oregon has more than 1,200 Coast Guard active duty, reservists, and civilian employees, all of whom went unpaid during the government shutdown, which lasted for 35 days."
The Coast Guard was the only branch of the armed services that wasnt paid during the shutdown.
"Thats why I introduced and passed out of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which I chair, H.R."
"367, the Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act of 2019."
"This bill ensures that in the event of a lapse of appropriations, Coast Guard service members and employees will continue receiving their paychecks if the rest of the military is paid."
Portland District Commander Colonel Aaron Dorf focused on the role the Corps plays in dredging our ports and harbors and maintaining the jetties that protect them.
We discussed shoaling issues along the Rogue River and the need for consistent dredging at area ports.
"This fall, I expect the House to vote on my bill, H.R."
"2440, the Unlocking the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act of 2019."
This legislation will help ensure Congress spends revenues collected by the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund on their intended purposes: maintaining our ports and harbors.
"Frank Reading, ODOTs Southern Oregon Region Manager, discussed the projects ODOT is working on in Southwest Oregon including the urgent repairs following the Hooskanaden slide."
"I have worked with ODOT to secure federal funding to repair the slide immediately while ODOT studies the costs and challenges of a new bridge, re-routing the highway, and improving the existing detour route."
"Back in Washington, I remain laser-focused on improving our infrastructure."
"In addition to the legislation I mentioned above, I am working on a surface transportation reauthorization to bring our roads, bridges, and transit systems up to a state of good repair and stop the self-defeating cycle of underinvestment that has been in place for the past 20 years."
"Renewable Hydrogen: A Tool to Reduce Carbon Emissions  In early August I held a roundtable to raise awareness of the potential for renewable hydrogen to power parts of our transportation system, maximize the efficiency of renewable energy production, and make our communities more resilient during natural disasters, all while significantly lowering carbon emissions."
"I brought together utilities, a major car manufacturer, energy entrepreneurs, and nonprofits dedicated to fighting climate change through substantive policy."
Congressman DeFazio hosting a roundtable focused on integrating renewable hydrogen with wind and solarto powervehicles and utilities.
"Hydrogen is a clean fuel that can power cars, buses, trains, ships, and even electric utilities while only emitting water vapor as a byproduct."
"To produce this hydrogen, electricity is used to split or crack water into hydrogen and oxygen."
"When that electricity comes from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, then we have a revolutionary fuel that could potentially meet significant amounts of energy needs without any carbon emissions."
"The Pacific Northwest has abundant solar and wind power generation, but there are times when the sun doesnt shine, and the wind doesnt blow."
Storing renewably-generated electricity is crucial to getting our country on a path to a 100percentrenewable energy future.
"By using renewable electricity to convert water in to hydrogen, we can store hydrogen fuel in fuel cells that can generate power when we need it."
An increasing number of utilities and companies are incorporating hydrogen fuel into their portfolios and long-term business plans.
"At the roundtable, Toyota brought its hydrogen fuel cell-powered Mirai passenger car."
Tech start-up Hydrostar brought a demonstration of a low cost electrolyzer that can use renewable energy to create 100 percent renewable hydrogen.
The Eugene Water and Electric Board is looking at innovative plans to use hydrogen to store surplus renewable energy as emergency backup power during natural disasters.
California is nurturing the use of hydrogen fuel-powered vehicles by co-funding hydrogen refueling stations.
"There are now more than 30 hydrogen fueling stations powering the more than 4,200 hydrogen fuel cars in the state."
"The federal government must play a role in propelling the growth of hydrogen fuel technologies, which have already proven its benefits."
"Like wind and solar, the federal government can provide various tools to help this technology reach economies of scale, reduce its price, and make it more available to the public."
"As Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am working to create a 21st Century transportation bill where renewable energy, including hydrogen, will play a major role."
" News from Representative Cisneros                                                        September 12, 2019  Dear Lindsey,  A lot has happened during August recess and I wanted to update you on everything that has been going on in the 39th District."

"Visited of Yamaha, Special Equipment Market Association (SEMA), andTAWA Supermarket I had a chance to tour the Yamaha Corporation of America facility and try out some of the instruments they provide for California and across the nation (picture below)."
We had a great discussion the economic impact of Yamaha's instruments in the U.S. economy.
"Yamaha also highlighted their advocacy for STEAM education in our district, ensuring the arts are prioritized at school."
It was a pleasure to tour SEMA in Diamond Bar to learn more about their programs and products that enhance Motorsports throughout the world.
Their organization not only supports our local economy in the 39th District but provides services to manufacturers and consumers to promote innovation in this industry.

"Visited Businesses Made in the 39th   Rep. Cisneros taking a tour of Hydraflows warehouse to learn about their small business and defense projects (left) and receiving a demo of Stratvocate, which helps manufacturers gain insights on national security projects (right)."
I met with Strategy Advocates to learn about their online business intelligence tools aimed at supporting national security related projects.
"Then, I hosted a roundtable discussion at Hydraflow, which included other local aerospace manufacturers and supplier companies such as Pacmin, Ejays Machine, Aero Pacific, Aerofab Corporation, APV Manufacturing, Coast Aerospace, and AiReps."
"All these companies are promoting numerous technological innovations, from building cybersecurity software solutions to developing and manufacturing products for aerospace clients."
Each of our roundtable participants has a unique role in contributing to the economic health of our district.
We must continue to maintain a business and community environment that supports and attracts companies as well as creates more jobs for our constituents.
Rep. Cisneros receiving a presentation of Raytheons projects aiding our cybersecurity efforts (left) and presenting a certificate of recognition to Collins Aerospace in Brea recognizing their commitment to air travel safety (right).
"I also met with Raytheon to discuss their work related to defense, civil government, and cybersecurity solutions."
"Then, we toured Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC), to learn more about their key programs supporting our national defense and space operations."
"It was an honor to meet with Raytheon and United Technologies Corporation, who are both pushing the boundaries of aerospace research and development in the 39th District."
"                                          September 11, 2019 Doyle E-Newsletter #89                 District Work Period Report  Dear Friend:  The House of Representatives just wrapped up its August district work period  thats a time when the House is in recess so that Members of Congress can meet with their constituents to learn more about local concerns and let them know whats been going on in Congress."
"I had a number of meetings in and around Pittsburgh over the district work period, and I wanted to share some of the highlights with you."
Neighborhood Night Out  I attended the Primary Care Health Services Patient Appreciation and National Night Out Celebration held at the Alma Illery Medical Center in Homewood.
"It gave me a chance to catch up with some constituents from Homewood and express my support for federally funded Community Health Centers, which provide health care services to all comers regardless of their ability to pay."
"The federal government currently provides roughly $5.5 billion a year to support the nations 10,000 Community Health Centers, which serve roughly 25 million people annually."
Most funding for Community Health Centers will expire if Congress doesnt act to reauthorize it by September 30.
Saw Mill Run Creek  Flooding has long been an issue along Saw Mill Run.
"Several years ago, I worked successfully to have the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers address this flooding."
"That work improved the situation, but more still needs to be done to fix the problem."
"Many homes along Saw Mill Run Creek flooded last summer, and its only a matter of time before these properties are flooded and damaged again."
I wrote to President Trump last summer asking that he declare Pennsylvania a major disaster area due to the destructive floods and landslides we experienced.
Such a declaration releases federal assistance for the affected communities.
"Governor Wolf requested it as well, but our requests were denied."
"This August, I met with State Representative Dan Deasy, representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith, and other City of Pittsburgh officials to discuss options for preventing future flooding in the West End."
This meeting was successful in bringing all of the stakeholders together to come up with a plan for action.
"As a result of this meeting, the City removed a lot of debris from Saw Mill Run Creek in late August  and the City and the Army Corps of Engineers are looking at how to best move forward with long term efforts to prevent flooding along Saw Mill Run Creek."
"I will continue to press for Corps action on this flooding problem, and I am optimistic that we can reduce flood damage along Saw Mill Run Creek."
"Hawkins Village I led a tour of Hawkins Village with Michelle Kenney, Antwon Roses mother."
"I invited a number of local officials and representatives from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to see the neighborhood and discuss the concerns that the residents of the community have about issues like maintenance, public safety, and re-establishing a tenant council so residents would have greater input into management decisions."
Climate Change Town Hall  I believe that climate change is the most pressing issue facing our nation.
"If the United States and other big industrial countries around the world dont reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the coming years, average global temperatures will rise significantly - with disastrous results."
I held a town hall meeting on Climate Change in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum in August to help raise public awareness about the issue.
"A panel of experts shared their knowledge about existing technologies that could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and around the world."
A second panel addressed the challenges of securing government action to promote the adoption of such environmentally sustainable energy technology.
"I followed up with a brief summary ofCongressional action to address climate change, and the evening ended with those of us on stage answering questions from the audience."
Ive been working with my Democratic colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee toput togethera bill that would result in no net U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050.
"We are currently holding a number of hearings on climate change-related issues, and we will continue work on the bill."
"AlphaLab  I also had the opportunity to visit AlphaLab, a Pittsburgh-based organization that helps people with interesting ideas for new products or services ""start up"" new businesses around their ideas.AlphaLab helps such start-ups develop business plans, find funding sources, work outlegal issues,and get their businesses up and running."
"At AlphaLab, Imet with a number of its clients in order to learn more about what goes on there  as well as the challenges their businesses are facing and what role the federal government can play inhelping new businesses get off the ground."
"One of my top priorities in Congress is helpingstart-ups succeed and create good new jobs -- all across the country, of course, but especially in Pittsburgh!"
Our region is home to a number of companies that have taken some research done at local universities and built successful businesses around it.
Such start-ups are responsible for a lot of the economic revitalization Pittsburgh has experienced over the last 20 or 30 years.
"I have been a vocal, effective advocate throughout my service in Congress for increased investments in scientific and medical research, and I have been working with House Democrats on a range of policies to help entrepreneurs bridge the gap between theconcept for a product and acompany that's actually open for business."
"Wood Street Towers Apartments  I also had the opportunity over the district work period to meet with residents of Wood Street Towers Apartments, affordable senior housing in Wilkinsburg, to learn more about their needs and concerns, which fell primarily in the category of safety and security upgrades."
My staff is following up onsome residents' requests for help dealing with federal government agencies.
"Any constituent who wants help dealing with federal programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, income taxes, student loans, passports and visas should feel free to contact my office online, by phone, or in person."
"Baldwin Health Center  I also visited with the residents and staff of the Baldwin Health Center, a nursing home where some people stay for a short time while recovering from surgery or an illness - and where others who are no longer able to live on their own receive long-term care."
"Most older Americans will need long-term care at some point in their life  and as the number of older Americans increases in the coming years, the need for long term care will grow dramatically."
"For example, the number of Americans over age 85 - the individuals most likely to require nursing home care - will triple to nearly 90 million in the coming years."
"Because most nursing home residents rely on Medicare for their health insurance and on Medicaid to cover their long-term care expenses, talking to them about their experiences and concerns helps me represent them better in Congress."
"I serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over both Medicare and Medicaid, so I am in a good position to promote legislation to improve those programs so that they better serve the tens of millions of Americans who depend upon them."
"New Century Careers  Finally, I visited New Century Careers, an education and training organization on the South Side for workers in Pittsburgh who want manufacturing jobs."
"With more and more Baby Boomers retiring every day, local manufacturers face massive shortages of skilled workers in the months and years ahead."
It's essential for our region's future economic growth that local companies can find workers with the skills they need - and many Pittsburghers need the job skills that will make a good-paying career possible in the years to come.
"Organizations like New Century Careers, which receives support from the Commonwealth, foundations,and local businesses, addresses both critical issues."
"It provides free training to students that prepares them for paid apprenticeships, and then it places them in local manufacturing companies."
"Given the rapid technological changes in manufacturing today, our nation needs to do more to provide Americans with skills that will be in demand in the coming decades."
"That's especially true for our region, where much of our recent economic growth has been driven by companies in high-tech fields like robotics, computers, and medicine."
Throughout my service in Congress I have been working to expand and improve Americans' opportunities to get the education and training they need for a rewarding career and a decent standard of living.
I'm glad that goal is shared by many individuals and organizations in our region.
"Congress is back in session  The district work period has now ended, and the House is back in session."
"Much of September will be dedicated to completing the legislation funding the federal governments operations over the coming fiscal year, which begins on October 1."
I anticipate that many other issues will be addressed in the House this fall.

"Hosting My 14th Kansas Conservation Tour  On Tuesday, USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Chief Matt Lohr joined me in Brown, Doniphan, Atchison and Wyandotte counties to meet with farmers, ranchers and partners of our states agricultural and natural resource associations during my 14th Kansas Conservation Tour."
"The tour gives me and partners across Kansas the opportunity to learn more about ongoing conservation efforts across the state, including water and soil conservation, watershed protection and river sustainability."
"We began the day with a discussion on the Emergency Watershed Protection Program through the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), which allows communities to address damage to infrastructure and lands."
During this stop we saw how Brown County officials and NRCS are working together to reduce threats to life and property by stabilizing a damaged road caused by increased moisture across the region.
At the next stop we joined the Kansas Iowa Tribe and Chairman Tim Rhodd to learn more about the Tribes conservation efforts relating to their Tribal Soil Climate Analysis Network (TSCAN).
"Data from the TSCAN is used in a variety of ways to monitor drought development, predict changes in crop, range, and woodland productivity and predict regional shifts in irrigation water requirements."
This provides an invaluable level of information to farmers and ranchers and serves as a key component of the work done by producers of the tribe.
I appreciate Chairman Rhodd and Tribal leaders for joining this years tour and for their deep compassion in caring for the land.
"Our next visit was at HBJ Farms in Doniphan County, owned and operated by brothers Howard, Brad and Jason Taylor."
"Their operation was severely impacted by flooding this past spring, causing extensive damage and loss of production."
"During our visit, we heard from Kansas Farm Service Agency (FSA) Director David Schemm and producer John Taylor to discuss the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the assistance it has provided HBJ Farms during these difficult circumstances."
"After HBJ Farms, we joined Kansas commodities organizations to discuss the conservation title in the farm bill and the implementation of conservation practices for a sustainable future."
Thanks to leaders and staff of these commodity groups and organizations for their input on Tuesday and for all their work to assist producers.
"In Atchison County, we joined officials at Benedictine Bottoms, a protected area purchased under the authorization of Congress through the Mitigation Project in theWater Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986."
"At this stop we heard from Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWPT) and their management of three habitat types that include timber, native grass and wetlands."
These bottoms also serve as an area where excess flood waters can be held and prevent further damage downstream.
"We concluded the Conservation Tour with a stop in Wyandotte County at Kaw Point Park, where the Kansas River meets the Missouri River."
Here the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Nature Conservancy briefed us on their ongoing efforts to improve management through the Sustainable Rivers Program.
We also heard from The Conservation Fund who discussed how local governments and non-profit organizations have come together to form the Blue River Conservation Collaborative to help protect and preserve working lands and wildlife in the upper Blue River Watershed in Johnson County.
"We also heard from the KDWPT and their work to combat Aquatic Nuisance Species not native to Kansas that can threaten lake and river ecology, harm native or desirable species and interfere with our economy."
"A special thank you to NRCS Chief Matthew Lohr, Kansas NRCS State Conservationist Karen Woodrich and Kansas FSA Director David Schemm for joining me on this tour and to all who participated in my 14th Kansas Conservation Tour."
"World-Renowned Ocean Explorer Dr. Robert Ballard Speaks at Atchison High School  On Tuesday, it was a privilege to host Wichita native and world-renowned ocean explorer Dr. Bob Ballard in Atchison, Kansas."

"I then hosted Dr. Ballard and Admiral Gallaudet at Atchison High School, along with Atchison students and community members."
"Here, Dr. Ballard spoke on his ongoing expedition to find Earharts plane."
"During his presentation, Dr. Ballard called the crew of his ship, the Naultais, for a video chat where they discussed their mission and the methods by which theyre searching for the plane."
"A key component of Dr. Ballards work is to recruit and encourage young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)."
"Dr. Ballard and I discussed the importance of these careers to our world, and to the Kansas economy."
"Dr. Ballard spoke of his personal calling to discover Earharts plane, so her legacy can inspire young people to pursue careers in aviation and to break barriers in their careers."
Dr. Ballards expedition will air during a documentary titled Expedition Amelia on National Geographic on October 20.
Hosting Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy in Kansas  Fort Riley I was pleased to host Secretary of the U.S. Army Ryan McCarthy on Thursday at both Fort Riley and Wichita State University.
"Thursday morning, we started our day at Seitz Elementary School on Fort Riley."
"In 2011, I joined then-Secretary of the Army Robert Gates at Fort Riley for the groundbreaking of Seitz Elementary, and then Lt. Gen. Seitz to cut the ribbon on this school constructed in his honor."

"                  Home  Legislation  News                Dear Friend,  Last year, I sent a letter to search engine giant Google, challenging them to maintain proper protections for children's online privacy."
"I was inspired by twenty-three child and privacy advocacy groups, who, in April, 2018, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) arguing that Googles YouTube online video and advertising network systematically collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of children under the age of 13 and sold that data to marketers in violation of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)."
"This week, Google and its subsidiary YouTube agreed to pay a record $170 million to settle allegations that YouTube illegally collected personal data on children without parental consent."
"While a $170 million fine is a drop in the bucket to Google, it is ten times larger than all previous COPPA fines combined."
"To maintain its online search, advertising, and media dominance, Google collects vast amounts of data on our preferences, our friends preferences, and the sites we visit, while monitoring our daily conversations."
"By last measure, the market cap of Google was over $800 billion."
"To be fair, we agreed to Googles Faustian bargain: Our privacy in exchange for their promise of convenience."
"We did not, however, give Google permission to track and monetize our children."
Youd think that Google would implicitly understand this.
"It seems to be in the nature of monopolies chase for quarterly profit, however, to lose sight of protections for the people they are intending to serve."
This might be due to a fundamental misunderstanding of capitalism itself.
"In his signature book, The Wealth of Nations, the father of capitalism, Adam Smith, articulated how free-market capitalism operates through an invisible hand to lift all boats."
"You may not have heard of Smiths other major work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments."
"In it, the famed Scottish economist and philosopher articulated the necessary pre-condition of humane values essential to a properly functioning market."
"All over the world, we see examples of capitalism devoid of Smiths moral sentiments."
"In our American experience, we naturally accept that the private market system accelerates possibility and opportunity for human well-being and flourishing."
"We also recognize that the free market can be distorted, manipulated, stacked, unfair."
Herein lies the tension.
"As some economists have noted, in the long run, the market takes care of all problems."
"The famous economist John Maynard Keynes retorted: Yes, but, in the long run, we are all dead."
"Thus, a regulating moral force (properly informed government) is needed to ensure that the market operates fairly."
Healthy competition births innovation.
"To its credit, Google won the public's trust in the free marketplace of ideas, not through stifled competition."
"Like the robber barons of old, however, Google lost sight of the Smithian sentiment of sympathy, which keeps Smithian self-interest in check."
"In the robber baron era, children were exploited through factory sweatshops."
"While it is more subtle and sanitized, in todays big tech era, a new form of monopolistic exploitation of children has emerged: the tracking of their online behavior for profit."
"Sincerely, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry   P.S."

 News from Representative Courtney  Having trouble viewing this email?
"Dear Cormack,  Ive had a busy few weeks travelling across eastern Connecticut meeting with farmers, veterans, seniors, small business owners, and many other residents from just about every walk of life to discuss the issues that matter most to folks here in our region."
"Before Congress returns to Washington next week, I wanted to provide a quick overview of what Ive been up to this summer."
"Whether it was the communities in the Quiet Corner of Windham County, the greater Capitol region of Hartford and Tollandcounties or the southeastern and river valley regions along the shoreline, my travels over the last few weeks brought me to every corner of Connecticut's second Congressional District."
"Forums and Fairs in the Quiet Corner  The Quiet Corner has been buzzing with activity recently, and over the summer Ive met with folks and attended events all throughout Windham County."
"Ive had the chance to meet and speak with Quiet Cornerveterans, seniors, and community leaders about some their top priorities during visits to the Ashford Senior Center,the Windham Veterans Coffeehouse, and the Putnam Rotary Club."
"From the cost of health care and prescription medication to stoppingannoying robocalls, we covereda lot ofgroundduring these conversations."
"Top: Congressman Courtney at the Ashford Senior Center Bottom: Congressman Courtney at the Windham Veterans Coffeehouse    Itwasgreatto have a chanceto stop by Willimantic Waste earlier this summer for a tour of their brand new facility, and to receive an update onbusiness operations from the DeVivo family."
"Willi Waste has been operating since the 1940s, and theyre a local leader in providinggreenand sustainablerecyclingservices throughout thesecond district."
"Congressman Courtney at Willimantic Waste with co-ownerTom DeVivo    As eastern Connecticut residents know, with the close of summer comes the start of fair season."
"I had a great time at both the Brooklyn Fair and Woodstock Fair last month visitinglocal business stands and vendors, greetingsome of the impressiveshow cattle from farms across our state region, and seeing friendsfor great foodand music."
"I had the chance to help cut the ribbon toofficially open this years cornmaze atFortHill Farmin Thompson, and to stop by Fairholm Farm in Woodstock for a tour of thenearly century-old dairyfarm."
"Left: Congressman Courtney at Fort Hill Farm in Woodstock Right: Congressman Courtney at the Woodstock Fair     Farms, Tariffs and Foundations in the Greater Capitol region  Ive met with people all throughout the greater Capitol region of Hartford and TollandCountiesduring this August district work period."
One of the highlights from the past few weeks was joining the Vernon Police Departments Officer Cody Flanigan for a ride-along.
"Officer Flanigan is a total pro  he was named Vernon PDs Rookie of the Year last year, he takes his role as a Community Police Officer seriously, and folks in Vernon and in Rockville feel comfortable going to him for assistance."
"To everyone in eastern Connecticut who wears the badge, or who works in law enforcement, thank you for your service."
And big thanks to Officer Flanigan for a great ride-along.
"Congressman Courtney with Officer Cody Flanigan of the Vernon Police Department    At Vernon Manor Healthcare,I provided important updates on the issue of health care affordability, including my Medicare at 50 initiative."
"I also paid visits to Jarmoc Farms in Enfield, and to Hastings Farm in Suffield for updates on some new developments out at the farms."
"Jarmoc Farms is one of the first in our region to take advantage of the exciting new opportunity to grow and sell industrial hemp here in Connecticut, and Hastings Farm recently expanded their operations by opening a retail store that sells products straight from the farm."
Congressman Courtney at Hastings Farm in Suffield    In the past few weeks Ive visited several small businesses throughout our region.
My meeting with CNC Software in Tolland included a detailed discussion of the impact that President Trumps tariff war is having on their ability to move product and remain competitive  a consequence of this trade war thats being felt by many businesses in our region.
"I also had the opportunity to drop by American Woolen in Stafford Springs for a tour of the historic Warren Mill, and to receive a few updates on some of their exciting new developments from American Woolen Founder and CEO, Jacob Long."
"Jacob has completely turned things around from the time when folks thought that the Warren Mill might close for good its constantly humming with activity these days, and theyve become a real example of excellence in the American textile industry."
Congressman Courtney touring American Woolen with founder and CEO Jacob Long and Governor Ned Lamont    There have also been some important developments regarding crumbling concrete foundations in the past few weeks.
"After News 8 reported that Eversource was springing surprise bills on crumbling foundations victims before they could move back home following repairs, I was on the phone working to coordinate a solution between Eversource and the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA)."
"Not long after, PURA met with Eversource and secured an agreement to cease the practice."
"I also stopped by Trinity College in Hartford for an update on their work to help eastern Connecticut residents test their basement concrete for the presence of the mineral pyrrhotite, a known contributor to the crumbling foundations crisis, and met with the town CEOs of Coventry, Stafford, Vernon, and Ellington to provide an update on federal relief through the federal Community Development Block Grant Program."
"Congressman Courtney at Trinity College with Dr. Christoph Geiss and Dr. Jonathan Gourley     A busy summer across the southern shoreline region  Advocating on behalf of our regions seniors isone of my top priorities in Congress, and this district work period provided an important opportunity for meto hear directly from the sourceonpriorities for the retired communities in Southeastern Connecticut."
"I want to extend a thank you to the Estuary Council of Seniors in Old Saybrook, theSenior Resource Agency in Norwich, and the Colchester Senior Center for hosting me last month, and for engaging with me on topics like immigration, the cost of prescription drugs, and more."
Congressman Courtney at the Colchester Senior Center    The final weeks of summer were busy across Southeastern Connecticut.
"I had the chance to join the Audubon Connecticut for a bird walk in in East Haddam alongside State Senator Norm Needleman, and tostop by both Brush Hill Farm and Hillandale Farms in Bozrahfor an updates from the field."
"Congressman Courtney with members of Audubon Connecticut and State Senator Norm Needleman on a bird walk in East Haddam    From all corners of the district, my office hasheard from small businesses owners and workers about the negative impact the Presidents trade war is havingtheir businesses and their livelihoods."
"My visit to Research  Design Innovations, LLC, a small business owned by Madison resident Don Allen, only underscored this message."
"Congressman Courtney touring RDI, LLC with owner and Madison resident Don Allen    Finally, as Chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee overseeing  Navy shipbuilding, I hostedSecretary of Defense Mark Esper in Groton for his first visit to Electric Boat as Secretary."
The visit was a greatchance to demonstrate the incredible work underway at the shipyardto grow our undersea capabilities.
"Congressman Courtney joins Secretary of Defense Mark Esper for his first visit to Electric Boat in Groton     Its been a busyAugust district work period, and this is only a snapshot of all of the meetings and events I shared with many of you over these past few weeks."
"For instance,I also hosted a Telephone Town Hall discussion with over 5,000 eastern Connecticut residents, my office hosted a in-personCongressional Update meeting at Kelly Middle School in Norwichin which I took questions from constituents, and Ive been proud to announce a host of federal grant awards for projects in Essex, New London, Thompson, Putnam, Willimantic, and more."
"                                       News from Washington and Across West Texas Dear Friend,  Throughout the month of August, I had the opportunity to meet with many of you during my travels throughout West Texas, from our job creators, agriculture  energy producers, senior citizens, and many more."
"Now with school back in full swing and Congress coming back into session next week, I remain committed to advancing the policies and priorities that I heard about from the good people back home, which will ensure that our region stays strong and vibrant for decades to come."
"Celebrating the American Worker This Monday, we marked Labor Day, and thanks to the economic policies weve enacted under President Trumps leadership, there has never been a better time to celebrate the American worker."
"By lowering taxes on American families, rolling back red tape, repealing onerous, burdensome regulations, and providing incentives for companies to invest in our country, our employment picture looks the best it has been in decades."
"Unemployment is near the lowest rate in 50 years, with 17 straight months of unemployment below 4% and over seven million job openings, including one million more jobs open than there are workers to fill them."
"Not only are people looking for work and finding work, including our veterans who are seeing an 18-year low in unemployment, they are also seeing more take home pay as well."
"In fact, wages are rising for workers at the fastest pace in over a decade."
"Perhaps most importantly, wages are rising the fastest for workers on the lower end of the income ladder."
"The ingenuity, entrepreneurial spirit, and the indomitable work ethnic of the American people is why we are the most prosperous, generous nation on the face of the planet."
Thank you to every West Texas worker for all the good you do for America!
"Confronting China Theres no question that, going forward, our nations greatest existential threat is the Communist-controlled Peoples Republic of China."
"That is why I support our Negotiator-in-Chief, President Trump, holding firm in trade negotiations so we can secure a real and meaningful deal with China  not merely political window dressing."
"President Trump is right to take aim at Chinas long history of abuse and cheating on the United States and its unfair trading practices  from theft of our intellectual property to forced technology transfer, mass state subsidies of their industries, and dumping of cheap product on the global market."
"I applaud the administrations work to fight back against these economic abuses so we can ensure a more balanced, more reciprocal trade relationship in the years and decades ahead."
Click here to watch a conversation I had on Fox Business recently to talk trade and the latest on negotiations with China.
"Securing the Border and Stopping Illegal Immigration When it comes to welcoming immigrants, the United States is the most generous and compassionate nation in the world, but allowing for open borders and illegal immigration to persist is not compassionate for anyone, including those who are risking the safety of themselves and their families by making the dangerous trek to come to America."
"To help stem the tide of illegal immigration into our country, I recently introduced the Securing Comprehensive Review in Entry Enforcement Now (SCREEN) Act, which will ensure our already overwhelmed immigration system does not get further bogged down by those who abuse it."
"Not only will this legislation alleviate bureaucratic inefficiencies in the asylum process, it will also help reduce the troubling number of asylum seekers who have been released into the interior of our country, ensuring that migrants who do not have credible fear claims are not allowed in the United States in the first place."
"I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate, as well as the Trump Administration, to advance this legislative fix, which will fill a critical gap and close a loophole in our broken immigration process."
"Click here to learn more about my legislation, which advances my goal of securing our border and safeguarding our sovereignty as a nation."
Pro-American Energy Policies I was glad to be on hand in Lubbock last week to join EPA Region 6 Deputy Administrator David Gray for the announcement of a proposed rule on methane that will provide regulatory relief for our energy producers in West Texas and throughout the United States.
"Its no secret that the heart of Americas economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy."
The energy revolution and especially the innovations in technology we have seen from industry leaders here in West Texas in recent years have advanced our nations energy security while creating a significant reduction in carbon emissions.
"The EPAs new rule will reduce unnecessary and burdensome regulations, empowering our energy producers, especially our small and independent producers, to continue to lead the way in our nations energy dominance and environmental stewardship."
"I applaud President Trump and his administrations EPA for finding meaningful ways to balance the stewardship of our environment and economic growth, leaving our nation safer, stronger, and cleaner for our children and grandchildren."
Click here to watch media coverage of the announcement and here to read more about this new methane rule.
"The Hub City During my time in Lubbock last week, I also had the opportunity to meet with some of our local community leaders."
"Small businesses are the cornerstone of rural communities and the engine of the American economy, and I was pleased to speak with local business leaders at a Lubbock Chamber of Commerce roundtable."
"I also enjoyed getting to break bread and provide a legislative update to folks from the Texas Farm Bureau and the Plains Ginners Association, two groups that play a critical role in representing our regions agriculture interests and the needs of rural America so well."
Thanks for all you do for West Texas!
"The Red Raiders football team started the 2019 season off strong by storming past Montana State, 45-10, marking Matt Wells first win as Head Coach."
"This week, Tech will be back on the gridiron taking on University of Texas-El Paso for the annual Agriculture Game, which celebrates all things ag, from cotton to beef and other crops on the South Plains, as well as everything that makes Texas Tech a leader in the agriculture industry."
"Fall is a great time to enjoy football with family, friends, and good food, and I look forward to watching the Red Raiders successful campaign this season with my Guns Up!"
"Please know, it is an honor to be your Representative."
Feel free to reach out to my office and let me know how I can best serve you.

"@ISNA#ISNACON     Dear Friend,  Thank you for taking a moment to learn about what happened here inTexaslastweek."
"Leading the Fight Against Hate CrimesSadly, last year, hate crimes in Houston rose to a 10-year high."
"The Houston Police Department confirmed people were targeted for their race, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity."
That's one reason why I was proud to join my colleague Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) to introduce H.R.
"3545 - the National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act earlier this year."
"This important,bi-partisan bill strengthens existing federal hate crimes statutes by incentivizing better training, reporting, and prevention."
I was honored to receive strong community support from area civil rights and faith leaders at a recentpress conferencebacking this critical legislation.
"The event took place at St. John Baptist Church, a historically black church still recovering after a 2006 arson attack suspected as a hate crime."
Hate has no place in TX-22!

George    Congressional Update in Clear Lake It was an honor to join my Houston colleagues Randy Weber and Brian Babin at a recent Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce event.

The Clear Lake Chamber continues to do excellent work promoting business and entrepreneurship to keep our communities thriving and our economy booming!
Olson provides an update to Clear Lake Chamber members    Keeping TX-22 on the Cutting Edge of InnovationTechnology is the future of our economy.
"As a member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I'm committed to help our TX-22 businesses lead the way."
An important part of this effort is learning how the federal government helps or hinders this emerging industry.
My Emerging Technologies Advisory Council provides critical feedback on federal policies that I can bring to Washington.
"Last week, I hosted a working lunch to learn the latest developments at the intersection of the technology, science and labor sectors."
These entrepreneurs and tech-savvy business leaders know that innovation is at the core of job growth in TX-22 and vital to continuing our nation's booming economy.
Olson with members of his Emerging Technologies Advisory Council    I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

"Summer flew by and somehow, it is already September."
"Thanks to every Hoosier from the various counties, cities and towns across the Fifth District I was able to meet with throughout August."
Im energized and ready for what is going to be a busy fall.
Scroll through the remainder of this newsletter for a brief overview of Augusts work:  Vice President Pence hosted a roundtable discussion at the Indiana State Police Museum in Indianapolis last week.
"It was a privilege and an honor to join Vice President Pence, Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter, Debbie and Mike Laird, and other leaders of law enforcement to discuss how we can work together to reduce gun violence in our country."
"Red flag laws and bills, such as the bipartisan Jake Laird Act I re-introduced earlier this year, are a critically important part of the solution."
"Indiana is one of 17 states that currently have a red flag law, and four other states are considering similar legislation."
The Jake Laird Law allows law enforcement officials in Indiana to temporarily remove weapons from an individual who could be a danger to themselves or others.
You can learn more about the significance of red flag laws by watching these conversations with CBS4 and WISHTV.
"RELATED NEWS: Greentown officers used Jake Laird Law last month to confiscate 7 guns after shooting  Rep. Brooks hopeful states adopt red flag laws  Participated in the ribbon cutting of the Andersons Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge, visited Italpollinas new location and lab with the CEO Luca Bonini and wife, and met with Anderson Universitys president and faculty this month."
"Elected officials, community leaders and supporters gathered in Anderson for the dedication of the citys Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge, which links businesses, commuters, bicyclists and pedestrians to downtown Anderson."
This bridge is now dedicated to men and women of Madison County who bravely served our country in the armed forces.
"Also in Anderson, I appreciated the opportunity to visit Italpollinas North American headquarters and learn of their many successes since the company opened in Italy in 1973."
They are newly located in Anderson and operate in 70+ countries worldwide and offer a range of biotechnological and certification solutions for sustainable modern agriculture.
"Lastly, thank you to the President of Anderson University, John Pistole, and faculty members for inviting me to learn more about their new cybersecurity major, the National Security Studies Program as well as their new Tech Talent Incubator."
"Exciting, new things are happening at the university and I am pleased to hear of the new courses focused on securing and protecting our nation."
Joined the Indiana Soybean Alliance/Indiana Corn Marketing Council at a Greentown Shop Talk event at Kirkpatrick Farms.
Agriculture contributes an estimated $31.2 billion to Indianas economy!
"Our agricultural producers and growers are the reason we are able to put fresh produce on our kitchen tables and enjoy the seasonal goods we look forward to every year.Farmers from communities across the Fifth District joined me for an important discussion on tariffs, trade and extreme weather conditions that made this season especially difficult."
I will continue to work to ensureHoosierfarmers have the tools and resources needed as they work to feed families in Indiana and beyond.
"Pictured Bob Dubois, Noblesville Chamber President, Aaron Head, Economic Development Specialist of Noblesville, Mayor-Elect Chris Jensen, Deanna Leonard and Erin Goodman, the two owners of Caravan Classes, and Deputy Mayor Steve Cooke."
"The City of Noblesville is vibrant and continues to see economic growth and expansion, while keeping the small town feel alive in Hamilton County."
"I enjoyed a Noblesville Downtown Main Street Tour in order to visit with local business owners to discuss workforce development, expanding operations, the successes they have seen as well as the challenges they face in the community."
"I stopped in at Grindstone Public House, a restaurant right off the corner of main street Noblesville; Karisma, a fashion boutique whose owner hires high school students for their first working experience or summer job; and Caravan Classes, an art studio that allows space for creative minds and provides a mobile, pop up art studio for events and parties."
"Thank you to the many individuals and advocacy organizations, including advocates like AARP, who came to speak with me at my Connect with Your Congresswoman event at the Anderson Impact Center."
"For those of you who havent attended a Connect event, they are meetings for all who live in the Fifth District to attend where I can meet with constituents about matters that you care about most."
I am proud to represent such passionate and thoughtful residents of the Fifth District.
"If you didnt have a chance to meet with me in August, not to worry."
Ill be hosting another Connect event when I am home this fall.
The schedule of upcoming Connect events will be posted on my website as they are scheduled.
I look forward to meeting and speaking with more of you in the months to come.
Thank you to everyone who came to the event.
"As a proud member of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, I hosted a roundtable discussion in Carmel with Indiana advocacy organizations who regularly engage with government about how Congress can better interact with constituents and advocacy groups."
"Additionally, I also had the opportunity to:   speak at the Sertoma Club of Broad Ripple, the Bread for the World event in Noblesville, and the Indiana Cast Metal Association Member Dinner in Marion; meet with Fishers Chief of Police, Chief Ed Gebhart, who shared with me how Fishers Polices new Mental Health Task Force is working to better our community; and visit the new NeuroDiagnostics Institute and Advanced Treatment Center for mental health services, substance abuse treatment and recovery in Indianapolis."

"Sincerely,Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks  **BONUS VIDEO**    Click here for a quick view of this years Indiana State Fair."
"The Indiana State Fair has been bringingHoosiers together from around the state for more than 160 years, and is always a highlight of the year."
"I had a great visit with Fair Board President Todd Uhl, Executive Director Cynthia Hoye, Executive Assistant Lorene Graves, and members of the State Fair Board."
"This years theme, Heroes in the Heartland, celebrates the heroes who work to protect, educate and provide for our communities."
"Indiana farmers, first responders, educators, members of the military and more were honored throughout the event."
"Its pretty cool that over 850,000 Hoosiers attended this years fair."
"*Wicker Spearheads Ole Miss Tech Summit* *Leaders Gather in Oxford to Discuss Technology, Connectivity, and Innovation* The annual Ole Miss Technology Summit, which took place in Oxford at the end of August, brings together leaders to discuss how science, technology, and innovation are shaping our state and nation's future."
"I was a part of the inaugural event in 2016, and I have spoken at each successive meeting."
"The fourth summit was the largest and most impressive yet, and I was glad to join this time in my role as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee."
"This Tech Summit brought Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai, senior executives from companies like Comcast, NBC, DISH Network, and Google, and Ole Miss's top researchers into the same room so that we could understand the challenges and opportunities ahead."
"Mississippi has played an essential and historic role in technological progress, as I detailed in my remarks."
"The red glare of the Apollo 11 rocket engine that sent three men to the Moon in 1969 and transfixed hundreds of millions of people was first seen at Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, where the Saturn V was tested."
*Technology's Promise* Ensuring that the promises of technology and connectivity are available to every American is among my top priorities.
It starts with creating an economic environment where private companies work to close the digital divide between rural and urban areas.
"The day before the Tech Summit, Chairman Pai and I were in Fulton, Mississippi, to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for Fulton Telephone Company's ""Fiber to the Home Initiative."""
"We helped test this new, high-speed connection, and it was a pleasure to witness a small part of the divide close before our eyes."
Furthering this effort requires Congress to work with the FCC to understand where broadband is available and where it is not.
"The maps the agency had been planning to use for this were based on sometimes faulty data, which would have resulted in overbuilding in some areas and no connectivity at all in others."
"The Commerce Committee recently passed legislation I sponsored called the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act, which would require the FCC to improve its maps and provide the incentives to collect better data about broadband availability."
"The FCC understands this is a problem, and Chairman Pai is taking action through a new Digital Opportunity Data Collection program, which will incorporate feedback directly from the public."
"As Internet services reach more rural Americans, it is vital that this country remain on the cutting edge of new technologies."
That means winning the race to 5G - the next generation of broadband.
"This will open up new opportunities, create millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth, and allow for new uses of Internet services."
"For example, autonomous vehicles will soon move goods and people, saving time, money, and potentially thousands of lives as car crashes caused by human errors are taken out of the equation."
*The Next Moonshot* The Ole Miss Tech Summit was not only about the leaders on stage.
"It was also about the students who just started classes and the young people across our state who will benefit from, use, and create their own new technologies."
"Some of these students presented during the summit, and it was encouraging to hear their ideas and their optimism."
The Apollo Program inspired my generation to think big and to be limited only by the power of our imaginations.
"Future generations have the same pioneering spirit, and I am working in Congress to ensure that they have the tools needed to make their moonshots."

There are very few things that are as essential a part of government as ensuring communities have the ability to send and receive mail.
"This was a big win for North Canton which has gone far too long without its own post office, and I am honored that my office could help get this project across the finish line."
Keeping the Great Lakes strongThis week I also visited the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Districts Environmental and Maintenance Service Center to see the great work they are doing to help keep Lake Erie and our local waterways healthy and productive for generations to come.
"The Great Lakes are a critical part of Northeast Ohio, not just for recreational purposes, but also for our growing economy."
"Ive been working hard in Congress as a member of the Great Lakes Task Force to ensure the continued health of the Great Lakes, including supporting and cosponsoring legislation that promotes cutting edge research and ensures we have the knowledge and tools to keep our lakes and fisheries healthy and productive."
I look forward to continuing to work with the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District and other local organizations to ensure our waterways are supported now and into the future.
Innovative care for Northeast Ohio's kidsI paid a visit to Akron Childrens Hospital on Wednesday to talk about federal funding for childrens health initiatives and the importance of population health to lowering cost of care and ensuring healthier children in Northeast Ohio and beyond.
"Akron Childrens Hospital takes an integrated approach to care where pediatricians, mental health therapists and specialty doctors are all located in one facility in the community to help provide the best care possible for our children."
Innovation like this is key to ensuring healthcare for our kids is always moving forward.
I appreciated the opportunity to see the work Akron Childrens Hospital is doing for Northeast Ohio and am proud to welcome them to North Canton!
Bringing tech and innovation to the forefront in Northeast Ohio On Thursday I joined BioEnterprise Corporation for a roundtable to discuss the importance of helping bioscience and medical innovators grow their companies here in Northeast Ohio and make our community a destination for young families and innovators nationwide.
"My biggest goal in Congress is to help move our Northeast Ohio economy forward by making our region a destination for young families, entrepreneurs and innovators to lay down roots."
"We are ripe for new businesses and research and development in new and emerging technologies thanks to our talented workforce, and companies like BioEnterprise Corporation are key to promoting this type of investment in our community."
Our affordable housing market also makes us an attractive destination for young families looking for a place to call home.
There is no reason why Northeast Ohio should not be on the top of the list for any entrepreneur looking for cities to locate their operations.
"It is my hope that by working alongside companies like BioEnterprise who are helping bioscience and medical innovators grow their companies here in Cleveland, we will be able to develop a robust and diverse economy that will keep Northeast Ohio on the leading edge for generations to come."
"Dont miss my next Veterans Resource Tour event!My office is hosting another Veterans Resource Tour event on Wednesday, September 4 at the MAPS Air Museum in North Canton with a special forum on resources available specifically for veteran entrepreneurs."

 News from Representative Courtney  Having trouble viewing this email?
"Dear Cormack,  Following a busy week across the district, here with an update on a few important issues and priorities facing our region and state."
"Welcoming Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to Groton On Tuesday, I welcomed U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper to eastern Connecticut for a visit to General Dynamics Electric Boat (EB)."
"I joined Secretary Esper along with Governor Lamont, EB President Jeff Geiger,and other elected officials from Connecticut and Rhode Islandfor a tour of EB and some of the work underway at the yard."
We also discussed the strategic importance of submarine construction at EB and the crucial role they play in the readiness and expansion of our undersea fleet.
"From my ongoing effort to expand attack submarine construction beyond 2 Virginia-class submarines per year, to the decision to move additional maintenance work to the shipyard in Groton, theres been a lot of activity at EB this year, and its been great to see EB reporting on new employment statistics that show a major increase in the number of young people theyre hiring and attracting to eastern Connecticut."
"Thats all good news, because the workload doesnt appear to be slowing down:this year, in my first year as Chairman of the House Subcommittee onSeapowerand Projection Forces (which oversees much of the work being done at EB),the House authorized and appropriated funding for my effort to construct a 3rdVirginia-class submarine, and we have the first Columbia-class submarine on the horizon."
"EB is moving at a steady clip in terms workload and employment, and theyll continue to be a critical partner to our U.S. Navy as we work to modernize and expand our submarine fleet."
It was great to haveSecretary Esper join us in eastern Connecticut to see just how important our region and our manufacturers are to the U.S. Navy and to our national security.
Thanks toMr.Geigerand our hardworking shipbuilders atEB for the great tour.
"Rep. Courtney, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and others prepare for a tour of Electric Boat   An Update for Homeowners with Crumbling Foundations Addressing our regions crumbling foundations crisis is one of my top priorities in Congress."
"This week, Ive been working on the phone and on-site at Trinity College to help tackle some newly emerging issues, and to get an update on important research needed to betterunderstand and solve the problem."
"News 8s GeorgeCollireportedlastweek that eastern Connecticut homeowners who were moving back into their homes following crumbling concrete basement repairs were being charged with surprise bills from Eversource to reactivate their gas lines.For homeowners and families already operating on tighter budgets due to steep, unforeseen costs to repair crumbling foundations and basements,the costs from Eversource added insult to injury."
"Some families reported being charged as much as $1,600 by the utility before they could move back in."
"This was alarming news, and as soon we learned about the situation I was on the phone with JohnBetkoski, Vice Chairman of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), to find a way to work together with Eversource to get it fixed.Late last Fridaynight, we got the announcement we were looking for:Eversource issued a statement that they have re-evaluated their policy, and wont be charging these fees to homeowners impacted by crumbling concrete basements."
They also stated that they would reimburseimpactedratepayers who have already made payments.
"This is a huge relief for eastern Connecticut homeowners and families, and its the right thing to do."
Kudos to John Betkoski for helping to get the end result.
"To read more on Eversources decision to change their policy, click here."
"On Thursday of this week, I stopped by Trinity College in Hartford to tour the laboratories of their Environmental Science Program, where theyre currently assisting eastern Connecticut residents to test for the mineral pyrrhotite  a known contributor to the crumbling foundations crisis  in their basement concrete."
"I was joined by Tim Heim, the founder of the group Connecticut Coalition Against Crumbling Basements, and we were led on the tour by Trinity College researchers Dr. Christoph Geiss and Dr. Jonathan Gourley, who gave us an overview of some of their work."
"The Journal Inquirer's Eric Bedner covered my visit, and wrote a bit more about some of my other efforts to address the crumbling foundations crisis, including an amendment I recently passed in the House to provide $4 million for federal research into the effects of pyrrhotite on concrete aggregate."
Click here to read the full story.
"The research being done at Trinity Colleges labs is important  we need to be able to detect pyrrhotite in concrete in order to address it, and we have to keep gathering all of the information we can to understand the true effect of pyrrhotite on concrete."
"Ill keep pushing for a better understanding of this crisis, and towards more resources for homeowners impacted by it."
"Dr.Christoph Geiss and Dr. Jonathan Gourley share some details of their research with Rep. Courtney   Honoring the Crew of the USS Hartfordwiththe Yard Goats We had a great time on Thursday night celebrating the men and women of the USS Hartford, and its something weve been looking forward to for some time."
"Back in June, I was honored to be presented with a ball cap from the USS Hartford  a Los Angeles-class submarine stationed here in eastern Connecticut."
"I had the chance to return their kindness on Thursday, and to help recognizeour sailorswho really deserve it when we hosted the sailors of the USS Hartford at the final Hartford Yard Goats home game of the year."
Before the first pitch  thrown out by Chief Mike Covington-- the crew of the Hartford took to the field as thecrowd stood to honor them for their exemplary service.
"Just last year, the crew of the Hartford were named winners of the 2017 Battenberg Cup, beating nearly 100 other Naval vessels to be named the best all-around ship or submarine in the entire Atlantic fleetan award that dates all the way back to 1905."
The USS Hartford participated in the past two ICEX events  ice exercises that test sailors ability to complete challenging missions in the Arctic  and at the start of 2017 it received the Battle E Award as the best ship in its squadron.
"The sailors of the USS Hartford have accomplished a great deal, and I was glad to have the opportunity to help thank and honor them for their servicethis week."
Thank you to the Hartford Yard Goats for a great gamea 10-4 win!and for helping us to give the crew of the USS Hartford some special recognition.
"And a very big thank you to the men and women of the USS Hartford for joining us at the game  it was my pleasure to host them, and to join the crowd in thanking them for their service."
"Rep. Courtney hosts the crew of the USS Hartford at the final Hartford Yard Goats home game of the season    Protecting Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs Eastern Connecticut is home to some of the best manufacturers in the country, and folks who work in the industry know how just important our Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs) are to attracting, training, and preparing folks for their careers."
"On Thursday, I was joined by Congressman John Larson (CT-01), Joe Toner, President of the Greater Hartford-New Britain Building Trades Council, and Dave Hunt, President of Berlin Steel and of the Connecticut Ironworkers Employers Association, for a public discussion on a recently proposed rule by the Department of Labor (DOL) that would outsource the oversight of highly effective and widely supported IRAPs to private, non-union firms."
"The rule being proposed by the DOL is like a fox guarding the henhouse,according to one publication it would put less-than-reputable contractors in charge of crafting new, non-registered apprenticeship programs with little government oversight, creating duplicative, unnecessary, and lower-quality industry-recognized programs that wouldnt' provide the same benefits and protections to apprentices as do our long-established, registered apprenticeships."
"Whats perhaps most concerning is that workers and unions were left with little time to weigh in on the proposed rule change  the DOL worked to keep the public comment period for the rule as truncated as possible, leaving impacted industry representatives and unions with little voice in the matter."
"We got together on Thursday to call on the DOL to expand the public comment period to give people an actual chance to weigh in on the issue, and to call more attention to this proposed rule and the impact it could have on the well-being of apprentices and on the manufacturing industry at-large."
"Manufacturing plays a huge role in our states economy, and people who work in the industry deserve the same workplace protections and training expertise their predecessors have been able to access in years past."
"Rep. Courtney joins labor union members and leaders to highlight the importance of protecting apprenticeships    Trump Tariffs Continue to Impact Connecticut Businesses I was in Tolland on Thursday morning to meet with CNC Software and their CEO, Meghan West, who invited me to visit so that we could discuss the impact President Trumps ongoing tariff war is having on her business."
CNC Software an eastern Connecticut business that has been operating for over 35 years.
"They specialize in creating computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology, which is used all throughout the manufacturing industry  from designing and creation of prototypes and finishedproducts, to production runs, and more."
"CNC has provided CAD/CAM solutions to firms worldwide in the mold-making, automotive, aerospace, and consumer industries."
"Thousands of smallbusinesses across the country have suffered while this Administration has continued to increase economic tensions with China, including some of our own local businesses here in Connecticut."
"Meghan reports that in the fall of 2018, a 5% tariff was added to the sale of all of CNCs software in mainland China."
"Just last week I visited Research  Design Innovations (RDI) LLC, whose owner said that the increase of material costs due to the trade war are hurting his companys ability to do business."
"Earlier this year, Garbo Lobster was forced to shutter their doors permanently, and I helped its employees to secure Trade Adjustment Assistance through the Department of Labor (DOL)  an acknowledgement by DOL that the closure of Garbo was brought about by changes in trade policy."
"The question here is not the diagnosis: China is a bad actor on the international economic stage, there is bipartisan agreement on that."
The question is whether this Administration has provided the right prescription to solve the problem by going-it-alone in a tariff war thats already harming our small businesses here at home.
"I am committed to working alongside my colleagues in Congress to ensure that protections are in place for the thousands of businesses that have been impacted by the Chinese tariffs, and to fighting for a better way to address Chinasbehavior on the global stage by working with our allies around the world."
"Congressman Courtney meets with CNC Software CEO Meghan West  her team at their office in Tolland    Thank You for Participating in my Congressional Update We had some productive conversations at my Congressional Update at Kelly Middle school in Norwich on Monday night, and I want to sincerely thank all of you who were able to join us."
"It was great to see everyone, and to have a chance to hear from our community on a wide array of issues."
"From the cost of health care and prescription medication, to improving social security, gun laws and more, we covered a lot of ground throughout our conversations on Monday."
We also spent some time covering some of the bills the House of Representatives have gotten to work on and passed during our first 200 days of this Congress.
"To see a list of some of this work, click here to check out my 2019 Mid-Session Update on my website."
"Thanks again to everyone who was able to join us, and be sure to look out for similar events in the near future."
"      News from Representative Steve Womack                                   3RD DISTRICT                                 August 30, 2019    WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this weeks From the Front, I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nations capital, including Michael and Kelley Weir of Springdale and Anthony and Rhonda Doss of Springdale."
Safe travels back to the Natural State!
August is one of my favorite times of the year because it allows for several weeks of in-district work.
"I have used the month to make stops throughout the Third District and meet with constituents, families, businesses, students, and friends."
"From Russellville and Fort Smith to Rogers and Springdale, it was another busy week around AR-3."
"As your representative in Congress, one of my priorities is to do everything possible to build stronger communities and greater opportunity in our district."
Getting guidance and insight from local officials is critical to that process.
"I enjoyed meeting with Russellville Mayor Richard Harris, Atkins Mayor Rowdy Sweet, Pottsville Mayor Randy Tankersley, Hector Mayor Carey McGee, and County Judge Ben Cross to talk about the development and growth happening in the River Valley."
"We discussed upcoming project developments, business expansions, infrastructure, and bike trail projects."
I appreciated their time and all the work they do for Arkansans.
I then headed to Pottsville High School to talk with the senior class about their goals and the importance of being leaders.
"These young adults are at a pivotal moment in their lives, where their decisions, both good and bad, will have a lasting impact on the trajectory of their futures."
"We discussed the importance of education, good behavior, health, and service to others."
"As I told them, they are all the next generation of leaders."
"If they maximize and leverage their skills, not only will they find success - but America will also be stronger."
Mediocrity is not an option for these students - I want them to challenge themselves and push each other to be the best they can be.
"They asked great questions, and we even made sure to do a Go Apaches!"
call at the end of the assembly!
"A big thank you to the students, school leadership, teachers, School Superintendent Larry Dugger, and Jonathan Bradley for their time!"
Our community is home to extraordinary people and organizations.
"I had the opportunity to visit Russ Buss, a faith-based non-profit that provides resources and help to those in need."
"The organization, which is run by Fred Teague and supported by volunteers and donors, has a mission of providing homeless residents and others who have fallen on hard times with housing and assistance."
"Russ Buss also provides life-skills classes, including learning how to budget, develop savings, attain a job, write a resume, and develop workforce skills."
"Its about providing people with a hand up, not a handout."
Incredible stories of those overcoming addiction and the longstanding change that Russ Buss has helped people achieve!
Arming those facing hardship with the resources needed to succeed will allow them to improve their lives and reach their full potential.
"I also made a visit to my alma mater,Arkansas Tech University, to check out the recently opened lounge area for student veterans."
Freedom is a gift from our service members and veterans.
"We must support our troops when they come home, and facilities like Arkansas Tech Universitys Student Veterans Lounge help students as they transition back into civilian life and work toward their college degree."
"After my tour, I headed to Witherspoon Auditorium to kick off my second town hall event."
I thank all of the Russellville residents who took time out of their schedules to attend.
It was great to see so many constituents take part in civic engagement and discuss their priority issues.
"We covered a range of questions and topics, including social security, immigration, college affordability, and deficits and debts."
Transportation is a vital part of our region.
"Smart investments that modernize critical infrastructure are vital to the future growth and economic success of Arkansas, and I appreciated meeting with Arkansas Highway Commissioner Keith Gibson to discuss transportation, road, and economic development planning."
I then headed down the road to speak at the Arkansas Economic Developers and Chamber Executives Annual Conference.
Im proud to say that Arkansas is open for business.
"With low unemployment, job and wage growth, and investments in workforce training, our state is economically strong."
"While there is lots of development and opportunity in our region, we still have challenges."
"Building our pipeline of skilled labor, workforce training programs, and recruitment are all things we need to concentrate on to keep our competitive advantage."
"With states across the nation working to draw companies to their neighborhoods, its vital that we are making investments that will attract residents, job creators, entrepreneurs, and workers."
"The adage retail follows rooftops reminds us that we all have a stake in building dynamic communities that boast strong schools, public safety, hospitals, and infrastructure."
My next stop was to the Arkansas College of Health Education in Fort Smith to speak at the Healthcare Executive Summit.
"We have healthcare challenges: access and affordability, prescription drug prices, quality of care, the structure of our medical system, and much more."
"There is an intense national debate over the future of some of these problems, and an open dialogue is necessary to finding real solutions."
"So that means we need to concentrate more on effective reforms, not unrealistic proposals like Medicare-for-All, which would eliminate private insurance."
Its time to bring conversations back to reality.
"We need to focus on forward-looking and even-handed policies that increase transparency, move research forward, prioritize the patient-doctor relationship, and incentivize an innovative medical environment."
We all forget things from time to time.
"But for some, its not just a quick slip of the mind; its the initial symptom to a life-changing diagnosis of Alzheimers and a new and uncertain reality."
"We must care for those suffering from this disease, as well as our senior citizens who might need a little more help from day to day."
Thats why facilities like the Methodist Village Memory Care and Assisted Living center are so important.
I toured this facility and was amazed to see the dedication to long-term and quality care firsthand.
"I appreciated the great conversation with staff, nurses, doctors, and residents."
"One of the highlights of my visit was meeting Harold Mainer, a WWII veteran who survived the attack on Pearl Harbor."
The heroic acts of our Greatest Generation must always be remembered.
We owe them the freedom we enjoy today.
God bless Mr. Mainer and all those who have served.
"The following day, I joined the Bentonville Noon Rotary Club."
I got to pick out the opening song.
Youre a Grand Old Flag!
"I then gave a Washington update and discussed the Rotary ""4-Way Test,"" and how I think about it when analyzing policy proposals."
Is it fair to all concerned?
Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
Will it be beneficial to all concerned?
"Next on the agenda was a tour of Mundo-Tech, an important manufacturing facility that is based in Rogers."
"Mundo-Tech produces specialty tubing and pipes for the aerospace, defense, and commercial airline industries."
"Whether you are in the military or a resident traveling to your next vacation or business destination, it is likely that the aircraft you are flying in includes products from the Third District."
Mundo-Tech recently made a major investment and is in the process of expanding its facility.
The increased capacity will allow them to grow their supply production and workforce.
They are a great example of a family-owned Arkansas business that is helping move and protect Americans each day.
Their mission statement is Flight or Fight - We Deliver!
"I then headed back to my Rogers District Office to meet with Ralph Bishop about the opioid crisis, Kat Lynch to discuss the challenges of adolescent Type 1 Diabetes and research, and Randy Massanelli to talk about program development at the University of Arkansas."
I ended the day with hosting my Northwest Arkansas Town Hall in Rogers.
"These events allow me to hear directly from the people of Arkansass Third District about issues impacting individuals, families, and businesses in our community."
"During the hour-long town hall, I answered questions, listened to ideas, and discussed various subjects with residents."
"Whether we agree or disagree on certain topics, I appreciated having an open and engaging dialogue."
"The next morning, I drove to Springdale to take part in the Springdale Chamber of Commerces weekly meeting."
Weve seen a lot of downtown revitalization and growth  and gatherings like this support those efforts.
I wrapped up the week by visiting with Ozark Regional Transit.
Investments into transportation infrastructure support #AR3 and its continued growth.
ORT recently received two U.S. Department of Transportation grants to purchase new buses and build a modern facility.
I was grateful to see our joint advocacy in Congress turn into increased resources for local transit services!

Vice President Mike Pence in SC03   It was great to welcome Vice President Mike Pence to the Upstate to talk about the USMCA at Sargent Metal Fabricators in Anderson!
"We need America first trade deals, and it is refreshing to have an Administration that is constantly fighting for them."
"The Vice President delivered an amazing speech:  ""As I leave today, I leave with renewed confidence  confidence in this President, in his relentless determination to make this country safe and prosperous again."
"Confidence in each and every one of you in the great state of South Carolina, the state that is synonymous with all thats best about America: faith, and family, and freedom."

"For more information, please read my press release on the issue HERE."
Ill be sure to keep you updated.
F-16 Block 70 Update This month I joined the South Carolina Congressional Delegation in signing a letter to President Trump in support of Taiwans interest in purchasing the South Carolina manufactured F-16 Block 70 fighter aircrafts.

"Reflecting on the Congressional Delegation to Israel    A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit Israel with the largest ever bipartisan Congressional Delegation to the country, traveling with over 40 Democrats and 30 Republicans."
"I spoke with the Adirondack Daily Enterprise about my trip, which was on their front page earlier this week."
"From the Enterprise:  She had a schedule packed with back-to-back meetings and briefings, including conversations with Israeli military leaders and a discussion with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."
"She also visited regions close to the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian territory mostly surrounded by Israel, and the Golan Heights, an Israeli-occupied region captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War."
"In March, U.S. President Donald Trump broke with global convention and declared that the U.S. recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights."
Israel and the U.S. have a special relationship.
"They are one of our most important allies around the world,Stefanik said.We have shared values when it comes to democratic values, when it comes to freedom of different faiths in their region."
The fact that they are this thriving democracy is an anomaly in the Middle East today.
"Stefanik said Israel faces border threats from Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip."
"Its pretty clear, when youre in Israel, they are in a very tough neighborhood,Stefanik said.To see how small, geographically, the country is, and how really almost every border, except maybe the Jordanian border, they are under severe security challenges."
She said she visited anIron Domemissile defense system the U.S. worked to develop with Israel.
One of these defense systems is estimated to have a 90% success rate in intercepting inbound rockets.
"We were able to hear from some of the individuals and families that live on the kibbutz that face these sirens from rockets that go off on a weekly basis,Stefanik said.To hear their personal stories was pretty powerful."

"The ""Moving Wall"" in Sackets Harbor      Our Wounded Warrior Program Fellow in my Watertown District Office had the opportunity to attend the Moving Wall event in Sackets Harbor over the weekend."
"The Moving Wall is a replica of the original Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C.Members of the Association of the U.S. Army and Fort Drums 41st Engineer Battalion 2nd Brigade Combat Team assembled the Wall."
"I am so grateful to all of our North Country Vietnam Veterans for their bravery and service to our country, and am glad a veteran on my staff was able to attend the event."
"To read more about the Moving Wall, click here."
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates, and have a safe and enjoyable Labor Day!"

"""Infrastructure dollars is key."
"That's a theme that I hear all across the district."""
"At several points throughout the roundtable, Stefanik offered to work with attendees to apply for federal grants supporting local economic endeavors, including projects supporting new infrastructure or tourist sites."
"She called the funds an ""opportunity and a takeaway"" from the event."
"Attendees included representatives from the Center for Economic Growth, the Hudson River Community Credit Union, the Saratoga Chamber of Commerce and GlobalFoundries, a Malta-based semiconductor factory that employs around 3,000 in the Capital Region."
"Though community members highlighted strong economic performance in the Capital Region, they also pointed to a lack of public transportation and poor cellular service as obstacles both potential employers and jobseekers face when heading north."

"                                                   On Taxpayers Dime, Pentagon Buys Chinese Computers Vulnerable to Hacking  Last year, the Department of Defense (DoD) bought thousands of computer products and other electronics with KNOWN cybersecurity risks, including equipment from a company with connections tothe Chinese government."
"For more than a decade, government agenciesincluding DoDs own Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directoratehave repeatedly issued warnings about the dangers of using technology from the largest computer company in China."
"And if these repeated warnings werent enough, the Pentagons own Inspector General (OIG) said this compromises critical national security missions."
The risky equipment isnt cheap.
"DoD spent more than $30 million purchasing thousands of electronic products vulnerable to cyberattacks that are manufactured by Chinese companies, including one with connections to the communist regimes military and cyberespionage programs."
So lets recap: were spending tens of millions of YOUR tax dollars on high tech equipment with known cybersecurity risks.
The Pentagon needs to pull the plug on these products.
Using compromised equipment that is vulnerable to cyberattacks just does not compute.
"August Squeal Award: the Pentagon For these reasons, I am awarding my August Squeal Award to the Pentagon for wasting millions of dollars of taxpayer money on computers and other equipment that can be exploited by our adversaries."
And Im also calling on DoD to assess and mitigate the risk of any such high-risk equipment currently in use and prohibit the purchase of any additional technology with cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
"With the new and evolving threats we face today, we need to stay ahead of the curve with our technology and cyber."
"As the chairman the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, this is an issue Im especially concerned about."
"When it comes to our nations defense and security, lets make sure our tax dollars are being used in the most productive way possible."
We cant afford even a dime to go to waste.
Do you have an example of government waste or inefficiencies that I should take a look at?

 News from Representative Bradley Byrne                                ABOUT BRADLEY HOW CAN I HELP CONTACT BRADLEY WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?
"Dear Friend,  Its good to be back in Alabama after a wonderful visit to Israel!"
"With continued attacks on Israel from members of Congress and even members of the mainstream mediabeing exposed for anti-Semitic comments, therecould hardly have been a better time to personally reinforce our important alliance."
We Must Stand With Israel  Israel means so much to our nation.
The American people have no better friend.
"As the only democracy in the volatile Middle East, Israel is one of our greatest partners on the global stage."
"And Israel, particularly Jerusalem, holds a close personal significance to many Americans of different faiths."
Israel is a very special place to my wife and me.
"Four years ago, Rebecca and I traveled together to the Holy Land in a visit that affected us deeply."
"On this transformational trip, we renewed our baptismal covenant in the River Jordan."
"From the Golan Heights to the site of Solomons temple, our travels reinforced our Christian faith."
"Last week, I once again visited Israel."
"My visit coincided with a diplomatic dustup between Israel and two members of the Squad, Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar."
"The Squads hatred of Israel, support of the BDS movement, and denial of Israels right to exist weighed heavily on the minds of many Israelis who already live in danger."
"With all Israel faces, I respect Israels decision to block Tlaib, Omar, and their anti-Israel activism out of the country."
The week brought many moments of poignancy that provided important perspective.
"As part of our tour of the Old City of Jerusalem, we visited the Western Wall, which offered a meaningful opportunity for me to pray for our nation and state."
This was a very special moment for me.
"Looking down upon the City of David from the Temple Mount, one of the holiest spots in the world, it is difficult not to be overwhelmed."
"Being near the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac and walking the Southern Steps, where so many biblical figures traveled, was equally moving."
And it was thrilling to see the Bethesda pool from the fifth chapter of the Gospel of John.
Perhaps the highlight of the week occurred at the Mount of Olives and Gethsemane.
Praying at the site where Jesus prayed to his father before being crucified was a truly amazing experience.
"We met with several American and Israeli officials, including the U.S."
"Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who provided unique insights on Israels challenges."
Ambassador Friedman is a true champion of the U.S.-Israeli relationship A highlight of the week was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The opportunity to reinforce in person our two nations commitment to one another was of critical importance.
He is a great friend of the United States.
"Speaking with Israeli military officials about Israels missile defense programs like Iron Dome, Arrow and Davids Sling made it clear that Israel is in a tough neighborhood."
Adversaries like Iran would wipe them out if the chance arose.
"Israels high-tech defense programs are impressive, and Im proud of U.S. support for these programs."
"Without question, President Trumps steps to strengthen our alliance with Israel, including the bipartisan action of relocating the American embassy to its rightful location in Jerusalem, are beneficial and long overdue."
Both parties should support actions to strengthen this alliance.
I wish all my colleagues would visit Israel and talk directly with Israelis about the challenges they face.
"Israel is special place, and we must stand firm in our alliance with its people."
Israel remains a crucial American ally in a dangerous world.
"Though anti-Israel sentiments are only held by a minority of Americans, I am increasingly concerned they seem to be finding a sympathetic mouthpiece from the mainstream media."
Anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel cannot be tolerated or go unchallenged.
I promise to continue proudly standing with Israel.
Trump Administration Closes ImmigrationLoophole   The Trump Administration has moved to get rid of a loophole in immigration law that has allowed illegal immigrants to flood into our country.This was the right and humanitarian thing to do.
"There is much more to be done, but we cannot continue to condone and encourage illegality at our Southern border that fuels the ongoing crisis."

"Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney Dear Lindsey, From tackling local issues to fighting for all Americans at the federal level, I am committed to working #ForThePeople and this week I had the opportunity to meet and work with many of you in our fight to make our city and our country safer, cleaner, and more equitable for all."
"*Advocating to #EndGunViolence* [image = I hope you will join me this Sunday, August 25th at the Cafe at Cornell Tech for a coffee meeting with Moms Demand Action to learn more about how we can fight together to end gun violence."
"This conversation is a continuation of the #RecessRally we had last Sunday where activists, community leaders, and gun violence prevention organizations across the country demonstrated to demand action on gun safety."
I was proud to join many of you in Foley Square to demand that the Senate finally pass H.R.
8 to establish universal background checks for all gun purchases.
Gun violence is a uniquely American problem.
Our citizens are more likely to be killed with a firearm compared to those from any other industrialized nation.
"During this Congress alone, I've introduced five gun safety bills to combat this epidemic and save lives."
I won't ever stop fighting.
"Standing Up for the East 10th Street Community* [image = Also on Sunday, I joined with elected officials, business owners, and residents of the East 10th Street Community to demand that the Department of Sanitation finally remove the trucks that have blocked half of the parking on East 10th Street for over a year."
"These trucks not only emit a foul smell, but they also attract rodents and pose serious safety concerns."
I've written a letter to the NYC Department of Sanitation calling for an immediate solution to the gross problem and to finally give the community their street back.
"*Fighting for Public Benefits * [image = From proposals to cut SNAP, Medicaid, and affordable housing to the recent public charge rule, the Trump Administration has launched unprecedented attacks on our nation's most vulnerable communities and has threatened to take away food assistance from 3.1 million Americans who are struggling to put food on the table."
"We must protect the health and welfare of low-income seniors, immigrants, communities of color and other marginalized populations."
"This is why, on Wednesday, I joined with non-profit leaders at the Jacob Riis Settlement in Queens to urge Congress to pass the Working Families Tax Relief Act and the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act."
It is also why I introduced H.R.
"3323, the Nonprofit Relief Act of 2019 to reverse the burdens that the Republican Tax Scam has caused for non-profits so they can carry out their important missions without being penalized by unfair tax gimmicks."
*Snapshots from NY-12* [image = *On Monday I joined elected officials and community leaders from the Upper East Side to cut the ribbon on a new supportive housing unit for women and children.
"I'm so proud that our Upper East Side community has welcomed our new neighbors with open arms, and I hope that we are able to open even more housing units to help the nearly 40,000 NYC families experiencing homelessness."
* [image = *It was so great to join Council Member Ben Kallos and the East Side community late Monday night for the 79th Street power washing!
"From morning until midnight, I remain committed to making my community better and solving problems both big and small."
"* [image = *On Wednesday, I had the unique opportunity to stop by Local Union #3 and tour the Electrical Industry Training Center!"
"Unions are the backbone of our nation, and I loved learning about the important work the dedicated members of the Association of Electrical Contractors do."
"* As always, your concerns still and always will remain my top priority."
Please do not hesitate to email me through my website.
"            August 23, 2019               Home About Me Contact Media Center Services                   Celebrating my 1,000th Constituent District Event      I was thrilled to participate in and speak at my 1,000th Constituent District Event since taking office over the weekend!"
"This tally does not include my thousands of meetings with constituents in Washington, D.C."
"I spoke at the Bassmaster Elite Series Tournament in Waddington on the St. Lawrence River.The 5th annual Bassmaster Elite Series was a weekend long event, and I was honored to be there on Military and First Responder Appreciation Day."
I spoke about the importance of the St. Lawrence River to the North Country economy and recognized St. Lawrence as the number one bass fishing location in the world.
"is the worldwide authority on bass fishing and keeper of the culture of the sport, providing cutting edge content on bass fishing."
"has been dedicated to enhancing the sport of bass fishing by advocating for access, conservation and youth fishing."
Many of their original goals were directed toward protection of our natural resources.
"The mission of this organization was established prior to the time the Clean Water, Clean Air and Endangered Species acts were passed by Congress and before most of America's fisheries management scientists had even acknowledged that black bass could be overharvested or stockpiled."
"Hosting an Economic Development Roundtable in Corinth      I held an Economic Development Roundtable in Corinth this week with community business leaders and local elected officials, including State Senator Daphne Jordan and Assemblyman Dan Stec."
"We discussed infrastructure, federal grants, rural broadband access, and workforce development."
"With our friendly people, thriving tourism, and one of the lowest county tax rates in the state, Saratoga County is an excellent place to live, work, and visit."
"I am proud of our strong commercial growth and a diverse local economy that ranges from Global Foundries, the largest high-tech economic development project in the country, to thriving family farms that are some of the best in Upstate New York."
Saratoga County is one of the fastest growing counties in our region.
It sets the bar for how business and government work together to better the lives of the community.
"Advocating for Health Care Access for all of the North Country  This week, I penned an op-ed for Sun Community News on the importance of access to quality health care in rural areas like the North Country.I have been fortunate to visit with many of the people who work at health centers in my district  Hudson Headwaters, North Country Family Health, and the Community Health Center of North Country  which collectively provide more than 95,000 people in North Country with critical health services."
"Their work as problem-solvers in public health  whether it is bringing needed dental services to children in schools or addressing the opioid epidemic with innovative treatments to break the cycle of addiction  has made a local, life-saving impact."
Im proud to work across the aisle with my colleagues in Congress to extend critical funding for health centers before it expires on Sept. 30.
"Legislation I introduced, The Community Health Investment, Modernization and Excellence (CHIME) Act, has laid the groundwork to stabilize funding for health centers so they can continue to build the workforce, facilities and services to reach more people."
There is bipartisan agreement that a long-term funding extension will not only improve health care for families but also deliver health-care cost savings to American taxpayers.
I was honored to be awarded a 2019 Distinguished Community Health Champion Award from the National Association of Community Health Centers in March of this year for my advocacy of quality and affordable health care access in rural communities.
Read my full op-ed here.
"As always, thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates!"
"Sincerely,    Elise StefanikMember of Congress           Social Media Corner:     ___________________  Featured Read:  Press Republican:Stefanik sponsors energy legislation  North Country Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is introducing legislation aimed at addressing incentives for renewable energy."
"The Renewable Electricity Tax Credit Equalization Act is legislation to extend tax credits for investments in qualified renewable energy production, including closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower, and marine and hydrokinetic, according to a news release from Stefanik (R-Schuylerville)."
The bill also equalizes the treatment of renewable technologies by eliminating the arbitrary 50 percent reduction of the production credit for these baseload technologies.
Stefanik is introducing the legislation along with Congressman Scott Peters (D-CA).
"Im proud to introduce this legislation to stop the federal government from picking winners and losers among renewable energy production and to incentivize the utilization of clean renewable energy to bolster both our economy and environment, Stefanik said."

"Then, I hosted a roundtable discussion at Hydraflow, which included other local aerospace manufacturers and supplier companies such as Pacmin, Ejays Machine, Aero Pacific, Aerofab Corporation, APV Manufacturing, Coast Aerospace, and AiReps."
"All these companies are promoting numerous technological innovations, from building cybersecurity software solutions to developing and manufacturing products for aerospace clients."
Each of our roundtable participants has a unique role in contributing to the economic health of our district.
We must continue to maintain a business and community environment that supports and attracts companies as well as creates more jobs for our constituents.
