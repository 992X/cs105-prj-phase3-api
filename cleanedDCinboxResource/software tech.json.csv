"Legislative Update        On January 30, 2020, Congressman G. K. Butterfield (NC-01) and Congressman Billy Long (MO-07) introduced the Protecting Natural Gas Consumers from Overcharges Act of 2020."
"The bipartisan bill aims to protect natural gas consumers, residential and industrial, from overpaying for their use of natural gas."
The bill amends the National Gas Act to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to set a refund effective date and order a refund when an interstate pipeline is found to be overcharging for its services.
FERC currently has these authorities under the Federal Power Act to order refunds from interstate electric utilities when they determine overcharges have been made.

Safe travels back to the Natural State!

"It was a hectic time in Washington with my tributes to two Arkansas business legends on the House floor, the historic United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) being signed into law, President Trump unveiling his Middle East peace plan, and another House Budget Committee hearing!"
"This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor the lives and legacies of David Glass, former Walmart Chief Executive Officer and owner of the Kansas City Royals, and Forrest Wood, the founder of Ranger Boats, who both passed away this month."
David and Forrest exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of the Natural State and transformed the business and fishing industries that they helped lead.
"They will be greatly missed, and it was my privilege to share some of their accomplishments and contributions with Arkansans and the nation."
Watch the speeches by clicking the below videos or read my remarks .
Rep. Womack honors David Glass (above) and Forrest Wood (below) on the House floor            The USMCA is a critical trade deal that modernizes U.S. trade policies with Canada and Mexico – two of Arkansas’s top trading partners.
"The legislation provides a strong framework that will support economic growth, enhance market access, create jobs, and unleash new sources of opportunity."
"For those of you who might be unfamiliar with the agreement, here are some of its key provisions:    Increases market access for Arkansas products in Mexico and Canada Gives Arkansas poultry producers new export access to Canada for chicken and eggs Expands the ability of Arkansas producers to sell turkey abroad Supports more than 120,000 jobs in the Natural State Assists American innovators by creating a new chapter dedicated to digital trade Creates hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide Bolsters American auto production and automotive jobs."
"The USMCA is a win for Arkansas and America, and this week’s signing delivers a 21st century trade framework."
"This landmark agreement expands market access for the Natural State’s world-class products, which will grow our economy and support Arkansas’s hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and families."
"Trade is vitally important to the Natural State, with Canada and Mexico accounting for one-third of Arkansas’s exports."
"A  from the World Trade Center Arkansas found that, in 2018, exports to Canada amounted to $1.2 billion, and exports to Mexico totaled $870 million."
"Besides the data that highlights the significance of our trade partnerships with these countries, I have also  of this agreement from Arkansas businesses, farmers, ranchers, and consumers firsthand."
It’s exactly why I continually advocated for the USMCA in Congress and voted to pass this vital legislation in December.
"By negotiating from strength – the Administration is delivering results, creating jobs, and building a foundation for an even stronger economy."
This landmark agreement puts America first!
I thank President Trump for his work and commitment to getting this deal across the finish line.
"Promises made, promises kept!"
The President also announced his .
"The strategy focuses on achieving peace, security, and opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian people."
"With the announcement of this strategy, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to securing peace in the Middle East."
No nation can create a safer and more prosperous global community alone – and it is time for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lay a new foundation.
"On behalf of the people, they have the opportunity to resume negotiations and take bold action for a brighter future."
Centuries of hostilities won’t be solved overnight – but comprehensive peace is within the grasp of those willing to forge a transformative path.
"I applaud the Administration for outlining a powerful vision and taking constructive steps to deliver harmony, stability, and security in the region."
It’s noteworthy that the advancement of these important priorities is a stark contrast to the Democrats' impeachment agenda.
"While they remain focused on removing a duly-elected President, Republicans continue to concentrate on issues that contribute to the strength of Arkansas and America."
"The results speak for themselves – thanks to GOP pro-growth policies, we are seeing economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment rate, sustained wage growth, and millions of new jobs created."
"In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and found that real GDP has grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate for the first three years of the Trump Administration, beating expectations."
"We should certainly celebrate this historic economic prosperity, but we cannot ignore the fact that we continue to face serious long-term fiscal challenges, particularly the ever-increasing federal debt."
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its annual baseline confirming what we already know: our country is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory.
"Specifically, in fiscal year 2020, CBO expects the deficit will be $1.015 trillion, an increase of $31 billion from last year."
"On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues on the House Budget Committee and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel for a hearing on this very topic."
It should be deeply unsettling to all of Congress that FY 2020 will be the first year since FY 2012 that the deficit will eclipse $1 trillion.
"Looking even further ahead, if we do not take action to get our fiscal house on a responsible path, the deficit will be $1 trillion by FY 2021, and then rise to $1.74 trillion by FY 2030."
Deficits will total $13.1 trillion over the budget window.
"Our country’s unsustainable deficits are driven by our out-of-control mandatory spending, which includes daunting interest payments on our debt."
"Mandatory spending currently accounts for 70 percent of the federal budget, and it is on track to reach an alarming 76 percent by FY 2030."
"To put this in perspective, in 1965, mandatory spending accounted for only 34 percent of the federal budget."
"We’ve heard about the reality of our fiscal trajectory time and time again, and yet it still seems as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not taking these warnings seriously."
"Policies promoted by Democrats would increase mandatory spending by tens of trillions of dollars, thus drastically adding to the national debt."
The most notable unrealistic policy proposals that come to mind include Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal.
"It is critical that Congress come together to address our daunting fiscal outlook, and yet, Democrats continue to promote outrageously expensive policies with no way to pay for them."
Our debts and deficits underscore the pressing importance of budget resolutions – which are supposed to come from this Committee as a long-term financial plan for the country.
"Under Democrat control, our Committee did not put forward a budget resolution last year, and it doesn’t appear that we’ll have one this year either."
"In every business, in every city, in every state, a budget is done every year."
"Yet, in the greatest country in the history of the world, we’re not doing a budget."
It is my hope that this hearing opened the eyes of some to the stark reality we face.
We simply must start making tough budgetary decisions in order to put our country on a responsible fiscal path and deliver on our duty to the American people.
"Read my full remarks   MEETINGS In between votes and legislative business, I also had the opportunity to meet with organizations from the Natural State!"
"I welcomed members of the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association from Russellville, Bentonville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, Fayetteville, and other parts of the state to discuss criminal justice issues and reform policies."
"I then met with David Smith, a Housing Assistance Coordinator in Fort Smith – who is also part of the Region VI National Community Development Association – to discuss the Community Development Block Grant program and other initiatives that support housing and community development."
The Third District is home to exceptional schools and educators.
"It was a pleasure to sit down with John Brown University President Chip Pollard to talk about higher education, student curriculum, and the University’s priorities."
I'm proud of the strength of our faith-based colleges and universities in Arkansas.
"I also met with members of the Head Start program, which focuses on improving the lives of children and families throughout Northwest Arkansas."
"They do important work in our community by creating learning environments that support children's growth in many areas such as language, literacy, and social and emotional development."
"I appreciated meeting with Head Start representatives from Rogers, Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, and Lowell – and thank them for their productive conversations and work on behalf of the Third District."
My next meeting was with Dr. Leonard Notto of Russellville and Dr. Rodney Williams of Little Rock.
"We talked about healthcare issues, chiropractic medicine, and Medicare."
I then sat down with Sebastian County Justice of the Peace Danny Aldridge to talk about how software designed at the 188th Air Guard unit in Fort Smith was used during the historic floods we saw last year.
The technology aided services to our citizens and helped save millions of dollars in disaster relief.
"While in Washington, Mr. Aldridge also attended the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Executive Forum at the White House."
"The event, which included representatives from government, military, and top businesses and universities, was focused on a joint project to make the government more efficient in responding to natural disasters through the use of artificial intelligence."
"Our community knows firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be, and we must ensure that our communities have the necessary tools to respond, rebuild, and become more resilient."
"Additionally, I am pleased to announce $420,000 in federal investment for the Economic Development Districts based in Harrison and Fort Smith."
The funding – awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA) – will support the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District (NWAEDD) and the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District (WAPDD).
These organizations focus on creating and implementing comprehensive economic development strategies for communities throughout the Third District.
Our regional Economic Development Districts play an integral part in spurring growth and creating a competitive advantage for the Third District.
"News from Congresswoman Eshoo      Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window   Click here to open a plain text version of this email                                   NEWSROOM  18TH DISTRICT                January 31, 2020              Weekly Report From Your Congresswoman    This week the Senate continued the impeachment trial of President Trump based on the two Articles of Impeachment the House passed last month."
"The trial began with three days of the House Impeachment Managers making their case for removal, followed by three days of the President’s attorneys defending him."
Senators then submitted written questions which the Chief Justice read aloud and the House Managers and the President’s attorneys responded to.
"On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives continued advancing its agenda for the people by introducing and passing bills, holding hearings, and oversight of the Executive Branch."
"As I write this to you, we await the decision of the full Senate as to whether witnesses and documents will be allowed in the trial."
"Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week   CDC Briefing on Coronavirus I met with Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Dr. Tony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response; and Rear Admiral Denise Hinton with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)."
"The coronavirus is a respiratory illness caused by a virus first identified in Wuhan, China."
"Most of the known cases and all deaths associated with the disease have been in China, with only seven confirmed cases in the U.S. to date."
"According to the CDC, the risk to the American public is low, unless someone has recently traveled to Wuhan and is experiencing respiratory symptoms."
"For the latest information about the coronavirus, visit the CDC’s website."
"To prevent transmission of diseases, two simple but powerful acts of prevention are recommended."
"Wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly, and cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, and everyone should get a flu shot."
"Questioned the CEO of PG&E at House Energy and Commerce Hearing on Wildfires  The two most destructive fires in Californian history, including the 2018 Camp Fire which killed 85 people and destroyed over 18,000 buildings, were linked to PG&E’s equipment."
"On January 29th I grilled the CEO of PG&E, Bill Johnson, about the utility’s widespread intentional blackouts at a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Subcommittee on Environment & Climate Change on the impact of wildfires on the power sector and the environment."
You can watch my questions from the hearing HERE.
Addressing the scourge of wildfires in California continues to be a top priority for me.
"Last October, I introduced the Smoke Planning and Research Act to provide federal funding to help communities research, develop, and implement plans to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke."
I’m also pushing hard to strengthen infrastructure to withstand wildfires.
"In July, 2019, I introduced the WIRED Act to allow states to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that will be resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters."
"Currently, states lack this authority and the consequences have been dire."
"Health Subcommittee Hearing on Food and Drug Safety  As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine ten mostly bipartisan bills to improve the safety and transparency in our food and drugs."
Twenty cents out of every dollar spent by American consumers goes toward food or medicine regulated by the FDA.
We examined the FDA’s immense mission with two panels of expert witnesses.
Our first panel considered four bills to grant the FDA new authorities to tackle challenges that threaten our drug supply.
"Taken together, these bills improve the drug supply chain from the very beginning to the very end so that patients have access to quality products that are genuine, affordable, and accurately labeled."
The second panel considered six bills that affect the FDA’s oversight of food products.
Many of these bills act on decisions that the FDA has long delayed.
"For example, we heard about one bill, the FASTER Act, which would require food manufacturers to list sesame as an allergen on their products."
It would also fund into federal studies to better understand the growing prevalence of food allergies in the United States.
"To watch my opening statement, click HERE."
"Voted YES on the No War Against Iran Act  President Trump’s assassination of General Soleimani has placed U.S. service members, diplomats, embassies, and allied interests around the world at high risk, and has brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war."
"To add insult to injury, the President failed to properly consult Congress or seek the legal authority to take military action against Iran."
"The Administration has also failed to fully explain what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the U.S. that required the strike."
"No Member of Congress carries a brief for General Soleimani or the Iranian government, but no President has the unilateral authority to take our nation to war without authorization from Congress."
The No War Against Iran Act underscores that Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Iran.
It also prohibits federal funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.
"I’ve long had concerns about the Trump Administration’s provocative behavior toward Iran, beginning with the President tearing up the Iran nuclear agreement, and it’s why I introduced the Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act last April."
My bill restricts this Administration and any future administrations from using any funds appropriated by Congress to take military action in and against Iran without authorization from Congress.
House Infrastructure Package  This week the Majority released our framework for a five-year $760 billion infrastructure bill.
"The framework addresses our nation’s crumbling infrastructure by investing in zero-emission vehicles, expands access to broadband, upgrades clean water infrastructure, and creates an estimated 10 million new jobs."
"The package also authorizes $12 billion to modernize our country’s 9-1-1 systems, based on my legislation the Next Generation 9-1-1 Act."
You can read more about the infrastructure plan HERE.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  The Workforce Mobility Act  I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will help workers by prohibiting the use of non-compete agreements."
This occurs when an employer restricts an employee’s future prospects through their employment contracts.
"While California has long prohibited non-competes, 40 percent of Americans have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point in their career."
"Reps. Scott Peters, Mike Gallagher, and I introduced the Workforce Mobility Act to ban non-compete agreements with a few narrow exceptions (such as the sale of a business)."
"Much of Silicon Valley was built by former employees of one tech company leaving to found another, all allowed because of California’s ban on non-compete agreements."
This ban continues to allow the Valley to prosper as an innovation powerhouse.
"I’m proud that my legislation will make this a nationwide policy, ensuring all Americans have the ability to innovate."
"The Protecting Community Television Act  Community television is a critical part of our society, giving a voice to nonprofits, artists, schools, local governments, and other community members who otherwise struggle to be heard."
I introduced legislation to ensure that community television operations continue to receive the resources they need to educate and inform viewers in the cities and towns where they operate.
"Today, local governments are permitted to require that cable companies meet community needs by providing in-kind contributions that benefit public, educational, and government (PEG) channels, also known as community television stations."
Unfortunately the FCC proposed regulatory changes that would effectively end the in-kind contributions that support PEG stations.
Senator Ed Markey and I introduced the Protecting Community Television Act to block the FCC’s proposal and bolster community TV.

"My work to fund the removal of unexploded ordinances, such as landmines in Laos from the Vietnam War era has received bipartisan support in Congress and will save the lives of so many who remain vulnerable to these landmines."

"Also this week, Foley & Lardner decided to drop the Maduro regime in Venezuela as a client and return the $12.5 million they received to represent the illegitimate regime after Senator Scott said he would no longer meet with anyone from that firm."
"Senator Scott will always stand with those fighting for freedom, and will never stay quiet if any business decides to support Maduro and his gang of thugs."

"Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m proud to join Senator Tim Scott and my colleagues to recognize National School Choice Week."
"Dear Lindsey,  Across the United States, 240,000 students have been deceived or defrauded by failed for-profit colleges and appealed to the federal government for debt relief."
"1,000 of these students are from Connecticut."
"In September 2019, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released a rule aimed at rolling back borrower defense protections, which allows students to receive loan forgiveness when they have been victims of predatory for-profit colleges, such as Corinthian or ITT Tech."
The rule creates a new three-year time limit for borrowers to submit loan forgiveness claims.
It also requires defrauded students to prove personal financial harm in order to access relief.
"In addition, the rule requires the Department of Education to review every case individually, even if the institution had already been proven to have engaged in misconduct."
I voted with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to overturn the Department of Education's rule and stand up for students defrauded by for-profit colleges throughout the United States.
"I fought for this resolution to protect students from institutions which award degrees that have no value, insurmountable debt, and no means of accessing justice."
"On December 12, 2019, the House Committee on Education and Labor held a hearing examining the Department of Education’s implementation of Borrower Defense."
"During this hearing, I pressed Secretary DeVos on her efforts to undermine this vital policy."
I will always advocate on behalf of our nation's hardworking students.
"Last year, I introduced legislation to make it easier for students defrauded by closed institutions to qualify for loan forgiveness."
"The Pell Grant Restoration Act would restore a student's Pell Grant eligibility to allow them the chance to get an education at a credible institution, which will provide them with the credentials necessary to succeed."
I will continue to champion student protections and ensure all people in the 5th District have access to a quality and affordable education.

Highlights of What I Did in Congress This Week  Voted YES on War Powers Resolution   The House voted to require President Trump to immediately terminate military operations against Iran.
The President has taken our nation to the brink of war without properly consulting Congress or seeking the legal authority to do so.
"Only Congress can authorize military action under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution."
"To add insult to injury, the Trump Administration has failed to fully explain to Congress and the American people what, exactly, the imminent threat was to the United States that required the strike to take out General Soleimani."
You can watch my remarks on the war powers resolution here.
"Attended Classified Briefing on Iran by Administration Officials  On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire briefed the full House of Representatives in a classified setting on Iran."
"Members asked tough questions, but the Administration failed to share any actionable intelligence that the attack was based on."
"Specifically, they could not answer what the ‘imminent threat’ was that compelled them to undertake the strike."
"Hearing on Improving Health Care Coverage and Outcomes    As Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee, I held a hearing this week to examine seven bills to improve health outcomes for kids and strengthen benefits and coverage for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries."
We examined:   Legislation to extend Medicare coverage of post-transplant drugs for kidney transplant recipients.
"Currently, Medicare only covers necessary drugs to prevent kidney failure for 36 months."
This legislation is projected to save 375 kidney transplants a year;   Legislation to provide funding to advance the study and prevention of Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood (SUDC).
"This is the death of a child over the age of 12 months that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation and autopsy;   Legislation to award grants to schools to encourage better allergy and asthma treatment;   Legislation to improve birth outcomes in high-risk communities through increased funding for mothers;   Legislation that requires health plans to cover medically-necessary treatments related to a patient’s birth defects, congenital disorders, or congenital malformations;   Legislation that updates the Part B enrollment process for the first time in 50 years, protecting Medicare beneficiaries from a lifetime of financial penalties because of a failure to enroll promptly in Part B;   Legislation that requires states to offer a non-emergency medical transportation benefit to Medicaid beneficiaries, ensuring 70 million low-income and disabled individuals have reliable transportation to access the care they need."
This would be a godsend to so many people in our country!
"To watch my opening statement, click here."
Voted YES on the PFAS Action Act of 2019  Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (referred to as PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals found in many commercial products.
"These chemicals have strong chemical bonds and do not break down easily in the environment, causing them to accumulate in humans and wildlife."
"PFAS have long been linked with adverse health effects including cancer, immune system effects, infertility, impaired child development, high cholesterol, and thyroid disease."
The House passed the PFAS Action Act which requires the cleanup of sites contaminated with PFAS; the monitoring for PFAS in drinking water; and the creation of new standards to limit further human and environmental exposure to PFAS.
"Voted YES on the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020  According to a 2018 North Atlantic Treaty Organization report, Huawei’s influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations."
"The House passed the Secure 5G and Beyond Act to require the Administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems."
This strategy must also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies without sacrificing reliable internet access.
"Legislation Anna Introduced and Cosponsored this Week  Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act  Aviation currently accounts for approximately three percent of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and the emission rates are expected to triple by 2050."
"The Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act bolsters NASA’s efforts to reduce emissions from aviation, while also reducing the impact of airplane noise."
"Specifically, this bill:   Establishes a goal of commercial airplanes emitting 50 percent less greenhouse gas and 50 percent less noise compared to 2019 levels by 2030 for regional planes and 2040 for larger, single-aisle planes;   Authorizes NASA to accelerate its work on electrified propulsion systems to achieve noise and emissions reductions;   Challenges NASA to work with industry partners to carry out flight tests by 2025 and to bring new airplanes into service between 2030 and 2040; and   Requires NASA to provide guidance on new technologies to help the FAA’s work to ensure the safe and effective deployment of these technologies."
Horse Transportation Safety Act  Transporting horses in double-deck trailers is often dangerous because they do not provide enough headroom for horses to stand upright.
The livestock often endure long journeys in cramped positions and sustain serious injuries as a result.
"To address this problem, the bipartisan Horse Transportation Safety Act prohibits the transportation of horses in interstate commerce in a motor vehicle containing two or more levels stacked on top of one another."
"Weekly Highlights  Congressional App Challenge Winner   It was a pleasure to visit Saratoga High School to announce the winner of the 2019 Congressional App Challenge for California’s 18th Congressional District, Sidney Hough."
"Sidney’s app, Uproot, prevents heavy crop losses by identifying invasive plants."
"Using machine learning and artificial intelligence, Uproot analyzes photos of plants in real-time to detect growth that is harmful to crops."
"Congratulations to Sidney, and bravo to the 16 Challenge participants for pursuing innovative technology to create meaningful change."
"I co-chair the Congressional Internet Caucus, which hosts the Congressional App Challenge."
"The Challenge is a bipartisan, nationwide competition and is comprised of high school students from all participating congressional districts that compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or “app,” for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice."
"The competition is designed to promote innovation and engagement in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education fields."

I’ve advocated for over a decade to protect the public from unwanted calls and I’m thrilled we passed this law to bring relief to the American people.

"News from Representative Steve Womack          HOME      ABOUT STEVE      SERVICES      3RD DISTRICT      ISSUES & LEGISLATION      NEWSROOM       January 3, 2020    WEEK IN REVIEW I hope you all had a Happy New Year!"
"To start off 2020, I had the opportunity to meet with some of the best and brightest students from Arkansas's Third District."
It was my privilege to honor the winners of the latest Congressional App Challenge!
"This annual and nationwide coding competition for middle school and high school students aims to encourage our nation’s youth to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education and computer science careers."
"We received many incredible and novel applications from amazing students across AR-3, and I am pleased to announce that the 2019 winners are: Julian Sanker, an 11th grader at Haas Hall Academy (Fayetteville), and Lucas Kellar, a 10th grader at the Don Tyson School of Innovation (Springdale)."
"Julian and Lucas’s winning app, Crime Map, uses publicly available crime and emergency data to populate an interactive and real-time map."
Residents can search the map to see 911 dispatches in the area and learn of emergency situations and danger in their community.
The application also features custom icons that illustrate the nature of the call and allows users to filter the data by different categories.
Crime Map will now be featured on a digital display in the U.S. Capitol and on the Congressional App Challenge website!
More information about the winning app can be found here.
"Today, I presented these students with certificates and medallions to recognize their work."
"A video that highlighted their app was played during the ceremony, and I was impressed by the application, its functionality, and the tech skills of these students."
"I was also pleased that local technology professionals from Startup Junkie, Dr. Martin Schoppmeyer (Haas Hall Academy Superintendent), Dr. Jim Rollins (Springdale Public School District Superintendent), and others from the community were able to attend."
"Our students are the next generation of innovators, and it’s great to see them leverage their skills both inside and outside the classroom."
"I congratulate Julian and Lucas on this impressive accomplishment, which characterizes the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit that has inspired Arkansans for generations."
"This competition continually showcases the brilliant young minds of the Third District, and I look forward to seeing where their coding capabilities lead them in the future."
"This is the fifth year that I have hosted the Congressional App Challenge in Arkansas’s Third Congressional District, and I look forward to hosting the competition again in 2020!"
"I'm proud of all of the participants, and I hope their work will inspire other gifted students in our district to pursue STEM education and computer science careers!"
The safety and security of America at home and abroad is a critical priority.
"As you might have seen on the news, Qassem Soleimani, a leader of Iran's Quds Force, terrorist, and enemy of peace is confirmed dead."
The President’s decisive action made it clear that the U.S. will not tolerate escalating threats and aggression.
Soleimani was a dangerous enemy whose goal was evil and chaos.
"He was directly involved in the deaths of American soldiers and innocent civilians, and his reign of terror was rightfully ended."
"As a veteran, I recognize the importance of peace through strength."
Iran was given multiple warnings – but chose to continue its belligerent behavior and threaten U.S. troops and diplomats.
"Justice was served, and I’m extremely grateful for our troops and members of the Intelligence Community who completed this mission."
I then headed to Concordia Retirement in Bella Vista to share a cup of coffee and conversation with some great Arkansans.
"We talked about a variety of topics, including Social Security, Medicare, what is happening with Iran, trade, and the deficit."
"I also shared some of my priorities in Congress: a strong defense, lower taxes, secure borders, and continued economic growth."
It’s important that I hear directly from the people I represent!
"I thank them for the invite, warm welcome, and great discussion."
"Next week, Congress will be back in session."

"Dear Friend, With Christmas just a couple days away, I wanted to take a minute to wish you and yours a very Merry Christmas."
"And to my Jewish constituents, Happy Hanukkah and may the Festival of Lights bring blessings upon you and your families."
"For those of you traveling this holiday season, please stay safe and enjoy this special time with friends and family."
Last week wrapped up a busy stretch in Washington as Congress prepared to break for the holidays.
"After months of time wasted on partisan political theater, House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump."
"The only bipartisan aspect of the entire impeachment process was the votes in opposition, as several Democrats voted with my Republican colleagues and me against impeaching the President."
"Unfortunately, it was only a matter of minutes before the double-talk began."
"In yet another shameful display of what the American people absolutely despise about Washington, after representing to the American people that it was an urgent matter of national security to impeach the President, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are now delaying sending the articles to the Senate while they attempt to rig another unfair process."
The House also considered and passed two separate packages to keep the government funded.
"The first package contained four appropriations bills: Defense, Homeland Security, Financial Services-General Government, and Commerce-Justice-Science."
"The second package contained eight appropriations bills: Agriculture-FDA, Labor-HHS-Education, Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, State-Foreign Operations, Transportation-HUD, Military Construction-VA, and Legislative Branch."
"While much more needs to be done to restrain spending and address our debt, there are a few provisions from these packages I am pleased to highlight."
"In the first package, we not only provided funding for the border wall, we were successful in removing geographic restrictions on its construction."
We provided our brave men and women in uniform with a much deserved 3.1% pay raise while continuing to prioritize rebuilding our military after years of neglect by the Obama Administration.
And we shut down attempts by the Democrats to weaken pro-life protections.
"The House also passed the Conference Report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20 NDAA), which sets policy for the Department of Defense, authorizes funding for its programs, strengthens our national security and supports our men and women in uniform."
"Of particular note was the inclusion of one of President Trump’s chief priorities, the creation of the Space Force, which will be the sixth branch of the military."
"Lastly, the House passed President Trump’s United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is a massive win for American workers and our economy."
Continue reading for more information on the USMCA and impeachment sham.
"United States Mexico Canada Agreement Passes the House Last week, the House passed the USMCA which is a major win for our economy."
"America’s workers, farmers, and manufacturers will be buoyed by this agreement as it will add 176,000 new American jobs and bring in over $68 billion in new economic activity."
This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation.
"By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive."
"Impeachment Sham Despite any evidence of a crime committed by the President, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have rushed this partisan impeachment sham in an attempt to overturn the 2016 election."
"By operating in secret, disregarding facts and evidence, and instructing witnesses not to answer Republican questions, this absurd abuse of power by Democrats has failed to reveal an impeachable offense and certainly has come nowhere close to the threshold necessary for impeachment."
Speaker Pelosi directly contradicted her previous statements that impeachment must have bipartisan support and the only bipartisan votes taken were the votes against impeachment.

"Dear Lindsey,  Senator Tammy Baldwin has voted for the final version of the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 that includes a number of measures that deliver results for Wisconsin."
The final version of this defense funding bill now heads to the President’s desk for his signature.
"“I voted in favor of this bipartisan defense authorization legislation because it makes important investments to strengthen our national security and support our service members and their families,” said Senator Baldwin."
"“In particular, I am pleased the final bill includes a pay raise for our troops and gets rid of the widow’s tax."
"It makes sure that federal Small Shipyard grants support American workers and businesses, and authorizes funding for a number of projects important to Wisconsin’s military personnel and our Made in Wisconsin economy.”   Supporting Service Members and Military Families  The bill includes a 3.1% pay raise for service members and eliminates the military widow’s tax."
"Senator Baldwin is a cosponsor of the bipartisan Widow’s Tax Elimination Act that was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA) to repeal the law that prevents as many as 65,000 surviving military spouses nationwide from receiving full Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs survivor benefits."
Strengthening Buy America Standards for Small Shipyard Grants Program  Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan legislation to strengthen Buy America requirements for federal Small Shipyard Grant funding was included in the final NDAA.
"The measure will support American businesses, manufacturers and workers."
"While Buy American requirements already apply to the Small Shipyard Grant Program, there is a loophole in the Maritime Administration’s rules that allow these federal grants to be used to purchase foreign-made equipment."
"Baldwin’s provision in NDAA will close this loophole to support American businesses and workers like Marine Travelift in Sturgeon Bay, which employs nearly 200 workers and uses Wisconsin-sourced materials to manufacture boat handling equipment that is exported around the world."
Reinforcing Navy Shipbuilding in Wisconsin  The bill includes more than $1 billion in initial funding for the Navy’s Future Frigate.
"Fincantieri Marinette Marine is competing to build this future ship in Wisconsin, which will continue to support Senator Baldwin’s priority of expanding good-paying Made in Wisconsin shipbuilding jobs."
"The final defense funding bill also included Baldwin’s amendment to require certain Navy ships to be built using domestic diesel engines, like those produced by Fairbanks Morse Engine in Beloit."
"Additionally, the bill includes Baldwin’s bipartisan amendment to direct the Navy to examine how it can bring more Navy maintenance work to Great Lakes shipyards."
"Protecting Workers against China’s Attempts to Undermine American Industries  Senator Baldwin, along with Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), secured their amendment in the final NDAA to prevent federal funds from being used by transit agencies to purchase rail cars or buses manufactured by Chinese state-owned, controlled, or subsidized companies."
"The Chinese government continues to use a range of state subsidies and predatory practices to support its market ascension in certain sectors of the United States’ economy, including rail manufacturing and bus manufacturing."
This amendment would prevent federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese rail assets and ensure transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan to protect American industries and national security.
Boosting Wisconsin Manufacturers  The final NDAA includes an increase of $130 million for Oshkosh Defense’s Tactical Wheeled Vehicles.
"Investing in Hi-Tech Careers in the Chippewa Valley  Senator Baldwin secured an amendment requiring a plan from the Department of Defense to leverage commercial supercomputing for defense, allowing the U.S. and Wisconsin to continue advancing American leadership in supercomputing, provide critical technology to our most difficult research and computational questions, and accelerate the deployment of new computer technology."
Cray Computing in Chippewa Falls has been building the world’s leading supercomputers for decades and will be competing to develop and build the next generation of supercomputers.
"To compete with countries like China, the Department of Defense must begin taking advantage of the innovation, science, research and technology presented by the commercial sector."
"Dear Friend,   Another week, and more of the same here in Washington."
"As Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats continue their partisan impeachment sham, they have now introduced Articles of Impeachment."
"Even though they don't have the evidence and have orchestrated an unfair process, they have put the goals of their far-left wing base ahead of their responsibility to serving the country."
"On another note, after a year of dragging her feet, Pelosi has agreed to President Trump's United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."
The House has also considered the Conference Report for the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act in order to fund our national defense and give our men and women in uniform the resources they deserve.
"United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement After the Democrat majority held off a floor vote for months while playing politics, Speaker Pelosi has finally agreed to President Trump's trade deal and will bring the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to the House floor for a vote."
As a member of the committee that handles trade – the House Ways and Means Committee – it has been an honor to work with Ranking Member Kevin Brady and other Committee members to support the efforts of President Trump and the administration to renegotiate NAFTA.
This is clearly a better deal for American businesses and workers.
This agreement will level the global playing field for American businesses and implement policies that will build upon the growing successes we have seen from tax reform and deregulation.
"By opening new markets for the United States to sell more American products abroad, the outlook for our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, tech workers, small businesses, and American consumers is once again positive."
"After years of sluggish recovery, our economy is booming again and growing 50 percent faster than projected."
"America is once again the most competitive place in the world to do business and thanks to the hard work of President Trump, the USMCA will help continue that growth."
"I was proud to be the conservative voice in the room at the White House to emphasize the trade priorities of my neighbors in the Third District, and again in Ottawa with Ways and Means Committee members to voice the importance of this trade agreement."
"As Chief Deputy Whip, I will have the honor of working alongside Republican Whip Steve Scalise to deliver a big vote in support of President Trump’s trade deal."

"Four of our bills were included in this year's National Defense Authorization Act, a bipartisan must-pass piece of legislation."
"These provisions will provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave to federal workers, protect military bases from extreme weather events, improve the emergency alert system, and help crack down on child pornography."
Hawai‘i will also receive $26 million in new federal disaster relief funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"This brings the total federal disaster relief funding for recovery from the 2018 storms, Hurricane Lane, and the Kilauea eruptions to more than half a billion dollars."
"As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai‘i if there is anything we can do."
"Mahalo,     Brian Schatz  United States Senator                Schatz Legislation Expected to Become Law Several pieces of legislation authored by Senator Schatz are set to become law after being included in the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)."
The legislation was introduced as individual bills and incorporated into the bipartisan NDAA package.
"The four provisions are:  Providing Paid Parental Leave for Federal Workers  This bill provides two million federal workers with 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child after birth, adoption, or the initiation of foster care."
"Although the current Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care of a new child, it does not provide any paid leave."
Studies have shown that providing paid leave for federal employees would save the government at least $50 million annually in turnover and replacement costs.
Federal agencies are already struggling to recruit and retain young talent.
"Just 6 percent of the federal workforce is under the age of 30, while roughly 40 percent of the workforce is eligible to retire within the next three years."
"Improving the Emergency Alert System  The Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats (ALERT) Act, which was introduced by Senator Schatz following the false emergency alert that went out across Hawai‘i in January 2018, will improve the emergency alert system and give the federal government the primary responsibility of alerting the public of a missile threat."
State and local governments have been largely responsible for alerting the public of threats from natural disasters and severe weather.
"With various government agencies issuing alerts, the system has relied on an inconsistent patchwork of technologies and procedures established by each agency."
"The false alarm in Hawai‘i highlighted some of the weaknesses in the state’s emergency alert system, which had a poorly designed user interface and did not have a sufficient verification system or computer redundancies to help prevent mistakes."
The incident made clear the need for federal standards in the system and called into question the state’s responsibility to issue a missile alert.
Protecting Military Bases from Extreme Weather  The Requiring Every American Defense Installation to Nullify Environmental Stresses for Security (READINESS) Act protects military bases from extreme weather events by requiring them to prepare for potential disasters and other risks posed by severe changes in environmental conditions.
"The new law will require that all Department of Defense bases have military installation resilience plans that:   Include the current risks and threats to military resilience resulting from extreme weather events, change in sea level, flooding, and wildfires—and describe the impact on critical infrastructure inside and outside the military base that are necessary to its mission; Include the future risks and threats to military resilience during the 50-year lifespan of the base resulting from extreme weather events and other environmental conditions; Describe the projects necessary to mitigate the identified risks to the military base—including the costs and types of agreements with community stakeholders necessary to execute the military installation resilience plan; and Use projections from recognized governmental and scientific entities, such as the National Academies of Sciences, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S."
"Global Change Research Office, to inform future risk assessments."
"Fighting Trafficking of Child Pornography  The End National Defense (END) Network Abuse Act will help the Pentagon stop the unacceptable use of the Defense Department’s (DoD) network to view, possess, trade, procure, and even produce child pornography."
"Across the internet, more than 45 million online images and videos of child sexual abuse material were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children."
"In 2018, the DoD’s network ranked 19th out of 2,891 networks nationwide when it came to peer-to-peer file trading of child pornography."
Coupled with these troubling statistics is a lack of training and law enforcement tools for the DoD to take on child sexual exploitation.
"The END Network Abuse Act would upgrade the training and technical capacity of military criminal investigative organizations to confront the misuse of the DoD’s computers, facilities, and equipment to access and trade child pornography."
"It would also require the DoD to enter into collaborative agreements with appropriate federal, state and local law enforcement entities, child protection organizations, trauma informed health care providers, and targeted social services."
Securing Federal Disaster Relief Funding The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that Hawai‘i will receive $26 million in new federal disaster relief funding.
"The new Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding adds to the $71 million announced earlier this year, and will help state and local governments rebuild impacted communities, especially in low- and moderate-income areas, and provide resources to help businesses recover."
"Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, worked with federal agencies and state and county officials to ensure Hawai‘i submitted a strong application to receive the maximum amount of funding."
The new funding allocation was part of the $1.7 billion housing disaster recovery package Congress passed last year.
"With the $26 million in housing and community development grants announced today, Hawai‘i has now been allocated more than a half a billion dollars in federal disaster relief funding to help the state recover from the historic storms in April 2018, Hurricane Lane, and the eruption of Kilauea on Hawai‘i Island including:   $15.3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in individual assistance to help people who have lost their home; $205 million from FEMA in public assistance to help local and state governments clean up and repair public infrastructure such as facilities, parks, and water lines; $93.1 million from the Department of Transportation to help rebuild roads and highways; $80 million from the Department of the Interior to help repair damages at the Hawai‘i Volcanoes Observatory and the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge; $71 million from the Department of Housing & Urban Development for housing and community development; $47.2 million from the Small Business Administration in subsidized loans to help individuals and businesses pay for repairs not covered by insurance; $4 million from the Department of Labor in Disaster Unemployment Insurance to help those who lost their job temporarily or permanently because of a disaster and are not eligible for regular unemployment benefits; and $187,000 from the Economic Development Administration to provide technical assistance for economic development activities in disaster impacted areas."
"The Senate Committee on the Climate Crisis, chaired by Senator Schatz, also held a hearing on how we can help communities rebuild after severe weather."
"To watch the hearing, click here."
"Protecting Our Personal Data Online Senator Schatz, the top Democrat on the Senate Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee, led a group of 16 senators in reintroducing legislation to protect people’s personal data online."
"The Data Care Act would require websites, apps, and other online providers to take responsible steps to safeguard personal information and stop the misuse of users’ data."
"Doctors, lawyers, and bankers are legally required to exercise special care to protect their clients and not misuse their information."
"While online companies also hold personal and sensitive information about the people they serve, they are not required to protect consumers’ data."
This leaves users in a vulnerable position: they are expected to understand the information they give to providers and how it is being used – an unreasonable expectation for even the most tech-savvy consumer.
"By establishing an explicit duty for online providers, Americans can trust that their online data is protected and used in a responsible way."
"Senator Schatz also questioned witnesses at a Commerce Committee hearing entitled ""Examining Legislative Proposals to Protect Consumer Data Privacy."""

"This week, Senator Rick Scott released an episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money."
See previous Washington Waste Wednesday features HERE.
"This week's episode covers the Green New Deal, a socialist Democrat proposal that would cost as much as $93 trillion and destroy the nation’s economy."
What socialist Democrats fail to understand is that you don’t have to choose between caring about the environment or growing the economy – you can do BOTH.
"Throughout his time as Governor of Florida, Senator Scott made record investments in the environment, which he was able to do because of Florida’s booming economy."

"—  Sen. Rick Scott: UN Cooperation with Communist China is Dangerous  Senator Rick Scott made the below statement following reports that the United Nations’ standards for facial recognition, video monitoring, and city and vehicle surveillance are being shaped by Chinese tech groups."
"Senator Rick Scott said, “By putting Nicolas Maduro on its human rights council, the UN proved that it has no respect for human rights."
"Now, the UN is highlighting its complete disregard for privacy and national security by allowing Communist China to control facial recognition standards."
"Dear Friend,  As we gathered around the Thanksgiving table last week, I was full of gratitude for the grace of God, a loving family, and the privilege of serving the good people of West Texas."
"It is truly an honor to represent you and your families in our nation's capital, and as we head into the final weeks of 2019, I encourage you and all of our fellow West Texans to follow me on Twitter and Instagram and like my page on Facebook to get the latest updates on our work to restore power back to We the People."
"Military Family Month  During Military Family Month in November, I highlighted the families of two local military heroes at Dyess Air Force Base."
"At the change of command ceremony earlier this year, outgoing Base Commander Col. Brandon Parker had a surprise for his family."
"As a reward for always being strong and rolling with the punches that come with being a military family that moves every few years to new places, he announced that he's taking them to Disney World - a well deserved treat!"
"Filling his shoes, Dyess’ new Base Commander Col. Ed Sumangil is excited to be back in Abilene, where he was married and two of his children were born."
"Every month, we're grateful for the spouses, children, and loved ones who serve alongside our troops."
"Passing USMCA, Delivering A Win For America  The new and much-improved North American trade deal, USMCA, is being held up by House Democrat leadership who are more concerned with playing political games than adding over 176,000 new jobs and $70 billion to our nation's economy."
"Despite the assurances they have been provided to address concerns about enforcing labor and environmental standards, Democrats are continuing to move the goal posts and put partisan politics over prosperity as they delay passage of USMCA to focus on their impeachment inquisition of President Trump."
"Click here or on the image below to watch my conversation on Fox Business Network about the prospects of passing USMCA before the end of 2019:    Standing Up For West Texas Beef Producers  When I'm home in West Texas, the cows tell me how bad the Green New Deal is."
"While that is a joke, the radical proposals promoted by Democrats are a serious threat to our agriculture and energy economies in the American heartland."
That's why I was proud to stand up for Texas beef producers in a recent Trade Subcommittee hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Click here or on the image below to watch my full remarks:    National Meat Judging Champions!
"Speaking of beef, last month the Texas Tech University Meat Judging team took home their 14th national championship title - an all-time record!"
"With Texas boasting more heads of cattle than 43 states have people, it comes as no surprise that these outstanding Techsans know their meat!"
"Please join me in giving coach Mark Miller and the entire team a big West Texas congratulations on this incredible accomplishment, and read more about the history-making team in their Sports Illustrated profile from earlier this year:    Empowering Rural Health Care Providers  As co-chair of the House Ways and Means Committee's Rural Health Task Force, I am committed to advancing bipartisan solutions to the current rural health care crisis to improve the lives of our fellow West Texans and rural America as a whole."
That's why I introduced the Accountable Care In Rural America Act before the Thanksgiving holiday to change the incentives of our health care system to reward quality over quantity while reducing the cost to taxpayers over time.
"I am confident that this bill will empower rural health care providers, reduce costs to both patients and taxpayers, and strengthen the health and well-being of our families living in America's breadbasket and energy basis."
"Learn more about the rural health care crisis and what my bill does to address its challenges in this 1-minute breakdown from Fox West Texas:    West Texan Leads 2020 Country Grammy Nominees  Seminole native Tanya Tucker is leading the field with a whopping four nominations for the 2020 Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album, Best Country Solo Performance, Best Country Song, and Song of the Year."
"Home to artists like Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings, and the Josh Abbott Band, District 19 has a rich history of musical greatness, and we are extremely proud that Tanya will be flying the West Texas flag at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in January!"
"Bidding Farewell to a Fellow West Texan  Last week I joined my fellow Texans to honor the outstanding career of our fellow West Texan, outgoing Secretary of Energy Rick Perry."
"Wrapping up a lifetime of public service, including as the longest-serving Texas governor in our state's history, Secretary Perry is leaving behind an incredible legacy for American energy dominance."
"Dear Friend,  Last Sunday morning, the American people woke up to news that we had all longed to hear: that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS and the world’s number one terrorist, had been brought to justice by our brave American service members."
"The death of this depraved individual is a huge win for America and all the civilized world, and it sends a clear message to those that would use terrorism to pursue their evil ends that they cannot escape the long and mighty arm of the United States military."
I thank our President for his decisive leadership in ordering this raid and our special operatives for their courage and bravery in undertaking this extremely dangerous operation.
"Tricking the American People From Day 1 of Donald Trump's presidency, House Democrats have tried dressing up their impeachment inquisition as a legitimate inquiry instead of what it really is: a purely political ploy aimed at discrediting and destroying our duly-elected President."
"That’s why it is only fitting on Halloween, Democrats tried to put a costume of credibility to disguise their political witch hunt of Donald J. Trump and distract from their radical, socialist policies – which should scare all Americans."
House Democrats’ relentless pursuit of this impeachment scam is hurting our ability to get things done on behalf of the American people like passing USMCA and passing legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
"In fact, this Congress, Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have had bills signed into law."
"It’s past time for Speaker Pelosi’s political theater to exit stage left so we can get back to doing our jobs, debating the real issues, and solving real problems."
Bringing the Prescription Drug Pricing Process Out of the Darkness All Americans are rightly concerned about the ever-rising costs of prescription drugs.
One of the reasons why drug costs have spiraled out of control is because discounts negotiated by the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)– the middle-men in the drug supply chain – are shrouded in secrecy.
"Americans are left in the dark about the rebates these PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers, and while we have no idea where the rebate value is going, we know where it’s not going – to our seniors at the point of sale."
"To that end, I’m proud this week the House passed bipartisan legislation I led that provides more transparency in an otherwise opaque process that will help ensure rebates go towards reducing the cost of drugs for seniors."
"This legislation also includes the text of my bill, the Shop Rx Act, which requires drug plans for seniors to offer real-time information regarding the various options of drugs and their associated costs."
"By providing seniors with access to the readily available, relevant information they need in order to be real consumers in the healthcare market, we will empower them with the knowledge to choose the options that best fit their needs and their budget."
"And because consumers will have more information, they will have more choices and insurers will have to actually compete for their business, which will ultimately bring down the cost of drugs- something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on."
Click here or on the image below to watch my remarks from the floor in support of my legislation.
"Ushering in American Energy Dominance At the heart of America’s economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy."
"American energy independence is undoubtedly a matter of national security, but it's also a question of life & death for our rural communities."
"In West Texas, energy producers are as crucial to our communities as our educators, healthcare providers, & ag producers."
"Click here to watch my remarks opposing HR 2181, Democrat-led legislation that would ban future mineral development in an area outside the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which would put a choke-hold on energy production by our New Mexico neighbors and members of the Navajo Nation tribe."
"Jobs, Jobs, Jobs We continue to see more great news come out about our economy, which was once again confirmed with the latest jobs report."
"October’s numbers showed the economy added 128,000 jobs last month, exceeding economists’ expectations."
This is just goes to show that President Trump and Republicans’ pro-growth policies have brought greater freedom in the marketplace are helping Americans keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets where it belongs.
"Now it’s time to keep our foot on the pedal by passing USMCA and ushering in the 176,000 new jobs that this better, fairer trade deal will deliver."
"Hometown Hero Earlier this week, Lubbock Police Department Officer Thomas Thompson, a finalist for the Police Officer of the Year Award, was honored by President Trump at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in Chicago."
"Officer Thompson is part of a long line of defenders of our democracy as guardians of the public safety and the Rule of Law, and we are all grateful to his bravery and service to keeping the Lubbock community secure and our families safe."

"This week, Senator Romney introduced the Time to Rescue United States Trusts (TRUST) Act, which would create congressional committees specifically tasked to develop legislation to restore and strengthen these endangered federal trusts funds."
A summary of the legislation can be found here.
"In a speech on the Senate Floor, Senator Romney spoke about how it's irresponsible for Congress to keep ignoring a preventable crisis."
The TRUST Act would put in place a responsible process now to prevent dramatic cuts to programs or massive tax hikes down the road.
"The TRUST Act is also sponsored by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Todd Young (R-IN), Doug Jones (D-AL), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)."
Senators Romney and Manchin spoke to CNBC's Squawk Box about their legislation to rescue federal trusts funds.

—  Sen. Rick Scott on Senate Floor: Let’s Work Together to Lower the Cost of Healthcare for Americans  Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate Floor about the Democrats’ latest attempt to prevent states from having any flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens.
Senator Scott is working on real solutions to lower the cost of healthcare for Americans.
Read excerpts of Senator Scott’s remarks as prepared for delivery below or his full speech HERE.
What we’ve heard this week from my Democrat colleagues on healthcare is just more of the same.
"More fear-mongering, more misinformation."
The issue this week is what’s called 1332 Waivers.
These waivers allow states flexibility in how they implement healthcare programs.
It’s a simple concept.
Every state is different.
"Every state should have the flexibility to design their healthcare programs and regulations in a way that best fits the needs of their citizens.…  But here’s the problem…the Democrats don’t believe in state’s rights, or allowing state taxpayers and citizens ANY flexibility to provide better healthcare services to their citizens."
"The Democrats want these top-down, one-size-fits-all federal programs."
"If there is choice and flexibility, they want to restrict it."
"It’s how big government works, and the Democrats love big government, restrictive mandates, and socialism.…  We need to reduce healthcare costs and provide a safety net for those who cannot afford their healthcare, not create a federal government-organized healthcare market, which causes healthcare costs to skyrocket."
Giving flexibility to the states is an easy way to increase access and quality of care for the American people.…  Enough with the misrepresentations.
Enough with the nonsense.
Enough with the fear mongering.
The American people deserve better.
"Let’s work together to lower the costs of healthcare, so all taxpayers can get the care they need at a price they can afford."
Sen. Rick Scott: We Need to Fight for the Values that Made America Great  Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Washington Examiner to share his personal story and priorities as a United States Senator.
"In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, “… Even though my Mom had no money, she was optimistic and hopeful."
"She told us we were blessed because God and our founders created the greatest country ever, where anything was possible.…  While I didn’t always appreciate my tough-love, my-way-or-the-highway Mom growing up, I now thank God every day for my Mom and this country."
She gave me the opportunity to experience every lesson this country had to offer before I was 20.
"Unfortunately, the left has worked hard over the last 50 years to discredit the values of the America I was raised with and the values of the America I want my grandsons to grow up with."
"We all acknowledge that Americans, our country, and our institutions have flaws, but the left has worked to discredit our founders, our institutions, our churches, our law enforcement, our morals, and almost everything my mom taught me.…   The values that I grew up with, the ones my tough-love mom taught me, are becoming a way of the past."

Healthy Outcomes Start Now A Policy Forum on Prevention in Bangor     Often lost in the debates about who should pay for healthcare is how much we pay for healthcare – and it’s just too much.
"Americans pay the highest per capita costs for healthcare, but our health outcomes don’t reflect that."
"We need to fix that, and we can start by motivating people towards healthier lifestyles."
"In mid-October, I held a discussion on prevention in Bangor with local healthcare providers and public wellness experts on the best ways to use prevention strategies to improve health outcomes and reduce costs."
The cheapest medical procedure is the one that doesn’t need to happen – we should figure out ways to prevent issues before they get serious.
"The voices at our event in Bangor had important ideas on how to find solutions that will improve both our health and our wallets, and I'm bringing their insights back to Washington as I push to make prevention a healthcare priority."
"Scenes from Maine   University of Maine Unveils the World's Largest 3D Printer   Maine made history on October 10, 2019 by unveiling the world's largest 3D printer and largest 3D printed object: a boat!"
"The event marks the latest innovative investment in Maine’s forest economy, which will serve to increase sustainability, advance the future of bio-based manufacturing, and diversify our forest products industry."
"It's a huge opportunity for the state of Maine, limited only by our imaginations."
I’m grateful to everyone involved — especially the University of Maine and the FOR/Maine initiative — for their work to make this day a reality.
22nd Annual Togus Stand Down for Homeless Veterans   Maine’s veterans have made immense sacrifices to ensure our national security and they’ve earned our unwavering support – that’s why events like the Annual Stand Down at Togus VA Medical Center are so important.
"The 22nd Annual Stand Down represents an all hands-on-deck approach to veteran care so these men and women can face these challenges head on and lead happy, healthy lives."
It’s up to us to ensure that these heroes have the resources and means to improve their quality of life and build a path forward.
"By bringing together organizations that support veterans struggling with homelessness, substance use disorders, and mental health complications, we can connect those in need with those who can help."
"Touring Aroostook County   At the Aroostook Area Agency on Aging, I spoke with folks about Medicare, drug prices and more."
These are kind people who are working to make their communities better places to live for Maine seniors.
They are making a real difference — I’m grateful for their work.
"The Aroostook County Action Program helps residents get back on their feet in the face of homelessness, addiction, unemployment and more."
"They are a support system in every sense of the phrase – so impressed by them and their work, which is vital for the county."
"During my Aroostook community visits, I was excited to see the innovations underway at the University of Maine at Presque Isle."
"From agricultural facilities to a new cybersecurity program, they’re investing to help get students ready for the 21st century workforce; these efforts will benefit the County, state, and country in years ahead."
"Ribbon Cutting Ceremony of World's First Agriculture Focused Credit Union   Maine’s farmers and food businesses make vital contributions to our state, which is why it is so important that they have the tools they need to succeed."
This event marked a milestone for farmers – the nation’s first credit union uniquely focused on serving the agricultural community!
"The Maine Harvest Federal Credit Union will combine the community-focused approach of credit unions with agricultural expertise, allowing our farmers to access specialized support that will help them thrive."
"This opportunity, will open new doors for Maine farmers — I’m thrilled to see what comes next."
"Thoughts from Senator King Congress Must Follow the Facts in Impeachment Inquiry  This column appeared in the Portland Press Herald and the Bangor Daily News on October 8th, 2019     We are in the midst of a difficult and dangerous period."
"Over the past two years, I have been a conservative on impeachment; one of my heroes is William Pitt Fessenden, a Maine senator just after the Civil War who cast one of the deciding votes against the impeachment of Andrew Johnson."
"(This vote, which threatened to end Fessenden’s political career, was featured in John F. Kennedy’s “Profiles in Courage.”) He believed then (as I do now) that overturning the results of an election should be an absolute last resort and should not be based upon policy or political differences between the Congress and the president."
"But when a sitting president admits to using the power of his office to openly solicit the engagement of a foreign government in his re-election campaign (President Zelensky – “We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins [anti-tank missiles] from the United States for defense purposes.” President Trump – “I would like you to do us a favor though…”), it’s hard to argue that beginning a formal process to get all the facts is unjustified."
"Just in the first week of the House inquiry, more disturbing facts – and new questions – have arisen."
"Texts between administration officials suggest the possibility of a pretty explicit quid pro quo, in fact several."
"Investigation of Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid, for a call with the president, or for a visit to the White House."
"Additionally, the role of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr must be examined and clarified."
"And finally, the president’s extraordinary public statement requesting that China investigate the Bidens."
"Such a request to a foreign country with regard to any American citizen would be unusual, but when that American citizen happens to be the son of one of the president’s potential political opponents, the request is less about policy than the personal political interests of the president."
"In fact, this entire matter seems to rest upon this president’s inability to distinguish between the national interest and his own personal interest."
"Only this can explain his continuous characterization of the Zelensky call as “perfect,” in spite of his repeated requests that Ukraine investigate his political rival as shown in the White House-released summary of the call."
"This also explains his frequent misuse of the word “treason,” which is defined (in the Constitution itself) as “only in levying war against them (the United States), or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.” Criticism of the president, even strong criticism of the president, or a whistleblower reporting possible wrongdoing by the president, is not treason, it is democracy."
"Our entire constitutional system is built upon the principle of checks and balances, expressing in concrete terms the Framers’ deep concern about the grave dangers of power concentrated in one set of hands."
"The separation of powers, fixed terms of office, vetoes, Senate confirmation of Cabinet and judges, ratification of treaties, the power to declare war and others are all there to ensure that power is shared and that, ultimately, we are protected from those who might abuse the power lent to them by the people."
"And so it is with impeachment, the ultimate check on a public official’s betrayal of their trust."
"As a potential juror in an impeachment trial, I will make my final decision only after weighing the facts and evidence established by the process now underway in the House."
"Although I believe that this process may well be politically advantageous to the president, it seems to me that those of us who took an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic …” at this point have no choice but to follow the facts, wherever they may lead."
"This is a solemn and historic moment, and it cannot be avoided."
"As usual, Abraham Lincoln captured the essence of times like these, “Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history."
"We, of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves."
"No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us."
"Hello Folks - Earlier this month, Congress and the American people lost an incredible human being and a tireless public servant in Representative Elijah Cummings."
Elijah worked so hard for his community and to make government work better.
It was an honor to work with him and to consider him a friend.
I think every American should take a few moments to watch the ceremony last week in the United States Capitol celebrating and honoring his life.
"Democrats and Republicans alike spoke of Elijah’s unwavering service to the people he proudly represented, his commitment to working together despite political differences to find lasting policy solutions, and his devotion to fighting for what’s right to move our country forward."
"Elijah spoke often of the stories of those he was fighting for - of the friends and neighbors he met at community gatherings, his church, and in everyday life."
He brought those stories with him to Congress and fought tirelessly on their behalf.
"His approach served as a reminder to me - and to so many others over the years - to carry the voices of the folks we represent with us to Washington D.C., to vigorously support what’s right, but to show kindness, compassion, and civility to one another."
May Elijah rest in peace.
Read on for details for how I’ve been bringing those values to Congress.
"Lowering Prescription Drug Costs  Before his passing, Rep. Cummings was a leading voice in the battle to reduce the costs of prescription drugs."
"Across this country, we know that rising drug prices are a huge burden for seniors, hardworking families, and everyone in need."
Our country has seen amazing innovations that have saved lives and reduced suffering.
"But far too often, those innovations are out of reach because people can’t afford them."
"In the greatest country on the planet, no one should be forced to have to skip their medications or choose between food and medicine."
That’s why I’m excited to report that the House is working on a vitally important bill - H.R.
"3, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act."
"This bill aims to level the playing field for patients, ensuring they have access to less expensive medications."
"Beyond that, the bill is expected to save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars."
"Let me share some details... To ensure that we don’t see massive cost hikes and to limit out-of-pocket costs, the bill takes some critical steps."
"Importantly, it requires our government to negotiate prices directly with the drug companies in hopes of driving down prices."
That notion of negotiating isn’t a new idea - it’s a way for government to be more efficient.
You’ve seen that drug price negotiation happen within the Veterans Administration.
"You’ve even seen negotiation required under Medicare for hospitals, doctors, home health agencies, medical equipment providers, and others."
"But currently, under Medicare, drug companies set their own prices."
"To respond to this, H.R."
3 gives Medicare the power to negotiate directly with the drug companies and creates powerful new tools to secure real price reductions.
"It also makes the lower drug prices negotiated by Medicare available to Americans with private insurance, not just Medicare beneficiaries."
"In addition, one of the most common concerns I’ve heard from people is a basic frustration that Americans are charged more than folks in other countries for the same drugs."
"Historically, we’ve been willing to subsidize poorer nations in hopes of reducing preventable deaths and suffering."
"But, there’s a real frustration that, under the current system, we are also subsidizing countries like England, France, Germany, Australia, and Japan."
That would end under H.R.
"Beyond that, the bill creates a new, $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries."
Limiting the amount people pay has the potential to save lives and prevent medical bankruptcies.
"Because the bill generates such substantial savings, it enables some of those savings to be reinvested in innovation and the search for new cures and treatments through the National Institutes of Health."
The bill is currently working its way through the committee process (having gone through three committees!).
I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to pass this bill in the coming weeks!
"As I’ve written previously, the House has passed - and I’ve supported - several other bills to try to reduce drug prices."
"Protecting Our Elections  Last week, the House passed the SHIELD Act, a bill I played a lead role in sponsoring to combat interference in American elections."
"This bill closes loopholes that allow foreign spending in our elections, boosts disclosure and transparency requirements, and creates a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign nations or governments."
"As many of you know, I’ve visited every nook and cranny of our region."
"And I’ve never - ever - heard someone say, “You know, we should make it easy for foreign interests to play a role in American elections.” Rather, in every corner of our region, there’s widespread agreement that foreign interests should have no role in our democracy."
That’s not a Democratic notion.
It’s not a Republican notion.
It’s an American notion.
"Sadly, over the past few years, countless intelligence assessments have confirmed vulnerabilities in the American election system and just this week, one of the world’s most prominent social media companies acknowledged that foreign adversaries like Iran, Russia, and China are already actively working to interfere in our next election."
That’s why the SHIELD Act is so important.
"I was proud to speak on the House floor about the importance of a bill I introduced, the Honest Ads Act, which was included in the SHIELD Act."
"Sponsored by 18 Republicans and 18 Democrats in the House, and by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Mark Warner in the Senate, this bill will ensure Americans know who is paying for the online ads they are seeing and make it harder for foreign actors to use the internet to attack our democracy."
I am hopeful that the Senate will take action without delay to further protect our elections.
"Advocating for Paid Family Leave  As most of you know, I’m the proud father of two amazing young girls."
"When my oldest, Sophie, was born on April 4, 2006, my life changed forever (for the better!)."
"In those first few weeks, I felt incredibly lucky to work for an employer that said I could take the time I needed to be with my family."
"And while Sophie is now a healthy 13-year-old, those first two years involved a lot of medical appointments."
"Because of paid parental leave, I didn’t have to worry about whether my job would be there when I came back."
I didn’t need to worry about our family’s financial security.
My employer had my back.
"It made me acutely aware of just how critical paid parental leave is, and it made me want to ensure that that my neighbors, friends, and family, have paid family leave too."
"When you welcome a new family member into the world or have to care for an ill family member, you should be able to have some peace of mind."
"Unfortunately, the United States is one of the few countries on the planet that does not have a policy of paid leave for new parents."
"In fact, just 17 percent of working people have paid family leave through their employers to care for a new child or sick family member."
"I’m proud to be from Washington state for a number of reasons, but one thing I’m particularly proud of is that our state is moving to implement a comprehensive paid family and medical leave plan early next year."
"I believe Congress should move to ensure that no matter where you live, you have access to paid family and medical leave."
"It's important for families, for moms and dads, for children, and for employers who want to retain skilled workers."
That’s why I’m a proud sponsor of The FAMILY Act to establish a system of paid family and medical leave here in the United States.
"Research has found that policies like this lead to better family financial stability, a stronger business climate in which more people can participate in the workplace, and a reduction in the use of public assistance programs."
"Last week, I was proud to be a Dad-vocate and speak about how important a comprehensive paid family leave program is for our country."
I’ll continue to fight that we make progress on this front.
Working for You  Celebrating Allen AME Church  I enjoyed the opportunity to celebrate two big birthdays at Allen AME Church in Tacoma!
Pastor Anthony Steele (shown here with his son) just turned 55.
"And then this past weekend, the church celebrated its 130th year in Tacoma."
Thanks so much to Pastor Steele and the entire Allen AME family for the warm welcome.
"Advocating for Individuals with Disabilities  The Center for Independence (CFI) serves as an important resource for individuals with disabilities, helping people fully access and participate in the community."
I valued the opportunity to visit with the CFI team and to learn more about their priorities.
I'm co-sponsoring several bills to ensure individuals with disabilities have educational opportunities and important community-based services.
Every person should have an opportunity to fulfill his or her dream.

President Trump recently declared October to be National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
This is a great opportunity to review your online habits and make sure you are safeguarding your information.
Here are some tips from the Federal Trade Commission:   Update Your Software: Outdated software is easier for criminals to break into.
Keeping your software up to date helps protect against the latest threats.
"Protect Your Personal Information: When asked for your personal information, think about why this person might need it and whether you can trust their request."
"Protect Your Passwords: Use strong, unpredictable passwords with at least 10 characters."
"Don’t use the same password for different accounts, don’t share your passwords, and if you write one down, keep it out of plain sight."
"Consider Turning On Two-Factor Authentication: For accounts that support it, two-factor authentication requires both your password and an additional piece of information to log in to your account."
"Give Personal Information Over Encrypted Websites Only: If you’re shopping or banking online, stick to sites that use encryption to protect your information as it travels from your computer to their server."
Back Up Your Files: Copy your files to an external hard drive or cloud storage.
"If your computer is attacked by malware, you will still have access to your files."
"For more tips on safeguarding your information online, visit the FTC website."

"This week, I sent a letter to House Leadership requesting full access to all transcripts and materials related to the impeachment investigation of President Trump."
"Dear Lindsey,  It has been quite a week in Washington, D.C."
"The so-called ""impeachment inquiry"" is stumbling ahead."
This week I sent a letter to Chairman Adam Schiff requesting documents and records related to the work being undertaken by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
"I want Chairman Schiff to explain to the American people why he has chosen to ignore precedent and bar non-committee members from being present in the committee, even though those members would be voting on whether or not to impeach the President."
This process needs to be opened up.

The Congressional App Challenge is open to middle and high school students of all coding abilities and the last day to submit an app is November 1st.
"I’ve recruited local tech leaders and innovators to judge the competition, and the winners will be honored at the capitol."
"Dear Friends-  Striving to protect the privacy of all citizens, including small business owners, has been a priority throughout my time in Congress."
"My commitment to protecting privacy, in addition to alleviating regulatory burdens on small businesses, is why I opposed the Corporate Transparency Act (H.R."
"2513), which the House passed on Tuesday."
"Coming from the business world before serving Ohio’s eighth district, I understand the red tape that business owners face."
Some of my colleagues think it’s worth forcing business owners to collect and submit more personal information to yet another federal database.
"However, the argument does not hold that creating this burden is necessary due to a handful of criminals using anonymous shell companies to hide their identities and launder money."
Law enforcement already has other means to obtain this information from other databases.
I think Americans’ privacy is too precious to sacrifice.
"I offered an amendment to solve the problem by other means; and when that failed, I offered a motion to require law enforcement to at least obtain a subpoena before being granted access to such a database."
"Unfortunately, my efforts did not secure enough votes in the House, but I am hopeful that the Senate will fix this misguided bill and protect Americans’ civil liberties and ensure small businesses are not crushed by yet another federal mandate."
This Week in Financial Services Committee   This week Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg drew much attention at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.
"I had the opportunity to question Mr. Zuckerberg about Facebook’s new electronic payments project, Libra."
My concerns with Libra include the amount of influence Facebook would have on developing the currency and how the tech giant plans to protect consumer privacy.
This hearing provided a great opportunity for lawmakers to consider the need for regulatory clarity for blockchain and cryptocurrency.
"My solution, The Token Taxonomy Act (H.R."
"2144), would provide a framework for blockchain startups and established crypto companies alike."
Creating this framework is essential for the growth and development of blockchain technology in the United States.
The SEC still regulates companies from an outdated 1934 framework and does not provide necessary clarity for innovation and growth.
"My goal is to create a standard set of rules and regulations for this emerging industry, paving an avenue for growth and innovation inside the U.S. so that coming generations of Americans will reap the economic benefits of the technology."
"Visiting Upper Valley Medical Center   Lastly, yesterday I had the chance to tour Upper Valley Medical Center in Troy."
"It was gratifying to visit this high-tech medical facility, which offers top-grade medical care for those of us in the eighth district."
UVMC provides many of the resources we need to continue providing the best healthcare possible.
We discussed some of the biggest challenges that healthcare providers face.
Feedback like this is very helpful as Congress considers different approaches to achieve meaningful healthcare reform.
Thank you for taking the time to keep up with the work I am doing on your behalf in Washington and at home in Ohio.
"I encourage you to stay connected with our office through my , , Instagram, and  pages."
"Congressman Ben McAdams (UT-04) Dear Friend, I had the chance to question Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a House Financial Services Committee hearing."
"As a father of four, I knew just what to talk to him about: child safety online."
"[image = [link 1] Keeping my kids, and your kids safe is a top priority."
The role that online social networks play in the lives of kids causes me stress and keeps me up at night.
"*I wanted to know what more Facebook can do, and should do, to keep kids safe."
* I questioned Mr. Zuckerberg about encrypted messages on the popular WhatsApp that is owned by Facebook.
Encryption is a double-edged sword.
It increases privacy for individual users but makes it difficult to detect child predators targeting children.
"With plans to apply the same encryption to Facebook Messenger, I think there is both cause for concern and an opportunity to find a solution that protects kids."
Facebook was founded with innovation at its core.
*I believe we can have encryption and more secure platforms while still ensuring we protect our children*.
It's important that tech innovators provide both.

"Dear Lindsey,  Southeast Michigan lives and breathes manufacturing—and our kids are no exception."
I recently had the pleasure of welcoming 700+ amazing middle school students at Schoolcraft College in Livonia to kick off Manufacturing Day 2019.
"Manufacturing Day is an opportunity for students to get a firsthand look at what today’s engineers, technicians and other staff do each day at advanced manufacturing facilities across the region."
"Companies of all sizes opened their doors to provide a close look at their design labs, testing centers and manufacturing operations."
Students heard directly from working professionals about their jobs in manufacturing and what skills are needed to attain them.
Should Congress create more opportunities for students to engage in early childhood STEM education?
Yes   No      Click here to take Survey      It's my job to listen to Michigan families.
Please take my survey and join my email updates.
Rep. Stevens addresses middle school students during a Manufacturing Day event in Livonia.
"Credit: Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center  The goal of Manufacturing Day is to inspire students to explore the broad range of high-paying, fulfilling job opportunities in southeast Michigan and discover if there is a career just right for them."
"If we are going to address our workforce challenges in Michigan, we must embrace opportunities like Manufacturing Day to expose students to STEM concepts and help them find their passion in manufacturing at a young age."
"I have spent my career in economic and workforce development, creating job training programs and bringing manufacturing opportunities to students throughout the Midwest."
"In Congress, I’ve continued working to ensure that our children are prepared to thrive in the 21st century economy."
"As Chairwoman of the Science, Space & Technology Research and Tech Subcommittee, I am proud to have introduced multiple bipartisan bills to improve and strengthen manufacturing in our district, including the Building Blocks of STEM Act and the American Manufacturing Leadership Act, both of which recently passed the House of Representatives with unanimous bipartisan support."
"Respectively, these bills ensure STEM funding is more equitably allocated to younger students, with a focus on young girls in STEM, and strengthen our nation’s network of manufacturing institutes, two of which are in southeast Michigan, that work together to maintain U.S. leadership in advanced manufacturing and workforce development."
"Michigan is already home to the greatest workforce in the nation, and with initiatives like these, it only grows stronger."

Vela with Anthony at the ""Down"" by The Border Movie Event."
"""Down"" by The Border Movie Event  I had the privilege of participating in the “Down” by The Border Sensory Movie Day Event in Brownsville, TX."
“Down” by The Border is a non-profit organization that helps children with special needs in the Rio Grande Valley.
"“Down” by the Border’s mission is to enhance quality of life for those with down syndrome, and they support these exceptional families through public awareness, and advocacy."
The day began with the distribution of entrance bracelets followed by a sensory viewing of Dora the Explorer.
I had the opportunity to speak with the parents of these resilient children.
It was a wonderful experience to see their excitement as they gathered to watch the film.
"Co-Founders, Dolores and Sergio Zarate, are committed to making an impact in our community by serving special needs children and their families."
They have created a network of community organizations that come together to provide needed resources to families.
"The nonprofit group held multiple events this summer, including a movie day, fishing day, and the “My Buddy Cop Dance.” Thank you for inviting me to join this very successful event."
"I wish all the kids a fun, productive, and safe school year!"
Rep. Vela with members of the Port Isabel Veterans United group.
Rep. Vela Meeting with Members of the Port Isabel Veterans United Group I visited with members of Port Isabel Veterans United in my district office earlier this month.
The organization includes veterans and community members who devote their time to assist other veterans and people in need in our community.
I learned about their experiences with the Veterans Administration and their ideas to improve services for veterans and their families.
"I enjoyed connecting with these veterans and advocates, and I look forward to continuing to work together to ensure that we honor them with the respect, health care, and compensation that they deserve."
Rep. Vela meeting with Steve Verett and the Plains Cotton Growers.
"Rep Vela Visits with Plains Cotton Growers and ARMtech in Lubbock Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of meeting with Steve Verett and the Plains Cotton Growers at their bi-weekly roundtable meeting and with Michael Smith of ARMtech."
"As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management, it was a privilege to meet with some of the great producers and insurers in West Texas."
"Rep. Vela meeting with ARMtech, Michael Smith and his team."
"In my meeting with ARMtech, Michael Smith and his team showed me how precision software development leads to enhanced crop insurance coverage."
They use state-of-the-art technology to provide their clients with up to the minute quotes for policies which are custom-tailored to their individual production needs.
"October 18, 2019 Dear Friend, In New Mexico, we know that water is life."
"Particularly in an era of prolonged droughts and climate disruption, we must do all we can to responsibly provide clean water supplies and protect our limited water resources in every corner of our state."
"If we are going to do that, we must use the best available science as our guiding light."
"Earlier this month, I visited some of our state's leading water scientists at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources, located on the campus of New Mexico Tech in Socorro."
Hydrogeologists at the Bureau are mapping our state's aquifers and monitoring the groundwater we all rely on.
"Senator Martin Heinrich meets with Senior Geochronologist Matt Heizler at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources, October 1, 2019."
"During my visit, I met with State Geologist Dr. Nelia Dunbar, Hydrogeology Program Manager Stacy Timmons, and Deputy Director and Associate Director for the Mapping Program Dr. J. Michael Timmons."
"We discussed their latest research findings, which include new details on the complex workings of the aquifer below the Plains of San Agustin."
"For years, I have stood with local community leaders in western New Mexico who are fighting against a speculative proposal to pump and transport billions of gallons of water far away from Catron and Socorro Counties."
"Senator Martin Heinrich examines 3D aquifer maps with State Geologist Dr. Nelia Dunbar (left) and Field Geologist Colin Cikoski (right), October 1, 2019."
"I also visited the Bureau's Photogrammetry Lab, where a team of geologists and New Mexico Tech students is using modern tools like ArcGIS and traditional field mapping to create 3D maps of our state's aquifers and basins."
"As we try to better understand how the climate crisis will affect New Mexico, accurate data and detailed maps of all of our groundwater resources is essential to ensure our water administrators make wise long-term decisions about how to best use and conserve our limited freshwater supplies."
You can count on me to always advocate for scientifically sound and smart investments in New Mexico's water infrastructure.
I hope you can stay in touch with me about this and other issues important to you and your community.
"Dear Lindsey,  To help support veterans who are interested in new careers, Senators Tammy Baldwin and John Hoeven (R-ND) have reintroduced their bipartisan legislation that will make flight-training services available for veterans to become commercial airline pilots."
"“America’s veterans have bravely served our nation and we have a shared responsibility to make sure their service and sacrifice is honored,” said Senator Baldwin."
“Our veterans have also earned every opportunity to be productive and successful after completing their military service.
This legislation increases opportunities for veterans looking to pursue flight training and careers as commercial airline pilots.
We have a real need for qualified pilots and if we make the training more available to veterans we can provide them with a good paying job.”   Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan American Aviator Act will authorize grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support training opportunities for veterans who are not already military pilots.
"Veterans participating in the program will receive flight training necessary to become a commercial pilot and receive other certifications, including to work as a certified flight instructor."
The legislation helps ensure there are enough qualified pilots in the future to continue providing safe and reliable air service to rural airports across the country.
"Senator Baldwin at Fox Valley Tech announcing her bipartisan American Aviator Act on October 11th   Fox Valley Technical College, Air Wisconsin, Appleton Airport, the Air Line Pilots Association and the Regional Airline Association agree Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan bill takes the right approach and support her American Aviator Act:   “The American Aviator Act provides veterans with solid high paying jobs while ensuring the viability of air transportation throughout our country and beyond."
"Veterans bring all the right elements to the table,” said Dr. Susan May, President of Fox Valley Technical College."
"“Their work ethic, determination, and professionalism make them the perfect candidates to help move our air transportation industry forward.” “The aviation industry is in dire need of qualified aircraft pilots."
"The American Aviator Act taps into a strong applicant pool of future pilots, who may otherwise not be able to afford financially to get into the industry,” said Jared Huss, Chief Instructor and Aeronautics Department Chair at Fox Valley Technical College."
"“This act does two important things; supports our Veterans and supports the stability of our communities’ air service.”   Fox Valley Tech currently offers flight-training for veterans to become certified airline pilots, and works with Air Wisconsin and Appleton Airport to put more individuals on the path to a successful career as pilots."
Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan reform would build on this successful model to ensure that more veterans in Wisconsin and across the country could pursue this career path after completing their military service.
Flight-training schools that have established pathways to employment with commercial air carriers are eligible for federal grants to recruit and enroll veterans for flight training.
"Grant funding may be used to provide guidance and flight-training services, including additional training required to reach proficiency."
"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Baldwin also successfully secured $1 million in federal funding to support flight-training schools looking to expand and serve more veterans."
"This week, Senator Rick Scott delivered his maiden speech on the Senate Floor to share his personal story and his vision for America."
Watch his speech or read excerpts of his remarks as prepared for delivery below.
"My story begins with my Mom.… Even with no money, my mom was always optimistic and hopeful."
"She told us we were blessed because God and our founders created the greatest country ever, where anything was possible.… Unfortunately, the Left has worked hard over the last fifty years to discredit the values of the America I was raised with – the values of the America I want my grandsons to grow up with."
"We all acknowledge that Americans, our country and our institutions have flaws, but the Left has worked to discredit our founders, our institutions, our churches, our law enforcement, our morals, and almost everything my mom taught me.… I spent most of my life in business."
"The values that my tough-love mom instilled in me helped me achieve the success she expected – not just hoped for, but expected – for me."
I was able to live the American Dream because I worked hard.
"I lived out the values my mom taught me in my business career – hard work and fiscal responsibility, but with a caring spirit to support those around me.… My experience growing up in a family that struggled to get good jobs influenced everything I’ve done in my life."
"It’s not easy, and it shouldn’t be."
"But everyone – every single American – should have that opportunity to struggle, work hard, and overcome the obstacles."
I took those same values to the Governor’s office when I got elected in 2010.
Florida had been struggling.
"832,000 jobs lost in the four years before I took office."
Home prices cut in half.
The state raised taxes on its poorest citizens by more than $2 billion to fill a budget hole.
I always think about my mom.
"I think about how it impacted her when food prices went up, taxes went up, when my brother got sick without health insurance, and when my dad was laid off."
I became the jobs governor.
"It wasn’t a political talking point, it was about real people.… In eight years, Florida added 1.7 million new jobs, we paid down almost one-third of state debt and invested record funding in education, the environment, and transportation."
"But I also tried to fight for the values that are being lost in this country – I fight to protect life, to support the institution of the family, to lift up our military members, veterans and law enforcement, to promote capitalism and to defend the rule of law and the constitution.… In my short time in the U.S. Senate, I’ve promoted policies that I believe support the idea of an America where anything is possible."
We need lower taxes and less regulation.
We need a secure border and a sane immigration policy.
We need to get health care costs under control.
We need to defend freedom and liberty around the world.
But none of this will matter unless we see hearts and minds change.
We need a renewal in America of the values that made this country great.
That won’t happen on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
"It will happen in living rooms, and classrooms, and churches, synagogues, and board rooms.… This challenge is much bigger than politics."
And the solution is not political.
It requires us – every one of us – to stand up and fight.
To say without reservation or fear that we WILL NOT give up on America or the plans of our Founders.
We WILL NOT stop fighting for our future.
"If we want America to be great in the future, we must reject the politically correct attempts to rewrite our history, and we must reject the left-wing attempt to slander the greatness of our ideals."
"America is in fact the greatest country in the history of the world, and we should not be embarrassed to say so – we should proclaim it proudly.… I fear that the values that I grew up with – the ones my tough-love mom taught me – are becoming a way of the past."
"But, I believe these values – these virtues – can and should be part of our country’s future.… In the meantime, I’ll keep fighting."
I ran for public office to fight for the country I was raised in because that is the country our children and grandchildren deserve.
They deserve what my mom gave me – a free country with unlimited potential for every citizen.
I hope everyone will join me in this fight.

Sen. Rick Scott Announces TIPS Act to Address FBI Failures  Senator Rick Scott joined family members of the victims of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to announce his Threat Information Protocol for Sharing (TIPS) Act to hold the FBI accountable for its failures to address critical deficiencies in its handling of actionable intelligence.
"This legislation is supported by Stand with Parkland, an organization founded by the family members of the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting."
"Senator Rick Scott said, “Not a day goes by that I don’t think about the 17 souls that were taken from us in a brutal act of violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."
"Following the tragedy, we all worked together to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act to make our schools safer and prevent future tragedies, but we aren’t finished."
"We cannot accept the repeated failures of the FBI to properly investigate and act on specific tips received about the Parkland shooter, as well as other perpetrators of mass violence in Florida."
"Dear Lindsey,  New Mexico is an amazing home for technology, and our kids are in a great position to learn more and take advantage of the good paying and high tech opportunities for their future."
"Earlier this year, I invited middle and high school students to join my district-wide Congressional App Challenge to encourage students to learn tech skills to keep up with increasing demand for people who have familiarity with coding."
"By participating, students will learn to code, manage a project, and have an opportunity to have their app displayed at the national level."
This year's deadline is November 1 and fast approaching.
"If you know any students who may be interested in learning more tech skills, encourage them to create a new app."
"If they want to put their skills to the test, they can learn more on the official ."
"Sincerely,  Member of Congress  P.S."
"If you are interested in following my work for you more closely, please sign up for my newsletter here."
"You can also follow me @RepDebHaaland on , , and ."
"Dear Friends,  I had another wonderful week working at home in the District last week, including four Brad as Your Business visits, the chance to meet with some outstanding young leaders at Rockland Elementary School and Zion-Benton New Tech High School, and, always a highlight, attending the naturalization ceremony for 126 new Americans from 40 different countries."
Now I am writing to you today from Washington with Congress back in session.
"On the agenda for this week: the Outsourcing Accountability Act, which would hold publicly-traded companies  accountable for outsourcing American jobs by requiring them to disclose where their jobs are located, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Disclosure Effectiveness Testing Act to make the disclosures made to individual investors – those of us who are not experts in financial products – more clear and concise."
We also have hearings in both the Ways and Means Committee (focused on lowering the cost of prescription drugs) and the Small Business Committee (focused on management of the Small Business Administration).
"On a separate track, the impeachment inquiry into the President’s actions surrounding Ukraine is ongoing."
"The various House committees are continuing their important investigative work interviewing witnesses, including Monday of Fiona Hill, President Donald Trump's former top Russia adviser, and yesterday of State Department deputy assistant secretary George Kent."
The Committees are also issuing  for relevant documents and the ability to interview related individuals.
"At question is the very serious charge that the President has abused the power of his office, worked to undermine the integrity of our elections, and subordinated our national security for his personal and political gain."
It is imperative that Congress conducts its investigations in a deliberate and comprehensive manner.
I remain committed to following the facts to whatever conclusion they lead.
"Looking ahead to later in the month, we are hosting a free health and wellness fair in Waukegan on Saturday, October 26, and a Congress on Your Corner town hall in North Chicago on Sunday, October 27."
More details are included below – I hope you can join us!

NEIGHBORHOOD OFFICE HOURS Our constituent service representatives hold  in communities across the Tenth District to more easily meet with constituents about any casework needs.
My team will be in Des Plaines and Glenview this week.
"If you need assistance with a federal issue, from Medicare and Social Security to Immigration and the VA, please come see us!"
"WEEKLY WRAP-UP     In Washington, I’m working to bring down the cost of higher education so our students don’t graduate with crushing debt."
"At home, I hosted a Financial Aid 101 session in Waukegan to help students and parents understand the FAFSA and other available resources."
There wasn’t a dry eye in the house to witness the naturalization of new American citizens from more than 40 countries at a ceremony at the Chicago Botanic Garden.
It is always my great privilege to thank these new citizens for choosing us and to welcome them to their home.
As the song says: “Proud to be an American.”       It’s always humbling to join the entire community in North Chicago to welcome home local veterans from their Lake County Honor Flight trip to DC.
Thank you for your service.
Daniel and Hazel Krauklis both served our country in World War II - Daniel in the Army Air Corps and Hazel in the Women’s Army Corps.
They also recently celebrated 68 years of marriage together!
It was a privilege to honor them at a ceremony in Libertyville and to present them with a copy of the Congressional Record with my statement saluting their service to our country and love for each other.
"On Tuesday, I met with the Optimists Club of Deerfield, and visited with seniors in the LivingWell Club at North Shore Place in Northbrook, followed by a number of constituent meetings in our Lincolnshire office."
You can request a meeting using the        I participated in a National Coming Out Day event in Libertyville to celebrate the bravery of those who have made the choice to live openly as their authentic selves.

#NationalComingOutDay       It was great (and early) start to the morning with the Sunrise Rotary Club in Zion!
"Following our meeting, I had the opportunity to visit with students at New Tech High School."
Last week I toured Fresenius Medical Care’s clinic in Highland Park to learn more about their work providing dialysis services.
They have 10 facilities helping more than 700 patients in our district.
Did you know Clorox has a manufacturing facility here in the Tenth District?
"I appreciated the opportunity to visit their site, hear from their team, and discuss ways to foster more manufacturing in our economy."
"Dear Friend,  Last week marked another successful Twin Cities Startup Week."
"This annual event is always a great opportunity for entrepreneurs, engineers, and individuals in the tech sector to come together to share ideas, network and prove that the Twin Cities are the ""Startup Capital of the North""."
Minnesota is poised to be a capital of fintech innovation.
"In addition to our 17 Fortune 500 companies, we have numerous startups and have attracted venture capital totaling almost $500 million."
"Our finance and insurance sectors already employ approximately 150,000 Minnesotans, a figure that is significantly larger than the national average."
"In addition, the greater metro area has been ranked the third best city for startups in the nation."
Congressman Emmer sharing a federal update on FinTech development at the Future Finance Forum during Twin Cities Startup Week.
"As a member of the House Financial Services Committee as well as the Committee’s Taskforce on Financial Technology, and a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus - I am in a unique position to advocate for Minnesota on fintech issues, as well as focus on the intersection of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency."
Fintech stands to dramatically empower the individual and promote access for those who have previously been excluded.
It is important that regulators provide clear rules of the road that ensure even the smallest startup with a brilliant idea can become a major enterprise.
"That is why I introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, which provides that certain blockchain-related entities that never take control of consumer funds do not need to register as a money transmitter."
"Examples of these entities include ""miners"" that validate network integrity and multi-signature providers that enhance security."
"To further support this mission I introduced the Main Street Growth Act, which will allow the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to provide for the creation of venture exchanges."
These specialized securities exchanges would help small and emerging growth companies gain access to the capital they need to grow and succeed.
The bill would also establish an Office of Venture Exchanges under its Division of Trading and Markets to study and monitor the effectiveness of these new exchanges.
Minnesotans can help lead the next digital revolution.
Change is coming in the ways we use money and the financial opportunities available to us.
We have an opportunity to embrace this change and foster these new innovations.

"Dear Friends:  Recently, I traveled to Indianapolis, IN, to participate in a national convention celebrating manufacturers and products that are made in America."
The idea and team behind this convention hail from our very own Lake County.
"Many months ago, Lake County Businessman Don Buckner shared his vision for this with me."
I was immediately excited.
Hello Folks - Fall is upon us!
The leaves are changing colors.
The Seahawks are 5-1.
The Kilmer Family Halloween decorations are up.
And I even had to de-frost my windshield a couple of times last week.
It’s officially autumn.
Even the school year is moving along.
"This week, we’ve got Parent-Teacher Conferences."
It’s always amazing to hear about the outstanding work our educators are doing.
Those who follow me on Facebook and Twitter know I visit a lot of schools.
It’s persistently inspiring to learn about the work that educators are doing on behalf of our students.
"In fact, in the last two weeks, I visited nine different campuses."
"Among other things, I did student town halls at the University of Puget Sound and Tacoma Community College."
"For National Principals Month, I got to give a shout-out to Shani Watkins from West Sound Tech in Bremerton."
I visited with the new leadership at TCC’s Gig Harbor campus.
I met with the student leaders at the University of Washington - Tacoma and Olympic College.
And I even learned how to weld and draw blood at Peninsula College.
"As the son of two school teachers and as the father of two school-aged daughters, I think a lot about our education system and the challenges that our students face as they prepare to step into the workforce."
"No matter what campus I am visiting, I hear from students who are particularly concerned about college affordability."
"I’m working hard on that, and even just introduced a bill to help students and their families."
"Giving Students in Need Access to More Financial Aid  We know that education is the door to economic opportunity and for a lot of families, financial aid programs are the key to that door."
Pell Grants are particularly important for middle class and less-well-off families.
"But even with that vital support, students and their families often end up saddled with debt."
"For long-time readers of my newsletter, you’ll know that I’ve been working to increase the purchasing power of Pell Grants."
I’ve sponsored bills to increase the maximum grant award and to expand eligibility for the Pell Grant.
I successfully sponsored an effort to make sure Pell Grants are available year-round.
"Additionally, earlier this month, I introduced bipartisan legislation called the Pell Plus Act of 2019."
This new bill will promote college completion by establishing partnerships between colleges and universities to provide a Pell Grant bonus to low-income students in their third and fourth years on a path to on-time graduation.
Our bill assures that on-time graduates receive the same amount of Pell Grant assistance as those who take six academic years to earn a degree.
"Ultimately, the net effect of this proposal would be to triple the amount of Pell Grant assistance during the final two years of study for students who are on track to complete their studies within four years."
That’s a big deal for students and their families.
"The Pell Plus program will help students complete their college degree on-time, provide more financial aid, and lower their debt burden."
"This is a win for students, a win for educational institutions, and a win for local employers who are hungry for workers."
"Combating Foreign Interference in American Elections  Foreign interests shouldn’t be able to influence American elections, period."
"With countless intelligence assessments confirming vulnerabilities in the American election system, and another election just over a year away, it’s vital that both sides of the aisle come together to take real action to protect our elections from foreign interference."
"This week, I was proud to be a lead co-sponsor of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, which will make a massive effort toward doing just that."
The SHIELD Act will:   Create a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign governments and their agents.
"Help prevent foreign interference in future elections by improving transparency of online political advertisements (through a bipartisan, bicameral bill I championed called the Honest Ads Act)."
Close loopholes that allow foreign nationals and foreign governments to spend in U.S. elections.
Restrict the exchange of campaign information between candidates and foreign governments and their agents.
Prohibit deceptive practices related to voting procedures.
"I was proud to see the Honest Ads Act, which is co-sponsored by 18 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the House, included in this legislation."
This bill will ensure Americans know who is paying for the online ads they are seeing and to make it harder for foreign actors to use the internet to attack our democracy.
It’s been a priority of mine for a long time - and you can read a great write-up of what the bill would do from the News Tribune.
Congress should take action to further protect our democracy without delay.
I’m hopeful that this bill will pass the House by the end of the month.
"Building Civility  There is a lot of division in our country these days and frankly, it takes work to try to find common ground."
I’m a big believer that part of the way to better understand where people are coming from is to actually see where people are coming from.
"With that in mind, I’ve been doing some “civility exchanges” over the last year in which I invite one of my Republican colleagues to visit our region and I go visit theirs."
"Last year, I visited eastern Washington with my Republican colleague Congressman Dan Newhouse, and I hosted him here."
"Earlier this year, I hosted Congressman Steve Womack, the Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, in our neck of the woods, and last week I visited his district in Northwest Arkansas."
"When Rep. Womack visited our region, I had the opportunity to highlight the ways the federal budget affects the unique culture and economy of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula."
He toured Olympic National Park to learn more about the maintenance backlog and legislation I’m leading to address it.
We visited the Port of Tacoma and discussed the importance of trade and improving our freight mobility.
We toured Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to talk about the impacts of government shutdowns on federal workers and the need for infrastructure investments.
"Last week, I participated in the reciprocal visit."
"While in Arkansas, I spent a day and a half learning more about the local economy, the opportunities and challenges of the region, and the people that live there."
"We toured businesses big and small, held a student town hall at the University of Arkansas, and talked to folks about the issues they’re facing in everyday life."
"I appreciated being able to visit northwest Arkansas and learn more about that part of the country, the people that live there, and what that means to Congressman Womack’s approach to his job."
"He and I don’t agree with each other on everything - in fact, we disagree on a good chunk of things."
"But I’m a believer that we’ve got to be able to talk through issues, listen to each other, and not have everything turn into the Jerry Springer Show."
"When Democrats and Republicans make the effort to understand one another’s perspectives, our country has a better shot at making progress on key issues facing the American people."
Providing Opportunities for Students to Attend U.S. Service Academies  One of the best parts of this job is being able to consider students for nominations to our nation’s military service academies.
"Every year, there are a lot of great applications and reading through them makes it pretty clear to me that our region’s future is in good hands."
"On October 23 at 5:30 at the Bremerton School District Administration Building in Bremerton, Team Kilmer will be hosting an information session for interested students to learn more about the application and admission process to these academies."
"Students who are unable to attend, or who have questions about the application process, should contact my Tacoma office by calling 253-272-3515."
You can also check out more information about the application process on my website!
"The Return of “Quick Questions About Congress with Kilmer”  As a lot of you may know, over the years I’ve hosted a podcast called “Quick Questions About Congress with Kilmer.” I’ve heard from a lot of you that you missed these unique interviews, so I wanted to let you know that it’s back in action!"
"For those of you new to the show, the podcast is meant to build understanding between lawmakers, forge new relationships, and create an avenue so members can work together to tackle critical issues facing our country."
It’s also an opportunity for people around the country to learn more about the folks who serve in our nation’s capital.
These conversations help lead to collaboration on policies to help our constituents.
"For example, the bipartisan Pell Plus bill I introduced earlier this month was done in partnership with Episode 11 guest Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks."
"Last year, I passed the Stop School Violence Act, a bill to make schools safer and prevent gun violence, working in partnership with Episode 19 guest Congressman Ted Deutch."
Episode 22's guest is Congressman Tom Graves from northwest Georgia.
"We talk about southern hospitality, bipartisanship, and our collaboration on the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress to make Congress work better for the American people."
Working For You  Checking in on Progress at the Boys and Girls Club  I had a great time visiting with my friend Norma Turner and the great team from the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Olympic Peninsula.
I can’t wait to see the new finished clubhouse in Port Angeles.
Hearing the Stories of our Tribal Communities  ‪It was an honor to join the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians at their annual fall conference at the Suquamish Resort.
Listening to their stories has made me a better supporter for Indian Country.
"Supporting Healthier Communities  The boat moves best when all oars are in the water, rowing in the same direction."
It was inspiring to meet with the Olympic Peninsula Healthy Community Coalition; a group of amazing organizations focused on improving health and wellness in our region.
Thanks to Commissioner Mark Ozias for his leadership and for the invitation.
"Supporting our Workers  Last week, I was able to meet with a terrific group of leaders from the IFPTE Local 12 from the Shipyard."
I also visited with my friends Larry Brown and April Sims from the Washington State Labor Council.
I stand with them in supporting workers’ right to organize and negotiate better wages and working conditions.
I appreciate their partnership in working for an economy that works better for everyone!
Eating a Ton at Oyster Fest!
It was another fantastic afternoon at the 38th Annual Oyster Fest in Shelton!
I got to be a timer for an oyster shucking competition.
I got to pour beer in the beer garden (and have some awesome discussions with folks I represent).
I got to present awards to local wineries.
And I got to eat a ton of shellfish.
"ICYMI: WE MUST EXPAND TELEHEALTH FOR VETERANS In case you missed it, I wrote an article in The Hill this week about the need to expand telehealth for veterans and legislation I introduced to address this."
Click here to read my article.
"We must expand telehealth for veterans By Rep. Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter The 1st District of Georgia has a rich military heritage and one of my greatest honors is serving the service members and veterans in Southeast and Coastal Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives."
"Although a couple hours from home, many of our veterans travel to Charleston, S.C., or Lake City, Fla., in order to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital and medical facility."
"I, too, often visit these facilities to see how we can improve the care these heroes receive."
"On a recent visit to the Charleston facility, we discussed a number of barriers that are standing in the way of better care for veterans."
One serious concern is the VAs current limitations on telehealth.
"The VA Mission Act, which I was proud to support in Congress and was later signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017, reformed multiple programs at the VA."
"It overhauled the Veterans CHOICE Program, improved the veterans caregiver program and aimed to modernize the VAs health care facilities."
"Additionally, the VA Mission Act authorized the VA to provide telehealth services across state lines."
This is critical because these VA health facilities are now able to give care to veteran patients in the First District without forcing those veterans to travel hours to South Carolina or Florida to be seen by a physician.
"However, while were making important strides in telehealth at the VA, there is still a big problem."
"While at the Charleston VA medical facility, I learned that only doctors are allowed to use telehealth systems and trainees are not permitted to use the program."
"Just like in any health care system, students, interns, residents and fellows are critical components of the VA."
They use these professionals in every aspect of care.
These medical providers have graduated medical school and are training to become full-time doctors.
They need access to the telehealth system so they are able to get the experience necessary to provide the best possible care to veterans once they are fully licensed.
"Additionally, allowing this population of health care professionals to use the telehealth system will increase access to this important care by increasing the number of providers."
That is why I introduced H.R.
"3228, the VA Mission Telehealth Clarification Act in the United States Congress."
My legislation authorizes trainees to use the telehealth program under the supervision of an appropriately credentialed VA medical professional.
This will allow better access to VA health care as well as better prepare future doctors to use the system.
Our veterans served our nation and deserve access to the best possible care when they return home.
Increasing the use of telehealth at VA health centers is critical to ensure veterans are able to receive the care they need no matter where they live.
"The VA Mission Telemedicine Clarification Act is only one small step to improve the health care system for veterans, but it is an important step that should be taken immediately FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXXXVII Monday, October 7, 2019: Now in its fourteenth year, the Buddy Walk, sponsored by the Lowcountry Down Syndrome Society (LDSS), is held in Forsyth Park in downtown Savannah every year and this past Saturday drew thousands of people."
LDSS is a family support group for people in the greater Savannah and Lowcountry area that have been touched by Down syndrome.
I was very proud to join my brothers from the Band of Brothers on Saturday as we supported our good friend and fellow member Joe Marchese and his beautiful daughter Ella at the Buddy Walk.
"Rep. Carter at the Buddy Walk This is a special event for me, as well, as I grew up with an aunt who had Down syndrome and have fond memories of the joys and challenges my grandparents had raising a child with Down syndrome."
My Aunt Jean was an integral part of our family.
She was always accepted and included everywhere we went.
I can still remember my family going out to eat at Williams Seafood in Savannah with my grandfather in his suit and tie with his arm extended and my Aunt Jean holding on as if he were walking her down the wedding aisle.
Later Saturday morning I was able to stop by the Georgia Republican Leadership Academy held at the American Legion Post 184 in Thunderbolt to speak to them.
"On Sunday afternoon I was back at Forsyth Park as I attended one of the best events anywhere, Picnic in the Park, Savannahs largest outdoor musical event."
"Rep. Carter at Picnic in the Park Sponsored by the City of Savannah and others, this beloved event featured not only students from local schools and colleges, but also the US Army 3rd ID band and, of course, the world-class Savannah Philharmonic."
Im in Atlanta today as I have a number of meetings in the area before joining Governor Brian Kemp and others at the Georgia GOP 2019 Chairmans Dinner.
"Tuesday, October 8, 2019: After arriving back home late last night, my first event of the day is at the Georgia Tech Savannah Campus as I speak at the Georgia Alternative Fuel Vehicle and Clean Technology Showcase and share with them my experiences as a member of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee."
"As a member of the E&C Environment Subcommittee as well as the Select Committee on Climate Change, we have considered many bills dealing with autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, compressed natural gas vehicles, and much more."
"Rep. Carter at the Georgia Alternative Fuel Vehicle and Clean Technology Showcase Afterwards, I head to our Savannah office where I have a very productive meeting with a representative from the Savannah Freedom Society followed by a meeting with representatives from Twin Pines Minerals regarding their proposed project in Charlton County."
"Next, I meet with representatives from Coastal Empire Habitat for Humanity to learn more of the great work they are doing in the Savannah area before heading to Hinesville in Liberty County to meet with constituents from Liberty and Long Counties."
"Afterwards, I head to Cogdell in Clinch County where I meet with a number of constituents from the area."
"Wednesday, October 9, 2019: Im up early this morning as I head to the Coastal Heritage Society Battlefield Memorial March in downtown Savannah where we honor those who fought and sacrificed for our freedom on the 240th anniversary of the Battle of Savannah during the Revolutionary War."
Rep. Carter at the Coastal Heritage Society Battlefield Memorial March The Battle of Savannah was one of the Revolutionary Wars most pivotal battles and is where Gen. Casimir Pulaski was killed.
"Complete with soldiers clothed in uniforms from that period who marched along the same path as the original battle, participants laid wreaths in Battlefield Park during a commemorative ceremony."
"Afterwards, I head out to Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool in Bryan County where I read to a group of preschool classes in celebration of Georgia Pre-K Week."
"Rep. Carter with students at Richmond Hill Montessori Preschool Of the three books that I read, I have to say that my personal favorite was Llama, Llama Red Pajama."
"Afterwards, I head to midtown Savannah for a meeting with a constituent before heading to the Savannah Area Realtors Luncheon at the Hellenic Center in downtown Savannah where I am honored to be their guest speaker."
"Thursday, October 10, 2019: Im at Lake Raybun in North Georgia this weekend for my youngest sons wedding and this morning I have a conference call with my good friend Col. Daniel Hibner, Commander of the Savannah District of the US Army Corp of Engineers, to discuss a project in the district."
"        News from Representative David Cicilline                            October 11, 2019         Dear Friend,  President Trump, without consulting with our allies and at the request of the thuggish President of Turkey, undermined American national security by greenlighting Turkey’s attack on our Kurdish allies in the Middle East."
Kurdish troops in Syria did what the President never has – they signed up to fight alongside the American military.
The Kurds have been a critical ally in our fight against ISIS.
The President’s decision to abandon them now is a betrayal.
"It is wrong, and it will make it harder for our allies to trust that we keep our word."
I led several of my colleagues this week in pressing the Pentagon for answers on why the President abruptly changed course in Syria and abandoned one of our most trusted allies.

"Big Tech  As you may know, I am currently leading an investigation into the market power controlled by big technology companies, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon."
I recently spoke with The Boston Globe about the status of our work and where things will go from here.
I’ll be sure to keep you updated on the progress we are making and the ways this investigation will benefit consumers.
Next Week  I will be introducing major legislation next week to help young people pursue education past high school without incurring mountains of debt.
The Making College More Affordable Act will ensure that every young person can take out student loans without accruing interest.

"Impeachment  Every day, it seems, President Trump manages to admit more crimes and dig a deeper hole for himself."
"Last week, in fact, he admitted on camera to actions that Republican Senator Mitt Romney said are unacceptable."
We cannot allow our democracy to be destroyed like this.
Asking a foreign country to interfere in an American election is an impeachable offense.

10 News Conference  I just finished taping a 30-minute discussion with Gene Valicenti for 10 News Conference that will air this weekend on Channel 10.
"Dear Friend,  Friday was National Manufacturing Day and yesterday marked the end of Minnesota Manufacturing Week."
"As one of the main drivers of the economy, manufacturing generates billions of dollars in revenue each year for Minnesota, and provides an impressive 292,000 manufacturing jobs for Minnesotans across the state."
"Altogether, 33 percent of Minnesota’s total workforce is connected to the manufacturing lifeblood of the state."
"Currently, our state and nation is facing a skills gap crisis that has shown no signs of slowing down, and the tech sector is desperately looking for more employees."
"In fact, the United States is expected to have 1.8 million unfilled tech jobs by 2024, which - left unfilled - would have detrimental consequences for our nation."
That’s why I am a cosponsor of the CHANCE in TECH Act.
Legislation like this aims to combat the skills gap crisis in the tech sector by fostering the creation of private-public partnerships and establish new apprenticeship programs that will give the generation of tomorrow the tools they need to bring the United States into the 21st century and beyond.
"Congressman Emmer hosting his annual Young Women Leadership Program at Metal Craft in Elk River, Minnesota."
Metal Craft is a facility that specializes in medical and surgical instrument manufacturing.
"I was also proud to vote for the American Manufacturing Leadership Act, which reauthorizes and extends the Manufacturing USA program at the Department of Commerce."
"This program is a public-private partnership between governments, universities and industry focused on manufacturing innovation and facilitating collaboration across federal agencies in implementing advanced manufacturing initiatives."
"Finally, I along with several of my colleagues sent a letter in support of the Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Program (IRAP) proposal - issued by the Department of Labor - which would help to expand apprenticeship programs in industries currently lacking training."
"Importantly, this program recognizes the value and preserves existing apprenticeship programs such as the ones in the construction and building trades."
"As a member of the Manufacturing Caucus, I am committed to ensuring that Congress is focused on manufacturing friendly policies."
"I have long supported and worked to expand technical education, such as apprenticeship programs in order to better align the next generation’s workforce with the industry."
"We must focus on workforce development and training of trades, which are so crucial to our future success."
"I am proud to support manufacturing day in our country, but I want to make it clear that in Minnesota every day is Manufacturing Day!"
"Sincerely,    TONIGHT:  Please join me at my town hall in Blaine tonight."
"We will begin at 7:00PM at the Blaine City Hall located at 10801 Town Square Dr NE, Blaine, MN 55449."
Call my district office if you have any questions at 763-241-6848.
I hope to see you there!

Impeachment: A Partisan Distraction I enjoy using this column to discuss important but less well-known issues that affect the lives of Southwest Virginians.
"As your representative in Washington, I work on policy matters that make a difference in our communities, such as economic development, health care, and rural broadband."
"These topics may not grab headlines, but they are vital, and I do my best to keep you up to date on developments."
"While traveling the Ninth District during the October district work period, I took part in events that offer valuable opportunities for our communities."
"Over the past several years, I have worked to secure federal funding for Virginia through the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Pilot Program, and on October 2 I helped announce two more projects to restore land for economic development purposes."
"The Dante Community Redevelopment Project in Russell County received $269,000 for developing trail networks and closing mine portals."
"The Dickenson County Public Service Authority received $356,500 for extending waterline to serve a campground."
Both grants will increase the regions appeal for tourism and promote job growth.
"On October 3, I visited Virginia Tech and learned more about the important research being done there."
"Some of it has the potential to reshape economic opportunities in rural areas, such as the ongoing development of space technology, which includes building satellites similar to those companies such as Amazon are developing to bring broadband to rural areas."
"Later that evening, I spoke at the New River Valley Rail 2020 Legislative Reception, an event to support the extension of passenger rail service further into Southwest Virginia."
Progress in all of these areas could tangibly benefit citizens of the Ninth District in their lives and deserve our attention and effort.
We have important work to do.
"But unfortunately, the House Democrat decision to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump threatens to absorb our attention and block progress on the things that matter."
"When I talk to constituents, I frequently hear their frustration about Democrats pursuing investigation after investigation after investigation into President Trump."
"To be clear, I support legitimate oversight of every administration."
It is a fundamental congressional responsibility.
"The Democrat approach to President Trump, however, has been to launch inquisitions that start by presuming the President guilty at the outset and rooting around for possible evidence of guilt afterward."
This impeachment inquiry is no different.
"Speaker Pelosi announced it on September 24, the day before the transcript of President Trumps supposedly-incriminating phone conversation with the President of Ukraine was made public."
I read that transcript and the whistleblower complaint from a member of the intelligence community that was later released.
"They did not contain anything which would justify the impeachment of the President of the United States, an action taken by the House of Representatives only twice in our history, or his removal, never done by the Senate."
"I might not have used the words President Trump used in his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but I did not find the substance inappropriate."
"If it was inappropriate, as most Democrats in the House think, then the question is: was it appropriate for former Vice President Joe Biden to brag about telling Ukrainian officials, Im leaving in six hours."
"If the prosecutor is not fired, youre not getting the money, referring to $1 billion in American loan guarantees?"
"Remember, that prosecutor was looking into the company his son worked with."
Three Democratic senators also would have a lot to answer for if President Trumps call with President Zelensky crossed a legal line.
"In May 2018, Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote to Ukraines Prosecutor General."
"They begin their letter noting how the United States has aided Ukraine, then shift to demanding that country cooperate with an investigation of President Trump, their political rival."
"Justice demands that if the President be held to a particular standard, these Democrat officials should be as well."
"Justice is not the aim of this impeachment inquiry, in my opinion."
"For the next several months, the attention of the House and of the nation will be focused on a political campaign against President Trump."
This is not healthy for our Republic.
It is still not too late for Democrats to drop the theatrics and start working on the real issues facing the American people.
"If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office."
"Dear Friend,  I remain frustrated with the circus-like atmosphere that continues to occupy Washington, D.C. and interfere with getting things done on the important issues that impact the lives of my constituents."
"However, I was glad to be back home last week for our October District Work Period."
"It allowed me the opportunity to meet with many constituents and attend events in our community, which is my favorite part of the job."
"Additionally, I am continuing to work behind the scenes with my colleagues in both parties to advance policies that will improve the lives of Americans."
Continue reading for a brief recap of my work on your behalf last week.
"Growing the Economy  The September Jobs Report released last week shows that 136,000 more jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month and the national unemployment rate fell to a new 50 year low, at 3.5%."
We must continue to focus on creating an environment where innovation can thrive and growth can occur.
Friday was National Manufacturing Day.
Manufacturing jobs are vital to the U.S. economy.
"In honor of this important day, my team participated in the Upper Tampa Bay Chamber of Commerce's annual Manufacturing Day Dinner."
The theme of the dinner was “Develop Your Talent Pipeline.” Access to skilled labor is critical to the success of manufacturing and other high tech sectors.
This theme recognizes the ongoing work of the Tampa Bay Partnership in employing a nationally validated model to assist in raising the bar for the manufacturing and healthcare sectors.
I appreciate the meaningful work of this dedicated group and will continue to support their efforts.
"Additionally, my team participated in a Manufacturing Day event at Leggett & Platt, a successful manufacturing firm in my district."
This company opens its doors every year for high school students to come in and learn about the manufacturing industry.
Providing this type of hands-on learning opportunity helps to develop the talent pipeline that is needed within the industry.
Protecting Seniors by Strengthening Medicare  I was pleased to participate in the signing of last week’s Executive Order on Medicare.
"I’m glad to see this Administration introduce more choice and price-lowering competition in Medicare Advantage, address the provider shortage by aligning provider scope of practice with state law, streamline the coverage determination process to expedite access to new technologies and improve transparency and program integrity measures to better combat fraud, waste, and abuse."
Last Congress a broad reform package addressing the nation's opioid crisis was signed into law.
I authored several provisions of the law including one which created a drug management program – also known as a lock-in program – to prevent physician shopping and pharmacy shopping within the Medicare program.
It’s time to put patients over politics.
We must work together to strengthen and improve Medicare for our seniors and future enrollees.
"Improving the Care for Our Heroes  The VA MISSION Act, streamlined VA's duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program."
"The recently released VFW “Our Care” report includes data from nearly 7,000 Veterans."
The responses from these Veterans indicate that the MISSION Act is delivering on its promises.
I look forward to continuing to build upon this success to ensure all Veterans receive the care they deserve.
"As noted in this article, it is shameful that the House recently passed legislation that would give illegal immigrants access to electronic health records years ahead of the schedule we have funded to provide this level of care to Veterans."
"I voted against the bill, and also supported an amendment that would have prioritized funding for e-medical records for Veterans, but the amendment failed."
My hope is that common sense will prevail in the Senate.
Protecting Consumers   Millions of Americans continue to die from opioid overdoses.
Safeguards are critical to ensuring best prescribing practices.
I applaud the FDA for cracking down on the illegal sale of opioids online.
Click here to see me questioning Mark Zuckerberg about this very issue.
I’m glad to see the FDA is finally taking this concern seriously.
Promoting Public Health  This story reveals troubling information about Florida’s low rates of vaccination.
Vaccines are vital to ensuring public health and safety.
"They save lives, which is why I co-authored the VACCINES Act (H.R."
2862) earlier this year.
"This bipartisan bill will help increase immunization rates across the country and prevent future outbreaks of contagious, deadly diseases."
"Additionally, part of promoting public health is having systems in place that help keep violent criminals off the street."
"Instead of wasting time grandstanding on politically motivated games during our last week in DC before the October District Work Period, House Leadership should have accepted our attempt to vote on S. 820, the Debbie Smith Act, which provides necessary funding to address the national rape kit backlog."
"The annual funding, which was reauthorized in 2008 and 2014, expired last week."
The funding it provides for DNA testing is critical to proving crimes of a sexual nature and vital to getting predators off our streets.
"These are the type of tangible problems that need our attention, and we should have bipartisan support to get it done rather than engaging in petty partisanship."
"My hope is that when we return to DC, my colleagues will join me in expediting passage of this crucial legislation."
Learning from You  I enjoyed meeting with constituents and providing a legislative update at Heritage Pines last week.
"I received helpful feedback from many of them regarding the VA, the need to protect Medicare and the direction of our country."
I assured them that I will continue to focus on their priorities and work to get things done.
Raising Awareness  Domestic Violence is a significant public health issue that has considerable societal costs.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 1/5 women and 1/7 men have been victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives.
"Additionally, over 7 million American children live in a home in which domestic violence has occurred."
There is help available and hope for a life free of violence.
"If you or someone you know suffers from some form of domestic violence, please call the national help line."
October is also Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
We must continue to invest in the critical research that holds the promise for a cure.
I was proud that Team Bilirakis was able to participate in a recent event to help raise awareness and funds to support local breast cancer fighters.
"Additionally, starting 10/1/20, every air traveler (domestic and international) will need to provide a REAL ID-compliant card or passport to travel."
They will no longer be able to use their driver’s license as a form of ID unless it’s REAL ID-compliant.
It is important to plan in advance to avoid delays.

"Constituent Corner  Last week, I received the following note from a constituent in Safety Harbor."
“I just want to thank you and your entire team.
I know that without your intervention my request to expedite review of my wife’s Visa application would not have happened.
You have no idea how much your efforts mean to our family.”  This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends meetings, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team enjoyed participating in two Habitat for Humanity dedications in Dade City last week.
The stories of these two families on their journey to receive their forever homes were inspirational!
Congratulations and best wishes!
"My team was excited to attend last week's Zephyrhills Chamber of Commerce breakfast and listen to Dr. Torres, Medical Director of Advent Health, who spoke about hospital scoring systems."
These tools help us measure patient outcomes and ensure quality care.
"My team was proud to be a part of the Grand Opening of Healthy & Fresco, a new Veteran-owned small business in Land O Lakes."
We appreciate your service to our nation and welcome you to our community!
My team was also excited to participate in the City of Dunedin's Legislative Priorities Workshop.
I look forward to working alongside these local leaders to secure positive results for our mutual constituents.
"Hello, Friends— As we enter the second week of the “formal” impeachment inquiry into President Trump, one thing is clear: nothing has changed."
"Democrats are still grasping at straws, now basing their impeachment efforts on — what else?"
"— “collusion,” this time with Ukraine."
Last time it was Russia.
Now it’s Russia’s next-door neighbor.
"The Democrats leading this charade are being hypocritical — especially Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who blatantly  quotes from President Trump’s phone call with the President of Ukraine."
Is this what we’ve come to?
Mr. Schiff is obsessed with finding “dirt” on the President.
But remember when he was caught on tape trying to solicit salacious information from “Ukrainian politicians” (who actually turned out to be Russian prankster radio hosts) about President Trump?
Watch it below:         Click to Play!
"If you’re following along at home with the Democrats’ game of “pin the tail on the impeachment theory,” they’ve gone from collusion, to obstruction of justice, to emoluments, and now to a whistleblower on President Trump’s Ukraine."
"You wouldn’t be able to get the so-called evidence from this whistleblower admitted into a court of law, so how do the Democrats expected to use it as a basis to impeach a president?"
"I’ve spent this week back home in Florida, and it is clear to me that the American people are NOT convinced by any of the Democrats’ arguments."
(I think it’s telling that Democrats announced their ‘impeachment inquiry’ and then immediately followed it up with a Congressional recess).
"On Tuesday, I went on Fox Business to talk with Lou Dobbs about the Democrats’ hypocrisy."

"My friend and colleague, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) has introduced a bill to  the actions of House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, which I have cosponsored."
"Mr. Schiff has abused his position as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and has betrayed the trust of the American people."
"His “,” to quote Rep. Devin Nunes, has gone on long enough."
"The Klopfer Tragedy Last month, 2,246 preserved human fetal remains were found on the property of the home of Abortionist Ulrich ‘George’ Klopfer."
"Before he died, Mr. Klopfer committed truly heinous acts during his time as a doctor in Northern Indiana."

"As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the B Reactor, we recognized an important accomplishment for the people of the greater Columbia Basin: the final removal of the radioactive sludge in the K Basin near the Columbia River."
"As we move forward in tackling the many more goals and milestones needing achieved at Hanford, I am grateful for the hard work of the Hanford workforce and the support of Secretary Perry."

"Improving Fish Passage   I joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and scientists from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to tour the new high-tech turbine at Ice Harbor Dam, which was designed to increase power productivity and improve safety for fish passing through the dam."
"PNNL deployed their groundbreaking Sensor Fish technology, which mimics a fish's pathway and movement through the dam system, so scientists can better understand how they can continue to improve our world-class fish passage."
"We are lucky to have some of the greatest scientific minds located in Central Washington, who are working to ensure we can responsibly maintain our hydropower dams, iconic Washington salmon species, and our way of life."
National Manufacturing Week   I joined the Association of Washington Business on part of their Manufacturing Week tour to visit Bogert Manufacturing in Pasco.
"I learned about Safe Jack, a line of jacks for cars and trucks with varying capacity, and all of their operations in Central Washington."
Bogert Manufacturing was named 2019 Innovator of the Year by Seattle Magazine and has received AWB's Manufacturer of the Year award.
"Washington state has a thriving manufacturing industry, and it was great to see how companies like the Bogert Group are contributing to our local economy."
100 Years of Ag Research & Innovation   Washington State University's Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center celebrated 100 years of agriculture research and innovation.
"I joined faculty, staff, and students to celebrate this milestone at the Center in Prosser."
"For an entire century, scientists and researchers at the Prosser IAREC have been helping farmers in Central and Eastern Washington produce many of the crops we are proud of today, and their research continues."
"Wine grapes, hops, soil sciences, pest and disease management, and precision agriculture are only some of the topics WSU faculty and students are tackling to improve agriculture throughout the Columbia Basin and beyond."
Here's to another 100 years!
"Rest in Peace, Assistant Chief Johnson Assistant Chief Christian Johnson, a volunteer firefighter from Okanogan County Fire District 3, was badly injured fighting the Spring Coulee Fire earlier this summer."
"Sadly, he passed away this week at Harborview."
Assistant Chief Johnson was an Army veteran who has served as a volunteer firefighter for the past 20 years.
News from Representative Lowenthal                           HOW CAN ALAN HELP?
LEGISLATION 47TH DISTRICT ABOUT ALAN CONTACT ALAN                  In This Edition  The president’s attempt to coerce a foreign government to interfere in our 2020 election led to the start of an impeachment inquiry in the House.
I sent a letter to the Mexican Government on the fifth anniversary of the disappearance of 43 students in Ayotzinapa.
"Despite the wave of headlines coming out of Washington this week, the House continued to work on many critical issues unrelated to impeachment."
"Last week, I was honored to join Billie Jean King for the opening of the new Long Beach main library named after her."
"This week in the Inbox, I share my response to constituents who contacted me with concerns about facial recognition software."
"If you have ever wanted to obtain an American flag that has flown over the U.S. Capitol, read Congress U this week to learn how."
"Lastly, don’t forget to look at last week’s poll results, and make sure you take this week’s poll in the right-hand column."
CONNECT WITH ME                    Do you support impeachment proceedings against President Trump over his attempt to pressure a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election?
"Yes   No   Maybe   Don't know/Unsure    If you have a problem, click here to open survey in a new window                   The Start Of An Impeachment Inquiry  A federal government whistleblower has detailed actions taken by President Trump and the White House, that if proven true, call for the impeachment of the president."
"What the  to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson () was that President Trump's attempt to coerce the government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election was so egregious that White House officials who listened in on President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky were ""deeply disturbed,"" and, feared they had ""witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain."""
This led to an attempt by White House officials to cover up the call by confiscating and securing printed and electronic copies of the written summary.
"In just under 10 pages it describes not only the president's illegal acts, but the details of the attempted cover-up, as well as the broader actions taken by the president, above and beyond the phone call, to coerce Ukraine to manufacture politically damaging material on Vice President Biden."
This is exactly why the House had no choice but to start the impeachment process.
"For years, the president has careened from shameful actions to inhumane policies to outright disregard for the rule of law."
He has continually put his self-interest and profits above his duty to both the Constitution and the American people.
The president’s attempts to influence the 2020 election through a foreign government--and the lies and obfuscation that surround it—yet again crosses the line both constitutionally and legally.
I intend to vote for articles of impeachment that detail President Trump’s high crimes and misdemeanors.

It is time to hold this president accountable.
"Anniversary Of 43 Disappeared Students In Mexico  This week, I marked the fifth anniversary of the forced disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa, Guerrero, Mexico by leading a Congressional letter to the Mexican government offering support for recent efforts by the new Mexican administration to bring truth and justice to the families."
"At the same time, I also raised strong concerns about the ongoing failure to secure convictions in the case and urged further progress in the face of investigative setbacks."
"In September 2014, 43 Mexican student teachers from Ayotzinapa, Mexico, disappeared while traveling to Mexico City."
"To date, the remains of only one of the students has been positively identified."
"In the past five years, at least 80 suspects have been arrested, though no one has yet been tried or convicted."
"Questioning Interior Department Solicitor  Despite the swirl of headlines out of Washington, D.C. this week, it is important to remember that the regular business of the House, including work on many critical issues, continues."
My colleagues and I on the Natural Resources Committee remain focused on protecting our environment and addressing climate change.
"This week, we passed legislation that would help coastal communities design and implement climate-resilient living shorelines."
"Further, we reauthorized the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, important bipartisan legislation to protect and restore wetlands and their habitat."
I also took the Trump Administration directly to task for overturning Obama Administration cancellations of mining leases next to the Boundary Waters Wilderness in Minnesota.
"During testimony before our committee, I pressed Solicitor Daniel Jorjani, of the U.S. Department of the Interior--an appointee of President Trump--on why these leases were renewed."
"I also asked him if these renewals had anything to do with his three earlier meetings with the lease owner, who just happens to be Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s landlord here in DC."

"Honoring Long Beach Native Billie Jean King Last week, I had the pleasure of joining Long Beach’s own Billie Jean King to dedicate our new Billie Jean King Main Library at the just-opened Long Beach Civic Center."
It was such a pleasure to share a few moments with her and to join in the celebration as our city honored her inspiring legacy and continuing contributions.
"The word icon is simply too small to capture the enormous impact she has had on not just tennis, not just on the United States, but on the world."
"She is a pioneer in athletics, a trailblazer in the fight for equality, a role model for women and the LGBT community, and an inspiration to every American."
She has not only earned this honor--she deserves it for the ground she has broken and the paths that she has set.
"Also in recognition of her contributions, I joined with then-Congressman Joe Crowley in the last Congress to introduce the Billie Jean King Congressional Gold Medal Act."
The Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the highest civilian awards in the United States.
"Unfortunately, the legislation was not moved out of committee by the GOP committee leadership."
"I plan on introducing the legislation again during this Congress, and now with a Democratic majority in the House, I feel confident we can move the bill toward passage."
"My office receives hundreds of letters, emails, and calls each week from constituents wanting to share their views and concerns on a variety of topics."
"Recently, I have received many messages from constituents on the topic of facial recognition software."
Below is my response to those messages: “Facial recognition software is a technological innovation that has made its way into our daily lives.
The technology recognizes our facial features and scans existing photo and video databases to find a match.
"Although the technology has the potential to aid in security and policing interests, privacy organizations are worried facial recognition could seriously threaten the digital privacy of everyday Americans."
I share your concerns and have always fought to protect my constituents’ digital privacy.
There is no question that electronic surveillance powers for our intelligence community have helped keep Americans safe.
"However, these authorities must also protect the fundamental right to a reasonable expectation of privacy for every American citizen and uphold the protections granted by the Fourth Amendment which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures."
"Like you, I believe that Americans’ privacy should be protected in the same way that your physical property is."
"However, our policies have not kept pace with modern telecommunications technology, and I believe that Congress must re-evaluate these programs to ensure that Americans’ privacy is protected."
"I am a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus’ Working Group on Surveillance, a group of members dedicated to privacy protection and surveillance reform."

Our current 50-star flag is the only version of the flag to have lasted more than 50 years without being changed.
"All told, there have been 27 official versions of the U.S. flag, most with a different amount of stars, but even a few with more than 13 stripes."
"US flag with 15 stars and 15 stripes flies over Fort McHenry, location of the bombardment during the War of 1812 that inspired the Star-Spangled Banner."
"Thanks to the Capitol Flag Program, members of the public can purchase new flags that have been flown over the Capitol."
Since 1937 the Architect of the Capitol has run the flag program allowing members of the public to purchase flags flown over the Capitol through their Representative’s or Senator’s offices.
The program was so successful that an official Flag Office was created in the 1950s.
"The Architect’s office fulfills all flag requests, flying the requested flags on special poles at the Capitol on every day of the year, weather permitting, excluding Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day."
"Since 1976, after it is flown over the U.S. Capitol, each flag is issued a keepsake Certificate of Authenticity by the Architect of the Capitol."
"Currently, the Architect of the Capitol fulfills more than 100,000 flag requests from Members of Congress annually, with the number of requests and the popularity of the Capitol Flag Program growing steadily each year."
"If you are interested in ordering a flag that has flown over the Capitol for a loved one or for a special occasion,         Should California be allowed to set their own auto emission standards above the federal levels?"
"Dear Friend,  This week in Washington was one of the most embarrassing in recent memory, as Democrats became a parody of themselves and passed the point of no return when Speaker Pelosi announced she would support an impeachment inquiry after fabricating a deceptive narrative over a phone call President Trump had with the Ukrainian President."
"Even without knowing the facts and before the transcript of the call was released, Speaker Pelosi irresponsibly, carelessly, and prematurely rushed to conclusions and alleged the President had committed “high crimes.”  This latest installment of the impeachment saga further exposes the Democrats blood lust for removing this President from office and nullifying the votes of 63 million Americans."
"By acquiescing to the demands of her far-left liberal base, Speaker Pelosi showed us that she is not serious about governing or passing bipartisan proposals like the USMCA or prescription drug pricing."
"While the die may be cast for the Democrats on impeachment, I know the American people will have little patience for this political posturing through endless investigation."

"Expanding Access to our Third Largest Ag Market While Democrats in Washington were wasting time on partisan, politically-charged impeachment, President Trump was in New York at the United Nations working hard on the people’s business and putting America first."
"Perhaps the most important action item to come out of the U.N. was the new trade deal President Trump announced with Japan, our third largest agriculture export, which will reduce or eliminate tariffs on over $7 billion of U.S. ag product."
"Opening up access to the Japanese market for our agriculture products is a big win for our farmers and ranchers as well as rural America, and doing more free and fair trade deals in the Asia Pacific region will also mitigate China’s unjustified tariffs and pressure them to stop their unfair practices."
"Along with the free market reforms we have been enacting at home, these America-first trade policies abroad will ensure the United States will remain the land of opportunity and unparalleled prosperity for the next generation."

"Obstructing the President’s Border Security Policies Even though defending our sovereign borders and protecting our citizens is the first and most important responsibility of the federal government, this week my colleagues in the House and Senate voted to end President Trump’s national emergency declaration that gives him the critical tools and latitude needed to do what House Democrats won't: secure our southern border."
"I have always maintained that the situation at our southern border is a crisis, and that the President has clear legal authority to declare a national emergency, just as previous presidents have done over 50 times before him."
"Unfortunately, this resolution is just the latest episode in Congressional abdication and Democrats’ endless obstruction of this President’s border security policies, which are already having a significant impact with a nearly 60% decline in illegal border crossings since May."
"While this vote is a step backward in protecting the sovereignty of our nation and keeping our communities safe, I am confident that, just as we saw last time, President Trump will have the support in Congress needed to sustain his veto."
Hearing Directly from my Fellow West Texans Thank you to everyone who participate in my telephone town hall this week.

Dear Friends-  The last legislative week of September was overshadowed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.
"This latest effort by lawmakers to remove President Trump from office undermines our ability to address the real challenges that face American families and businesses—challenges like the spiraling cost of healthcare, securing our border, and strengthening and growing our trade relationships with international partners."
Time spent on impeachment is time not spent on the things that have a real effect on the lives of Ohioans.
"I will continue to fight for things like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which should enjoy a bipartisan majority of support."
"Hopefully, Speaker Pelosi will bring it before the House so that we can pass it and reap the economic rewards of the agreement."
"SAFE Banking Act         Congressman Davidson discusses the SAFE Banking Act on the House floor       On a more positive note, we had a small, but important bipartisan victory in the House this week with passage of the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act (H.R.1595)."
Rep. Steve Stivers (OH) and I joined as lead cosponsors of this bill with Democrat Reps. Ed Perlmutter (CO) and Rep. Denny Heck (WA).
"Banks in the United States should never be told to whom they can and cannot offer their services, especially when it interferes with lawful commerce."
"In 2013, the Department of Justice launched an initiative known as Operation Choke Point, which aimed to investigate U.S. banks that did business with companies that were believed to be at higher risk for fraud and money laundering."
"By doing this, the Obama-era Justice Department investigated and pressured banks on who they should and should not bank."
Operation Choke Point harmed law-abiding firearms manufacturers and sellers.
No federal regulator should block Americans’ lawful access to the financial system.
"The SAFE Banking Act defends civil liberties, and I am hopeful that the Senate will be able to pass this bill."
This Week in Committee      It was also a busy week in the Financial Services Committee.
"Capital formation was a prominent theme, and we discussed ensuring equal opportunity to financial gain for small businesses and tech startups, which are critical for the future of American innovation."
"My bill, The Token Taxonomy Act, would create a clear regulatory framework for blockchain startups."
The Token Taxonomy Act would help to truly make America a land of opportunity for the new generation of businesses in the technology sector.

"This week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would pursue an “impeachment inquiry” into President Trump – but her announcement changed nothing."
Below is my full statement on her announcement.
"The Debbie Smith Act provides funding to help address the backlog of DNA evidence in criminal investigations, which is essential to secure convictions in rape and sexual assault cases."
"This law has a 15-year history of nearly unanimous support in Congress, under both Republican and Democratic majorities and presidents."
The funding expires in days.
I called on the House to immediately consider the bill to reauthorize the funding.
"On Wednesday, I joined Chris Berg on Point of View to discuss the impeachment announcement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), prescription drug pricing, and several other issues."
"The full video of our segment is below, and I encourage you to watch our full conversation."
"President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to a new trade deal that will open new markets for $7 billion in U.S. agricultural products, including wheat."

"Statement on Speaker Pelosi’s Announcement  Speaker Pelosi’s statement makes a good headline, but it changes nothing."
Formal impeachment can only start after receiving 218 votes on the floor of the U.S. house.
"Instead of working to pass USMCA, fix our broken immigration system, and reduce drug prices, House Democrats continue to delegitimize a duly elected President and pass partisan bills that have no chance of becoming law."
The Debbie Smith Act The Debbie Smith Act provides funding to examine DNA evidence in criminal investigations.
The funding is primarily used to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits.
It has a 15-year history of nearly unanimous support in Congress.
"So, why is it being used as a political bargaining chip this year?"
"Watch my speech on the House floor this week:     Point of View with Chris Berg On Wednesday, I joined Chris Berg on Point of View to discuss impeachment, the Debbie Smith Act, USMCA, and all of the developments out of Washington this week."
Watch the clip below:     New U.S.-Japanese Trade Agreement   A new trade agreement with Japan signed this week opens new markets for $7 billion in U.S. agricultural products.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Trump announced the deal this week at the United Nations.
"The agreement lowers or eliminates tariffs on a variety of agricultural products important to North Dakota, including beef, wheat, and potatoes."
"It also includes preferential market access through the creation of country-specific quotas, which provide access for a specified quantity of imports from the United States at a preferential tariff rate, generally zero."
"The United States and Japan also struck an agreement on digital trade that prohibits tariffs on digital products like videos, music, e-books, software, and games that are transmitted electronically."
"The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the digital provisions “meet the gold standard on digital trade rules set by the USMCA.” According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is “potentially the first step in a broader trade agreement between the two countries.” The agreement was praised by North Dakota Grain Growers Association and North Dakota Stockman’s Association."
"“Japan is a top importer of North Dakota wheat, so this deal could have a very positive impact on our markets,” said NDGGA President Jeff Mertz."
"“This new deal will give our domestic beef industry more leverage and a level playing field with our competitors so we can expand our market share in Japan,” said NDSA President Dan Rorvig."
Photos of the Week  Several North Dakota sheriffs were in DC this week for an event on border security.
"They stopped by my office, where we talked about fighting the opioid epidemic, criminal justice reform, securing the border, and immigration reform."

"News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window     Click here to open a plain text version of this email                        September 27, 2019  This week saw the explosive details of the whistleblower complaint regarding President Trump’s shakedown of the President of Ukraine in exchange for political dirt on his opponent made public and the investigation into that matter, and impeachment proceedings, took center stage as my Democratic colleagues and I work to get to the bottom of the criminal and corrupt actions of this President."
"That included the House and Senate passing a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the whistleblower complaint regarding the President’s shakedown of the President of Ukraine in exchange for political dirt on one of his opponents should be immediately transmitted to the House and Senate intelligence committees, as required by law."
"My fellow House Intelligence Committee Members and I also questioned Acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire at length about his handling of the report, including his inexplicable decision to take the whistleblower’s credible, urgent, and good-faith complaint to the White House – the very entity that was the subject of the complaint – for their input on what he should do."
"DNI Maguire was unable to answer my questions about senior White House officials moving records of the call between President Trump and the President Zelenskyy into a system which is intended to hide our nation’s most secret information, not criminal behavior."
"Rest assured that my colleagues and I will reconvene next week – despite the September recess – for further investigation and to fulfil our sworn oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic… .” I was also proud to vote for a series of immigration bills to address the humanitarian crisis at our southern border and this Administration’s cruel and ineffective immigration policy."
I also voted to allow marijuana businesses operating legally in 47 states and the District of Columbia to have access to banking institutions.
"And this marked the second year that I have had the honor of hosting the release of the DEF CON Voting Village report, detailing election security vulnerabilities and failures."

Votes and Legislative Highlights Voted in favor of Resolution Expressing the Sense of Congress that the Whistleblower Complaint Should be Transmitted Immediately to the Intelligence Committees I was proud to join my colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee in voting for a resolution affirming that the whistleblower complaint should be shared with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.
"The resolution passed the House with 421 votes, with no Members voting against, and was supported unanimously in the Senate."
"Voted for Immigration Bills to Address the Humanitarian Crisis at Our Border This week, the House considered a series of immigration bills that would protect migrants in immigration facilities and end the President’s sham emergency declaration."
I was proud to vote for H.R.
"3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act, which would require Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to take seriously migrant health, and H.R."
"2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act, which would strengthen child protection policies and establish advisory and investigative bodies."
Recent reports of shameful conditions for women and children in border facilities highlight the urgency of passing legislation to ensure that migrants in the care of the U.S. are treated humanely.
The House also voted for the second time to end this President’s shameful attempt to circumvent congressional authority by declaring a national emergency to fund his vanity wall.
"Unfortunately, the President will likely veto this resolution a second time."
My colleagues and I will continue to fight the President’s reprehensible anti-immigrant policies.
"Passed Bill to Open Up Banking Services for Legitimate Marijuana Businesses This Wednesday, I voted for and the House-passed Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act."
"This legislation, which passed by a bipartisan vote of 321-103, would provide legal marijuana businesses with access to banking services, such as checking accounts and payment processing."
Federal law is way behind in responding to the legalization movement in many states.
"Today, 47 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use."
"California is the worldwide leader in this budding industry, with an anticipated $3 billion in legal sales this year."
"These businesses are operating legally at the state level, yet they have been barred from accessing the banking system and have had to resort to dealing entirely in cash, which is cumbersome and extremely insecure."
The SAFE Banking Act will help dispel the legal cloud hanging over these legitimate businesses and enable their continued growth.
Questioned Acting DNI on Handling of Explosive Whistleblower Complaint  Other Members of the Committee and I pressed Mr. Maguire on why he illegally held back from the congressional intelligence committees a grave and urgent whistleblower complaint detailing the President’s treacherous scheme.
"I also expressed my extreme concern to Mr. Maguire that he took this credible, urgent, and good-faith complaint first to the White House, the very entity that was the subject of the complaint, for their input on whether to share it with Congress, which is required by law."
"And DNI Maguire was unable to answer my questions about disturbing allegations that senior White House officials moved records of a call between Trump and the President of Ukraine into a system which is intended to hide our nation’s most secret information, not criminal behavior."
This attempted cover-up would have succeeded were it not for the bravery and dedication of the courageous whistleblower.
"The House Intelligence Committee is investigating these criminal and corrupt acts and has made this declassified, redacted complaint public."
"Spoke at Press Conference on PFAS Contamination in California On Thursday, I joined several of my colleagues in holding a press conference to highlight the Environmental Working Group’s blistering new report on PFAS contamination in California."
"According to the report, more than 7.5 million Californians are at risk of PFAS contamination through 74 impacted water systems in the state."
"Forty percent of these sites have, on at least one occasion, registered PFAS levels above the EPA’s lifetime health advisory of 70 parts per trillion."
"As the EWG report demonstrates, we’re facing a dire public health threat from the contamination of water, food, and air supplies by PFAS chemicals."
"The EPA set a nonbinding lifetime health advisory of 70 ppt for PFAS, but this threshold does not take into account multiple studies that show adverse health impacts at much lower levels."
Many states have drawn upon these studies to set limits that are seven times lower.
I’m deeply concerned that our regulatory agencies are failing to adequately protect the American people.
Congress cannot continue to be asleep at the switchboard.
"It must act swiftly to require health protective standards, regular monitoring of at-risk water sources, and filtration of PFAS-contaminated drinking water."
It must also ensure that entities such as the Department of Defense work with PFAS manufacturers to clean up contaminated ground water that impacts communities in the vicinity of contamination sites.
"The press conference highlighted PFAS provisions included in the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), including an amendment to classify PFAS as a “hazardous substance.” As we work toward a final NDAA, I will fight to retain these critical protections."
"Hosted Release of DEF CON Voting Village Report on Election Security On Wednesday, I once again hosted the DEF CON Voting Village at the Capitol as they debuted their report detailing the vulnerabilities discovered at this year’s annual hacking experiment of voting equipment used across America."
I was joined by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Congressman John Katko (R-NY) in expressing the urgency of this issue for all Americans and the importance of Congressional attention and action.
"The conference revealed numerous frightening vulnerabilities in our election security systems including:• Passwords for a model of touch-screen voting machines used in 27 states in 2018 could be discovered through a basic internet search.• A type of voting machine used in the 2018 election was running 15-year-old software with many known vulnerabilities.• Official election equipment, including a voter ID check-in machine with no Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)password, was hacked to display memes and video games instead of running elections.• An optical scanner used in 23 states in 2018 could be made to count additional votes after the close of the election."
So many have fought so hard for each of us to have a say in what kind of government we have.
We cannot afford to have that right stolen from us by invisible forces controlled by hostile foreign governments.
"Congress must do everything it can to prevent interference in our elections, including attempts to hack our voting systems and equipment."

"Met with the California Credit Union League On Wednesday, I met with representatives of the California Credit Union League."
"I have been a strong supporter of credit unions, most recently leading a letter in support of a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act that would prevent military installations from giving rent-free office space to for-profit banks."
"At the meeting, we discussed pressing issues affecting credit unions and their customers."
That includes lax data protection standards on retailers and payment processors that put customers’ personal information at risk and a disparity in the law that prohibits federal credit unions from offering long-term loan products that are easily available at state credit unions and for-profit banks.
Voices of California’s 14th District  Here are some issues raised this week: •191 constituents expressed support for the opening of an impeachment inquiry.
President Trump has tried time and time again to recruit foreign powers to meddle in our elections.
I support Speaker Pelosi’s decision to open an impeachment inquiry.
"In the United States, nobody is above the law and I am committed to following the facts and will do everything in my power to hold the President accountable for his corruption."
• 118 constituents shared their support for H.R.
"2245, the Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large Animal Trophies (CECIL) Act of 2019."
This bill would amend the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to treat species that are proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered to also be treated as such for trophy hunting purposes.
It would also require that any new wildlife imports to the U.S. enhance the conservation of the species.
"As a member of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, I believe we have a responsibility to safeguard our wildlife, preserve their habitats, and protect our public lands and I will support this bill if it reaches the House floor."
• 105 constituents expressed their support for H.R.
"230, the Ban Toxic Pesticides Act of 2019, which would ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos and prohibit any future registration of the pesticide."
Hi everyone - GREAT NEWS!
Our Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2019 passed the House and the Senate and is on its way to the President's desk to be signed into law!
We worked with Republican Representative Mike Bost to preserve critical programs that serve Veterans such as loans for low-income Veterans and transportation to vet centers for highly rural Veterans.
"Without action, these programs will expire at the end of the month."
Washington cannot play political games with Veterans’ care.
"UDDERLY RIDICULOUS: Flavored milk, like chocolate and strawberry, helps kids get vital nutrients including calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, but New York City is considering a plan to ban flavored milk from schools."
Studies show that reducing or eliminating the availability of flavored milk in schools has led to overall decreased milk consumption.
"For some families, the meals children receive in schools are their only source of recommended nutrients."
I joined local dairy farmers and elected officials to call on NYC to stop this misguided proposal.
I’m standing with Upstate farmers to tell NYC to MOOOOve it along and keep flavored milk in schools.
"IN CASE OF EMERGENCY: In rural communities, response time for ambulances and emergency services are crucial, because in life or death situations, every second counts."
"I was proud to announce funding for a new ambulance to serve Madison County, helping save lives and ensure care is there when it’s needed most."
I will never stop fighting for resources to ensure our rural communities have access to health care.
FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC: Our communities have been ripped apart by the opioid epidemic.
"Oswego County recently received a new designation from the Office of National Drug Control Policy, bringing much needed federal assistance to the brave local law enforcement working in the streets every day."
"Energy Production Means Energy Security On Saturday, September 14, explosions rocked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia."
"Attention quickly turned to Iran as the culprit behind the blasts, which cut Saudi oil production in half at the time."
Possible conflict between two of the Middle Easts major powers is a big news story.
"In another era, it would capture even more attention in the United States."
"Fortunately, technological innovation and smart energy policies have provided us with a measure of protection from these incidents."
Great strides in energy independence mean we are no longer so captive to events in the often-volatile Middle East.
"If you were alive in the 1970s, you likely recall the energy crises consumers faced here, caused in part by Middle Eastern politics and production challenges in the United States."
You may remember cars waiting in long lines for gasoline (I remember only being able to refuel my mothers car on certain days of the week based on my license plate number) or President Carter asking Americans to turn down their thermostats in winter.
"In 2011, as the nationwide average gas price hovered around $4 a gallon, President Obama said, We cant just drill our way out of the problem."
"Yet today, as AAA lists the national average gas price as $2.667 on September 23, we can see that domestic drilling did help solve the problem."
"Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration indicate that in 2018, the United States was the worlds leading oil producer at 17.87 million barrels a day, 18 percent of the worlds total."
Saudi Arabia followed with 12.42 million barrels per day and a 12 percent share of total world production.
We are not just powering our own country through oil production; we are powering the world.
"As a CNN article noted only two days before the attack on the Saudi oil facilities, the United States in June overtook Saudi Arabia and Russia as the worlds top oil exporter."
"Although Saudi Arabia reclaimed the top spot for the next two months, we are in contention."
Oil is far from our only asset in energy.
The United States hit a record high in natural gas production in 2018 and was a net exporter for the second year in a row.
"Before 2017, our country had not been a natural gas net exporter since 1957."
"Because America did not follow Democrats down that path and instead focused on developing domestic sources of energy, we are much more secure from the shocks of the worldwide energy market."
Good energy policy also requires us not to rest on our laurels.
Research and development allow us to find new potential sources of energy as well as get more out of the energy resources we already use.
Allowing domestic energy production to flourish and devoting resources to research have important implications in Virginias Ninth Congressional District as well as nationally.
All of the above energy policies supporting production mean the Federal Government does not smother coal under blankets of regulation.
We saw the consequences of this during the Obama Administration.
"In contrast, I have championed, and the Trump Administration has implemented, the lifting of burdensome regulations from coal production."
"Although low natural gas prices have hindered coals resurgence, it remains a source of energy both domestically and internationally."
I have also supported domestic energy in the Ninth District through legislative efforts to streamline and accelerate licensing for hydroelectric projects and federal funding through the Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Program to build solar installations.
"Research and development, including exciting projects at Virginia Tech, allow us to use more of what we already have in Southwest Virginia."
"For example, it has the potential to find new uses for coal."
"I believe that without the right energy policies, the shock to the U.S. energy market of the attacks in Saudi Arabia would have been much more severe, with serious consequences for our national security as well as consumer pocketbooks."
Democrats in Congress nevertheless advocate policies that would restore hurdles to domestic energy production.
Their Green New Deal would entirely suppress many of the energy sources that have propelled America to energy dominance.
The benefits of the energy self-sufficiency we enjoy today remind us why we should reject such an approach.
Energy production in the United States has strengthened our security as well as our economy.
"If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office."
"Dear Lindsey,  From Our Nation's Capital Last week, Republican Whip Steve Scalise organized a hearing on the Born Alive Survivors Protection Act."
"This bill would make sure that any child who survives an abortion attempt is given life-saving care, not left to die."
"If you have not had a chance to watch this hearing, I urge you to take a few minutes and at least hear the testimony from our witnesses, including a retired OBGYN/former abortionist, an MD & Director of 50-bed neonatal ICU, and an RN who held a dying abortion survivor (this part starts about 13 minutes into the clip below)."
"It was very nice to see Adams County Commissioner Viki Purdy and Idaho County Commissioner Skip Brandt at the National Association of Counties meeting in Washington, D.C.     We had a beautiful sunset 9/11 as we took time to remember all of the lives lost and honor the heroes who jumped into action 18 years ago."
It was wonderful to see Bob and Carmelita Jones from the Veterans of Foreign Wars— thank you for your service!
Great news from President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Wheeler-- the intrusive WOTUS rule was repealed!
The Scleroderma Foundation visited to discuss ways to consolidate research to address Scleroderma more effectively and efficiently.
Thank you for taking the time to meet with our team.
Met with Owner Teresa Nelson of Home Helpers in Pocatello and CEO/President Lane Kofoed of Assisting Hands Home Care LLC in Middleton.
"Senior care is the second-largest franchise industry in Idaho, offering opportunities for people to own their own business and fueling economic growth in our communities."
Idaho's First District We recently had some fun testing out a drone at the Department of Interior's Office of Aviation Services in Boise.
The Congressional App Challenge is open to middle and high school students of all coding abilities and the last day to submit an app is November 1st.
"I’ve recruited local tech leaders and innovators to judge the competition, and the winners will be honored at the capitol."
"Congressman Bruce Westerman, Representing the 4th District of Arkansas Greetings!"
"I spend quite a bit of time driving across Arkansas, and I've seen the condition of rural roads in the district gradually worsen over recent years."
"Unsafe rural roads take away one's peace of mind when commuting to work, visiting family and friends or even driving to the grocery store."
"No one should have to worry about the safety of themselves or loved ones just because our roads are falling apart, especially when the road that is crumbling may be the only route to take."
That's why I introduced the *Rural Road Safety Act* with Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer (D-Iowa) on Monday.
This bipartisan bill would restore a funding program for rural roads that was taken away and used elsewhere - we want to give this money back to communities so they can make critical safety improvements.
"Modernizing infrastructure in the Fourth District of Arkansas and across the country is one of my top priorities, and I am glad to join Rep. Finkenauer in cosponsoring this bill."
You can read more about the *Rural Road Safety Act* here [link 1].
"The rest of this week was spent in committee hearings, meetings with constituents, a Capitol night tour and a celebrity face you might recognize."
I am excited to share more with you in the sections below.
"Until next week, Bruce Westerman Arkansas' Fourth District Both the Natural Resources Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hosted hearings this week."
"Dear Friend,  Annual Congressional App Challenge Is Underway!"
I am thrilled to announce that the annual Congressional App Challenge for Virginia's Third Congressional District is underway again.
The challenge is open to all middle and high school students in Virginia's Third Congressional District.
The Congressional App Challenge is a competition aimed at encouraging U.S. middle and high school students to learn how to code by creating their own applications.
"The Challenge is intended to highlight the value of computer science and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education and encourage students to engage in these fields."
"This nationwide event allows middle and high school students from across the country to compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or ""app,"" for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice."
"By encouraging and recognizing our nation’s young programming talent, Congress hopes to shine a light on the growing importance of these skills."
"The Challenge submission deadline is November 1, 2019."
The 2019 Congressional App Challenge (CAC) is open to all middle and high school students who live or are eligible to attend middle or high school in the 3rd Congressional District of Virginia.
"Students who do not reside or attend a middle or high school in the 3rd Congressional District of Virginia can see if their Representative is participating by visiting: > All entries must be an original in concept, design and execution."
"Students may compete as individuals or in teams of up to four students, as long as two of the team reside in or are eligible to attend public high school in their congressional district."
No prior computer science coursework is necessary.
"All eligible middle and high school students are encouraged to participate, regardless of past experience!"
Students should register here.
"Official guidelines and submission instructions can be accessed by visiting:  >  If you have any additional questions, please call my District Office at (757) 380-1000."

Advances in both our electronic devices and the programs/apps that run on them provide ever-expanding communication possibilities and also potential dangers.
"As a select number of big tech firms control an increasing amount of these platforms, they have become the gatekeepers to the information we consume."
For decades we have had regulatory policies in place addressing the ownership and broadcasts of television and radio communications.
"Americans have a personal responsibility to fully understand the information they share and receive, and understand the context of those exchanges."
"However, I also believe it is critical that we have safeguards in place to protect the public from both intended and unintended bias by big tech companies."
"In a Senate hearing earlier this year, a psychology professor highlighted the potential risk to the integrity of our elections if we allow big tech to operate without proper oversight."
"#NoEnergyWeek    Last week, House Democrats celebrated #NoEnergyWeek by passing bills that will shut down domestic energy production in regions across the United States."
These policies will result in:   Reduced American energy production Higher costs for families and businesses Fewer jobs Greater dependence on energy from foreign nations with poor environmental and humanitarian standards Lost energy production royalty revenues for states and the federal government  Riverside County commuters spend a great deal of their time and money driving to and from work.
Higher gas prices reduce the amount of money families have to spend on other items in their budgets.
"I voted against these misguided bills and will continue to fight for energy policies that help, not hurt, Riverside County families."

"Dear Friends,  Congress is back in session, and Democrats wasted no time jumping straight into another week focused on attacking this president."
"Last Thursday, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee held a markup to consider procedures for conducting an impeachment proceeding."
"The problem is, Democrats can’t seem to decide whether they are in fact pursuing impeachment."
The ambiguity is nothing more than a product of my Democrat colleagues’ own making.
There’s an easy way to figure out exactly whether the House Judiciary Committee is in impeachment proceedings: It’s called a vote—a vote of the full House of Representatives.
"Until there is a vote on the House floor, Congress is not pursuing impeachment—no matter what you may hear from the Democratic majority."
I joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business last week to discuss why Democrats should stop wasting time on desperate investigations and start working on issues affecting every day Americans.
"Click here or on the image above to watch   Protecting Our Second Amendment Rights Last week, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee passed three bills to strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights—none of which would have prevented the mass shootings devastating our country."
"These bills are dangerous not only because they punish responsible gun owners, but because Democrats are offering people a false sense of security."
"As I’ve said many times, what makes you feel good doesn’t always heal you."
The worst thing we can do for people who are grieving or scared is to give them false hope.
"Back in February, I introduced the Mass Violence Prevention (MVP) Act to prevent firearm violence while protecting our Second Amendment rights."
This bill would have addressed factors in recent mass shootings by giving law enforcement the resources they need to respond to potential violence before it happens.
"It would also help prevent criminals from getting their hands on guns by increasing penalties for burglary of federal firearms licensees, therefore curbing the supply of guns going into the black market."
"For seven months now, the MVP Act has been on the Democrats’ desk, but they refuse to bring it to the Committee for a vote."
"To watch my remarks at the House Judiciary Committee’s markup last week, click here or on the image below."
"Competition in the Tech Sector Earlier this year, the House Judiciary Committee opened a bipartisan investigation into the relationship between big tech and market competition."
"On Friday, we issued formal document requests and other requests for information from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet Inc., and Facebook about their business practices."
"This information is key to determining whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues, and whether we need to modernize our antitrust laws in order to better promote competition in the tech sector."
"Our reasons for making these requests aren’t the same for each company, and our concerns with each company’s practices also vary in scale."
"Dear Friend, My number one goal as your representative is to empower Northeast Ohio’s economy, bring jobs to our area and make our region a destination for young families and small businesses."
Part of achieving that is ensuring that we are promoting our strengths as a community to industries that are expanding and looking for new locations to call home.
Last week I took a group of business and university leaders from our area out to Silicon Valley to do just that.
"Together, we met with venture capitalists, startups and leaders in the technology and cryptocurrency fields to promote the strengths of Northeast Ohio and make our case for why they should look to us as they make decisions on where to expand their businesses."
Northeast Ohio has everything we need to thrive in the innovation economy and software space.
"We have incredible universities training our students for the jobs of the future, we have good infrastructure and low housing costs, and we have advantages no one else has in the strength of our manufacturing and health care industries."
But these jobs won’t just appear – we have to go out and get them.
I look forward to continuing to work with business and industry leaders here in Northeast Ohio to make our case to the country and the world.

"Thank you to World War II Veteran Richard Masin This week I released another #TVT, or Thank-a-Vet Thursday video featuring U.S. Navy Veteran Richard Masin who served in the South Pacific during World War II."
The video is part of a longer interview that will be preserved in American history as part of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project.
Richard enlisted in the Navy after graduating from high school at age 17 and served three years of active duty from 1943 – 1946.
"During his time in the Navy, Richard earned his shellback crossing the equator on December 24, 1943 as part of the crew for the USS Alnitah, a cargo ship that transported troops and supplies throughout the Pacific theater from January 1944 to late July 1945."
"For his service, Richard was awarded the Asiatic Pacific Medal, American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and Navy Good Conduct Medal."
Listen to Richard’s story here.
Bringing a piece of the NFL to the financial services industry On Tuesday I had the privilege of speaking on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in support of H.R.
"281, the Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act of 2019 introduced by fellow Ohioan Rep. Joyce Beatty."
"This bill, also known as the Beatty Rule, seeks to capture the success of the Rooney Rule in the NFL and implement a similar rule for Regional Federal Reserve Banks when interviewing for a new president."
"By providing the opportunity to be interviewed and showcase their individual talents, this legislation will open more doors for individuals from a diverse background while still being based on merit."
"As a former NFL player, I consider myself a direct beneficiary of the Rooney Rule."
"Over my five seasons, I was blessed with the opportunity to be coached by two African American men who I consider to be some of the greatest leaders I have ever encountered."
"From 1921-2003, professional football had 7 minority head coaches."
"Once the Rooney Rule was instituted, the NFL has seen 18 minority head coaches."
I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues on this important issue and thank and congratulate Ms. Beatty for her work on this legislation.

"      --> -->         A Message From Congressman Peter DeFazio    Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email                       Update from Congressman Peter DeFazio  Dear Friends,  I had an enjoyable summer, traveling the Fourth Congressional District and meeting with many of you to discuss issues of great importance to the community."
Here’s an update on my visits throughout Southwest Oregon in August.
"Transportation, Jobs, and the Economy on the South Coast  I held a number of town hall meetings and took several tours on the south coast focused on infrastructure."
"I’m happy to report that the projects I’ve helped secure funding for are moving forward quickly, including the $6.5 million rehabilitation of Port Orford’s failed breakwater and more than $10.2 million in projects at Southwest Oregon Regional Airport."
"In addition, the harbors in Brookings, Coos Bay, Bandon, Gold Beach, Florence, and Reedsport are being dredged thanks to funding I helped secure from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)."
Congressman DeFazio touring the Port Orford breakwater rehabilitation project.
"At the town hall meetings I brought together regional leaders from the U.S. Coast Guard, the Corps, and the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to discuss needs and investments planned on the Southern Coast."
Coast Guard Sector North Bend Commander Olav Saboe thanked the community for their support of Coasties during the government shutdown.
"Oregon has more than 1,200 Coast Guard active duty, reservists, and civilian employees, all of whom went unpaid during the government shutdown, which lasted for 35 days."
The Coast Guard was the only branch of the armed services that wasn’t paid during the shutdown.
"That’s why I introduced and passed out of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which I chair, H.R."
"367, the Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act of 2019."
"This bill ensures that in the event of a lapse of appropriations, Coast Guard service members and employees will continue receiving their paychecks if the rest of the military is paid."
Portland District Commander Colonel Aaron Dorf focused on the role the Corps plays in dredging our ports and harbors and maintaining the jetties that protect them.
We discussed shoaling issues along the Rogue River and the need for consistent dredging at area ports.
"This fall, I expect the House to vote on my bill, H.R."
"2440, the Unlocking the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act of 2019."
This legislation will help ensure Congress spends revenues collected by the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund on their intended purposes: maintaining our ports and harbors.
"Frank Reading, ODOT’s Southern Oregon Region Manager, discussed the projects ODOT is working on in Southwest Oregon including the urgent repairs following the Hooskanaden slide."
"I have worked with ODOT to secure federal funding to repair the slide immediately while ODOT studies the costs and challenges of a new bridge, re-routing the highway, and improving the existing detour route."
"Back in Washington, I remain laser-focused on improving our infrastructure."
"In addition to the legislation I mentioned above, I am working on a surface transportation reauthorization to bring our roads, bridges, and transit systems up to a state of good repair and stop the self-defeating cycle of underinvestment that has been in place for the past 20 years."
"Renewable Hydrogen: A Tool to Reduce Carbon Emissions  In early August I held a roundtable to raise awareness of the potential for renewable hydrogen to power parts of our transportation system, maximize the efficiency of renewable energy production, and make our communities more resilient during natural disasters, all while significantly lowering carbon emissions."
"I brought together utilities, a major car manufacturer, energy entrepreneurs, and nonprofits dedicated to fighting climate change through substantive policy."
Congressman DeFazio hosting a roundtable focused on integrating renewable hydrogen with wind and solar to power vehicles and utilities.
"Hydrogen is a clean fuel that can power cars, buses, trains, ships, and even electric utilities while only emitting water vapor as a byproduct."
"To produce this hydrogen, electricity is used to split or “crack” water into hydrogen and oxygen."
"When that electricity comes from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, then we have a revolutionary fuel that could potentially meet significant amounts of energy needs without any carbon emissions."
"The Pacific Northwest has abundant solar and wind power generation, but there are times when the sun doesn’t shine, and the wind doesn’t blow."
Storing renewably-generated electricity is crucial to getting our country on a path to a 100 percent renewable energy future.
"By using renewable electricity to convert water in to hydrogen, we can store hydrogen fuel in fuel cells that can generate power when we need it."
An increasing number of utilities and companies are incorporating hydrogen fuel into their portfolios and long-term business plans.
"At the roundtable, Toyota brought its hydrogen fuel cell-powered Mirai passenger car."
Tech start-up Hydrostar brought a demonstration of a low cost electrolyzer that can use renewable energy to create 100 percent renewable hydrogen.
The Eugene Water and Electric Board is looking at innovative plans to use hydrogen to store surplus renewable energy as emergency backup power during natural disasters.
California is nurturing the use of hydrogen fuel-powered vehicles by co-funding hydrogen refueling stations.
"There are now more than 30 hydrogen fueling stations powering the more than 4,200 hydrogen fuel cars in the state."
"The federal government must play a role in propelling the growth of hydrogen fuel technologies, which have already proven its benefits."
"Like wind and solar, the federal government can provide various tools to help this technology reach economies of scale, reduce its price, and make it more available to the public."
"As Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am working to create a 21st Century transportation bill where renewable energy, including hydrogen, will play a major role."
"Dear Lindsey,  A lot has happened during August recess and I wanted to update you on everything that has been going on in the 39th District."
"As I continue to work hard as your Representative, it would be helpful to get your input on the issues that affect you the most."
"Whether that is through holding town halls, meeting with community groups, or speaking with you directly - the best way I can serve you is by hearing from you."
I encourage you to stay engaged and up to date on upcoming events by signing up for my newsletter here and sharing this email with your friends and family.
"Also, stay in touch by following me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, our handle is @RepGilCisneros."
I am humbled to serve you in Congress.

"Toured the La Habra Children's Museum La Habra Children's Museum has something for kids of all ages in the 39th District, from their STEAM Lab to their play park."
We had a great tour of their facilities and current exhibits geared toward hands-on learning.
Rep. Cisneros checking out the STEAM Lab and how it supports hands-on learning initiatives.
"Visited of Yamaha, Special Equipment Market Association (SEMA), and TAWA Supermarket I had a chance to tour the Yamaha Corporation of America facility and try out some of the instruments they provide for California and across the nation (picture below)."
We had a great discussion the economic impact of Yamaha's instruments in the U.S. economy.
"Yamaha also highlighted their advocacy for STEAM education in our district, ensuring the arts are prioritized at school."
It was a pleasure to tour SEMA in Diamond Bar to learn more about their programs and products that enhance Motorsports throughout the world.
Their organization not only supports our local economy in the 39th District but provides services to manufacturers and consumers to promote innovation in this industry.
Rep. Cisneros receiving a demo on innovative tools used to modify motor vehicles and discussing policies to support Motorsports.
I had a great visit and tour of 99 Ranch Market in Hacienda Heights.

I also had the opportunity to meet with members of the Orange County Business Council to learn more about the organization's efforts to support the 39th District's economy and entrepreneurs.
Rep. Cisneros speaking with OCBC about small business initiatives in Congress.
"Visited Businesses Made in the 39th   Rep. Cisneros taking a tour of Hydraflow’s warehouse to learn about their small business and defense projects (left) and receiving a demo of Stratvocate, which helps manufacturers gain insights on national security projects (right)."
I met with Strategy Advocates to learn about their online business intelligence tools aimed at supporting national security related projects.
"Then, I hosted a roundtable discussion at Hydraflow, which included other local aerospace manufacturers and supplier companies such as Pacmin, Ejay’s Machine, Aero Pacific, Aerofab Corporation, APV Manufacturing, Coast Aerospace, and AiReps."
"All these companies are promoting numerous technological innovations, from building cybersecurity software solutions to developing and manufacturing products for aerospace clients."
Each of our roundtable participants has a unique role in contributing to the economic health of our district.
We must continue to maintain a business and community environment that supports and attracts companies as well as creates more jobs for our constituents.
Rep. Cisneros receiving a presentation of Raytheon’s projects aiding our cybersecurity efforts (left) and presenting a certificate of recognition to Collins Aerospace in Brea recognizing their commitment to air travel safety (right).
"I also met with Raytheon to discuss their work related to defense, civil government, and cybersecurity solutions."
"Then, we toured Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation (UTC), to learn more about their key programs supporting our national defense and space operations."
"It was an honor to meet with Raytheon and United Technologies Corporation, who are both pushing the boundaries of aerospace research and development in the 39th District."
Dear Friend:  The House of Representatives just wrapped up its August district work period – that’s a time when the House is in recess so that Members of Congress can meet with their constituents to learn more about local concerns and let them know what’s been going on in Congress.
"I had a number of meetings in and around Pittsburgh over the district work period, and I wanted to share some of the highlights with you."
Neighborhood Night Out  I attended the Primary Care Health Services’ Patient Appreciation and National Night Out Celebration held at the Alma Illery Medical Center in Homewood.
"It gave me a chance to catch up with some constituents from Homewood and express my support for federally funded Community Health Centers, which provide health care services to all comers regardless of their ability to pay."
"The federal government currently provides roughly $5.5 billion a year to support the nation’s 10,000 Community Health Centers, which serve roughly 25 million people annually."
Most funding for Community Health Centers will expire if Congress doesn’t act to reauthorize it by September 30.
Saw Mill Run Creek  Flooding has long been an issue along Saw Mill Run.
"Several years ago, I worked successfully to have the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers address this flooding."
"That work improved the situation, but more still needs to be done to fix the problem."
"Many homes along Saw Mill Run Creek flooded last summer, and it’s only a matter of time before these properties are flooded and damaged again."
I wrote to President Trump last summer asking that he declare Pennsylvania a major disaster area due to the destructive floods and landslides we experienced.
Such a declaration releases federal assistance for the affected communities.
"Governor Wolf requested it as well, but our requests were denied."
"This August, I met with State Representative Dan Deasy, representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith, and other City of Pittsburgh officials to discuss options for preventing future flooding in the West End."
This meeting was successful in bringing all of the stakeholders together to come up with a plan for action.
"As a result of this meeting, the City removed a lot of debris from Saw Mill Run Creek in late August – and the City and the Army Corps of Engineers are looking at how to best move forward with long term efforts to prevent flooding along Saw Mill Run Creek."
"I will continue to press for Corps action on this flooding problem, and I am optimistic that we can reduce flood damage along Saw Mill Run Creek."
"Hawkins Village I led a tour of Hawkins Village with Michelle Kenney, Antwon Rose’s mother."
"I invited a number of local officials and representatives from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to see the neighborhood and discuss the concerns that the residents of the community have about issues like maintenance, public safety, and re-establishing a tenant council so residents would have greater input into management decisions."
Climate Change Town Hall  I believe that climate change is the most pressing issue facing our nation.
"If the United States and other big industrial countries around the world don’t reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the coming years, average global temperatures will rise significantly - with disastrous results."
I held a town hall meeting on Climate Change in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum in August to help raise public awareness about the issue.
"A panel of experts shared their knowledge about existing technologies that could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and around the world."
A second panel addressed the challenges of securing government action to promote the adoption of such environmentally sustainable energy technology.
"I followed up with a brief summary of Congressional action to address climate change, and the evening ended with those of us on stage answering questions from the audience."
I’ve been working with my Democratic colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to put together a bill that would result in no net U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050.
"We are currently holding a number of hearings on climate change-related issues, and we will continue work on the bill."
"AlphaLab  I also had the opportunity to visit AlphaLab, a Pittsburgh-based organization that helps people with interesting ideas for new products or services ""start up"" new businesses around their ideas."
"AlphaLab helps such start-ups develop business plans, find funding sources, work out legal issues, and get their businesses up and running."
"At AlphaLab, I met with a number of its clients in order to learn more about what goes on there – as well as the challenges their businesses are facing and what role the federal government can play in helping new businesses get off the ground."
"One of my top priorities in Congress is helping start-ups succeed and create good new jobs -- all across the country, of course, but especially in Pittsburgh!"
Our region is home to a number of companies that have taken some research done at local universities and built successful businesses around it.
Such start-ups are responsible for a lot of the economic revitalization Pittsburgh has experienced over the last 20 or 30 years.
"I have been a vocal, effective advocate throughout my service in Congress for increased investments in scientific and medical research, and I have been working with House Democrats on a range of policies to help entrepreneurs bridge the gap between the concept for a product and a company that's actually open for business."
"Wood Street Towers Apartments  I also had the opportunity over the district work period to meet with residents of Wood Street Towers Apartments, affordable senior housing in Wilkinsburg, to learn more about their needs and concerns, which fell primarily in the category of safety and security upgrades."
My staff is following up on some residents' requests for help dealing with federal government agencies.
"Any constituent who wants help dealing with federal programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, income taxes, student loans, passports and visas should feel free to contact my office online, by phone, or in person."
"Baldwin Health Center  I also visited with the residents and staff of the Baldwin Health Center, a nursing home where some people stay for a short time while recovering from surgery or an illness - and where others who are no longer able to live on their own receive long-term care."
"Most older Americans will need long-term care at some point in their life – and as the number of older Americans increases in the coming years, the need for long term care will grow dramatically."
"For example, the number of Americans over age 85 - the individuals most likely to require nursing home care - will triple to nearly 90 million in the coming years."
"Because most nursing home residents rely on Medicare for their health insurance and on Medicaid to cover their long-term care expenses, talking to them about their experiences and concerns helps me represent them better in Congress."
"I serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over both Medicare and Medicaid, so I am in a good position to promote legislation to improve those programs so that they better serve the tens of millions of Americans who depend upon them."
"New Century Careers  Finally, I visited New Century Careers, an education and training organization on the South Side for workers in Pittsburgh who want manufacturing jobs."
"With more and more Baby Boomers retiring every day, local manufacturers face massive shortages of skilled workers in the months and years ahead."
It's essential for our region's future economic growth that local companies can find workers with the skills they need - and many Pittsburghers need the job skills that will make a good-paying career possible in the years to come.
"Organizations like New Century Careers, which receives support from the Commonwealth, foundations, and local businesses, addresses both critical issues."
"It provides free training to students that prepares them for paid apprenticeships, and then it places them in local manufacturing companies."
"Given the rapid technological changes in manufacturing today, our nation needs to do more to provide Americans with skills that will be in demand in the coming decades."
"That's especially true for our region, where much of our recent economic growth has been driven by companies in high-tech fields like robotics, computers, and medicine."
Throughout my service in Congress I have been working to expand and improve Americans' opportunities to get the education and training they need for a rewarding career and a decent standard of living.
I'm glad that goal is shared by many individuals and organizations in our region.
"Congress is back in session  The district work period has now ended, and the House is back in session."
"Much of September will be dedicated to completing the legislation funding the federal government’s operations over the coming fiscal year, which begins on October 1."
I anticipate that many other issues will be addressed in the House this fall.
"If you would like to have real-time updates on my activities and meetings, please connect with me on social media."
"Dear Neighbor,  We had a very productive District Work Period talking to constituents in every corner of our community throughout August."
"I visited our local schools as students prepared for a new school year, toured local businesses and non-profits, met with many local advocacy groups, and most importantly spent time helping our community prepare for Hurricane Dorian."
Thank you for sharing your concerns and hopes with me.
Our face-to-face conversations help me learn how I can best represent you in Congress.
Today I return to Washington with a full agenda ahead.
"We face major decisions on lowering prescription drug prices, enacting gun safety legislation, tackling trade and budget debates, and even an impeachment inquiry."

"_______________   Friday's jobs report included more good news for hardworking Americans, small business owners and manufacturers."
Wages continue to rise and participation in the labor force has increased – meaning more people are working and pay is improving.
______________  Charitable organizations and churches serve a vital role in strengthening our communities and improving the lives of others.
"On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to visit with one of these entities - Citrus County Blessings – to chat with their volunteers and donate food for their after-school program."
"It was great to not only learn about their mission and how they serve, but also hear from the volunteers about issues they and the community are facing."
"_______________  Throughout my time in public service, I’ve helped create and support programs that serve and assist at-risk families and work to keep children safe."

"Jessie’s Place provides children and families with advocacy services and trauma-focused, evidence-based therapy to heal and mitigate trauma."
_______________  On Thursday I toured Cornerstone Hospice’s new Hospice House in The Villages.
This new Hospice House has 12 private beds for patients and their families.
"Once full renovations are complete next Spring, Cornerstone’s facility in The Villages will have 24 beds total."
Thank you for the great level of care you provide to those you serve.
_______________  I enjoyed touring the newest Public Safety Department and Customer Service Center in The Villages yesterday.

"It will also serve as a satellite government service center where residents can get information on utility and amenity bills, acquire resident ID cards and sign up for community watch programs."
"_______________  I always enjoy joining our local organizations and community groups throughout the district to provide an update from Washington, answer questions and hear concerns and ideas from constituents."

_______________  I also enjoyed visiting Rain or Shine Golf and meeting owner Nancy Bergeron and her team.
I even got to work on my putting skills at their indoor putting green.
Thanks for the tour and letting me stop by!
Small businesses like these provide vital jobs and contribute to our local tourism!
_______________  I also stopped by the mobile office hours my office held at the Central Ridge Library in Beverly Hills.
"Our mobile office hours are designed to provide constituents a convenient way to interact with my staff who can assist them with issues involving federal agencies, including: *Department of Veterans Affairs *Social Security Administration *Internal Revenue Service *United States Postal Service *U.S."
Citizenship and Immigration Services There was a great turnout.
"Thank you to everybody who dropped by, we are happy to serve you!"
_______________   Wednesday marks 18 years since the attacks of 9/11.
"Congress will hold a moment of silence at 8:46 am to remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost that day."
"Recently, we passed legislation that extends the authorization and funding for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund (VCF) through 2090."
I supported this legislation.
Countless lives were saved that day thanks to the selfless bravery of first responders and strangers.
We remember and honor these brave individuals.
Many of them lost their lives that day and many of those who survived are battling physical ailments as a result of their heroic efforts.
"Your servant,     Daniel WebsterMember of Congress     Constituent Corner A county veterans’ services office had contacted us for help with a constituent whose VA exam request was going nowhere as it appeared there may have been an IT problem when the request was ticketed."
"We submitted an inquiry, the problem was identified and the exam resubmitted."
"However, progress was not being made, so a request was made to have a supervisor step in and get the exam scheduled."
"It was a pleasure to learn that the exam was finally held, allowing for the claim to go forward, resulting in a monthly benefit and a retroactive payment of over $10,000."
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you.
Legislative Update The Department of Defense announced $3.6 billion in funds last week that will go towards building the wall and addressing the national emergency at our southern border.
These funds will support 11 border barrier construction projects along the southern border.
"The funds are being transferred from projects that have been deferred, not cancelled."
"In addition, these funds help support our troops who have been deployed to the border and are working to stop the crisis we face."

Program with Rep. Scott and Academy Representatives        MOBILE OFFICES THIS WEEK  Our September mobile offices kick off this week.
"During mobile offices, staff from my district offices will be able to offer constituents assistance with federal issues ranging from Medicare and Social Security to veteran’s benefits."
We encourage those who have any questions on various issues to please come by during mobile offices and meet privately with staff.
Below are details of mobile offices happening this week.
"Dear Friend,  Last year, I sent a letter to search engine giant Google, challenging them to maintain proper protections for children's online privacy."
"I was inspired by twenty-three child and privacy advocacy groups, who, in April, 2018, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) arguing that Google’s YouTube online video and advertising network systematically collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of children under the age of 13 and sold that data to marketers in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)."
"This week, Google and its subsidiary YouTube agreed to pay a record $170 million to settle allegations that YouTube illegally collected personal data on children without parental consent."
"While a $170 million fine is a drop in the bucket to Google, it is ten times larger than all previous COPPA fines combined."
"To maintain its online search, advertising, and media dominance, Google collects vast amounts of data on our preferences, our friends’ preferences, and the sites we visit, while monitoring our daily conversations."
"By last measure, the market cap of Google was over $800 billion."
"To be fair, we agreed to Google’s Faustian bargain: Our privacy in exchange for their promise of convenience."
"We did not, however, give Google permission to track and monetize our children."
You’d think that Google would implicitly understand this.
"It seems to be in the nature of monopolies’ chase for quarterly profit, however, to lose sight of protections for the people they are intending to serve."
This might be due to a fundamental misunderstanding of capitalism itself.
"In his signature book, The Wealth of Nations, “the father of capitalism,” Adam Smith, articulated how free-market capitalism operates through an “invisible hand” to lift all boats."
"You may not have heard of Smith’s other major work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments."
"In it, the famed Scottish economist and philosopher articulated the necessary pre-condition of humane values essential to a properly functioning market."
"All over the world, we see examples of capitalism devoid of Smith’s moral sentiments."
"In our American experience, we naturally accept that the private market system accelerates possibility and opportunity for human well-being and flourishing."
"We also recognize that the “free” market can be distorted, manipulated, stacked, unfair."
Herein lies the tension.
"As some economists have noted, in the long run, the market takes care of all problems."
"The famous economist John Maynard Keynes retorted: Yes, but, in the long run, we are all dead."
"Thus, a regulating moral force (properly informed government) is needed to ensure that the market operates fairly."
Healthy competition births innovation.
"To its credit, Google won the public's trust in the free marketplace of ideas, not through stifled competition."
"Like the robber barons of old, however, Google lost sight of the Smithian sentiment of “sympathy,” which keeps Smithian “self-interest” in check."
"In the robber baron era, children were exploited through factory sweatshops."
"While it is more subtle and sanitized, in today’s big tech era, a new form of monopolistic exploitation of children has emerged: the tracking of their online behavior for profit."
"Sincerely, Congressman Jeff Fortenberry   P.S."
"If you would like to send my office an email reply, please visit my website, , or communicate with me on my  and  pages."
"Dear Cormack,  I’ve had a busy few weeks travelling across eastern Connecticut meeting with farmers, veterans, seniors, small business owners, and many other residents from just about every walk of life to discuss the issues that matter most to folks here in our region."
"Before Congress returns to Washington next week, I wanted to provide a quick overview of what I’ve been up to this summer."
"Whether it was the communities in the “Quiet Corner” of Windham County, the greater Capitol region of Hartford and Tolland counties or the southeastern and river valley regions along the shoreline, my travels over the last few weeks brought me to every corner of Connecticut's second Congressional District."
"Forums and Fairs in the Quiet Corner   The Quiet Corner has been buzzing with activity recently, and over the summer I’ve met with folks and attended events all throughout Windham County."
"I’ve had the chance to meet and speak with Quiet Corner veterans, seniors, and community leaders about some their top priorities during visits to the Ashford Senior Center, the Windham Veterans Coffeehouse, and the Putnam Rotary Club."
"From the cost of health care and prescription medication to stopping annoying robocalls, we covered a lot of ground during these conversations."
"Top: Congressman Courtney at the Ashford Senior Center Bottom: Congressman Courtney at the Windham Veterans Coffeehouse    It was great to have a chance to stop by Willimantic Waste earlier this summer for a tour of their brand new facility, and to receive an update on business operations from the DeVivo family."
"Willi Waste has been operating since the 1940s, and they’re a local leader in providing green and sustainable recycling services throughout the second district."
"Congressman Courtney at Willimantic Waste with co-owner Tom DeVivo    As eastern Connecticut residents know, with the close of summer comes the start of fair season."
"I had a great time at both the Brooklyn Fair and Woodstock Fair last month visiting local business stands and vendors, greeting some of the impressive show cattle from farms across our state region, and seeing friends for great food and music."
"I had the chance to help cut the ribbon to officially open this year’s corn maze at Fort Hill Farm in Thompson, and to stop by Fairholm Farm in Woodstock for a tour of the nearly century-old dairy farm."
"Left: Congressman Courtney at Fort Hill Farm in Woodstock Right: Congressman Courtney at the Woodstock Fair     Farms, Tariffs and Foundations in the Greater Capitol region   I’ve met with people all throughout the greater Capitol region of Hartford and Tolland Counties during this August district work period."
One of the highlights from the past few weeks was joining the Vernon Police Department’s Officer Cody Flanigan for a ride-along.
"Officer Flanigan is a total pro – he was named Vernon PD’s “Rookie of the Year” last year, he takes his role as a Community Police Officer seriously, and folks in Vernon and in Rockville feel comfortable going to him for assistance."
"To everyone in eastern Connecticut who wears the badge, or who works in law enforcement, thank you for your service."
And big thanks to Officer Flanigan for a great ride-along.
"Congressman Courtney with Officer Cody Flanigan of the Vernon Police Department    At Vernon Manor Healthcare, I provided important updates on the issue of health care affordability, including my “Medicare at 50” initiative."
"I also paid visits to Jarmoc Farms in Enfield, and to Hastings Farm in Suffield for updates on some new developments out at the farms."
"Jarmoc Farms is one of the first in our region to take advantage of the exciting new opportunity to grow and sell industrial hemp here in Connecticut, and Hastings Farm recently expanded their operations by opening a retail store that sells products straight from the farm."
Congressman Courtney at Hastings Farm in Suffield    In the past few weeks I’ve visited several small businesses throughout our region.
My meeting with CNC Software in Tolland included a detailed discussion of the impact that President Trump’s tariff war is having on their ability to move product and remain competitive – a consequence of this trade war that’s being felt by many businesses in our region.
"I also had the opportunity to drop by American Woolen in Stafford Springs for a tour of the historic Warren Mill, and to receive a few updates on some of their exciting new developments from American Woolen Founder and CEO, Jacob Long."
"Jacob has completely turned things around from the time when folks thought that the Warren Mill might close for good – it’s constantly humming with activity these days, and they’ve become a real example of excellence in the American textile industry."
Congressman Courtney touring American Woolen with founder and CEO Jacob Long and Governor Ned Lamont    There have also been some important developments regarding crumbling concrete foundations in the past few weeks.
"After News 8 reported that Eversource was springing “surprise bills” on crumbling foundations victims before they could move back home following repairs, I was on the phone working to coordinate a solution between Eversource and the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA)."
"Not long after, PURA met with Eversource and secured an agreement to cease the practice."
"I also stopped by Trinity College in Hartford for an update on their work to help eastern Connecticut residents test their basement concrete for the presence of the mineral pyrrhotite, a known contributor to the crumbling foundations crisis, and met with the town CEOs of Coventry, Stafford, Vernon, and Ellington to provide an update on federal relief through the federal Community Development Block Grant Program."
"Congressman Courtney at Trinity College with Dr. Christoph Geiss and Dr. Jonathan Gourley     A busy summer across the southern shoreline region   Advocating on behalf of our region’s seniors is one of my top priorities in Congress, and this district work period provided an important opportunity for me to hear directly from the source on priorities for the retired communities in Southeastern Connecticut."
"I want to extend a thank you to the Estuary Council of Seniors in Old Saybrook, the Senior Resource Agency in Norwich, and the Colchester Senior Center for hosting me last month, and for engaging with me on topics like immigration, the cost of prescription drugs, and more."
Congressman Courtney at the Colchester Senior Center    The final weeks of summer were busy across Southeastern Connecticut.
"I had the chance to join the Audubon Connecticut for a bird walk in in East Haddam alongside State Senator Norm Needleman, and to stop by both Brush Hill Farm and Hillandale Farms in Bozrah for an updates from the field."
"Congressman Courtney with members of Audubon Connecticut and State Senator Norm Needleman on a bird walk in East Haddam    From all corners of the district, my office has heard from small businesses owners and workers about the negative impact the President’s trade war is having their businesses and their livelihoods."
"My visit to Research & Design Innovations, LLC, a small business owned by Madison resident Don Allen, only underscored this message."
"Congressman Courtney touring RDI, LLC with owner and Madison resident Don Allen    Finally, as Chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee overseeing  Navy shipbuilding, I hosted Secretary of Defense Mark Esper in Groton for his first visit to Electric Boat as Secretary."
The visit was a great chance to demonstrate the incredible work underway at the shipyard to grow our undersea capabilities.
"Congressman Courtney joins Secretary of Defense Mark Esper for his first visit to Electric Boat in Groton     It’s been a busy August district work period, and this is only a snapshot of all of the meetings and events I shared with many of you over these past few weeks."
"For instance, I also hosted a Telephone Town Hall discussion with over 5,000 eastern Connecticut residents, my office hosted a in-person Congressional Update meeting at Kelly Middle School in Norwich in which I took questions from constituents, and I’ve been proud to announce a host of federal grant awards for projects in Essex, New London, Thompson, Putnam, Willimantic, and more."
"Your feedback and input is important as we tackle this work and enter into the busy session months ahead, and I hope you will take a moment to follow me on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to receive the latest updates on my work in Washington and Connecticut."
"Dear Friend,  Throughout the month of August, I had the opportunity to meet with many of you during my travels throughout West Texas, from our job creators, agriculture & energy producers, senior citizens, and many more."
"Now with school back in full swing and Congress coming back into session next week, I remain committed to advancing the policies and priorities that I heard about from the good people back home, which will ensure that our region stays strong and vibrant for decades to come."
"Celebrating the American Worker This Monday, we marked Labor Day, and thanks to the economic policies we’ve enacted under President Trump’s leadership, there has never been a better time to celebrate the American worker."
"By lowering taxes on American families, rolling back red tape, repealing onerous, burdensome regulations, and providing incentives for companies to invest in our country, our employment picture looks the best it has been in decades."
"Unemployment is near the lowest rate in 50 years, with 17 straight months of unemployment below 4% and over seven million job openings, including one million more jobs open than there are workers to fill them."
"Not only are people looking for work and finding work, including our veterans who are seeing an 18-year low in unemployment, they are also seeing more take home pay as well."
"In fact, wages are rising for workers at the fastest pace in over a decade."
"Perhaps most importantly, wages are rising the fastest for workers on the lower end of the income ladder."
"The ingenuity, entrepreneurial spirit, and the indomitable work ethnic of the American people is why we are the most prosperous, generous nation on the face of the planet."
Thank you to every West Texas worker for all the good you do for America!
"Confronting China There’s no question that, going forward, our nation’s greatest existential threat is the Communist-controlled People’s Republic of China."
"That is why I support our Negotiator-in-Chief, President Trump, holding firm in trade negotiations so we can secure a real and meaningful deal with China – not merely political window dressing."
"President Trump is right to take aim at China’s long history of abuse and cheating on the United States and its unfair trading practices – from theft of our intellectual property to forced technology transfer, mass state subsidies of their industries, and dumping of cheap product on the global market."
"I applaud the administration’s work to fight back against these economic abuses so we can ensure a more balanced, more reciprocal trade relationship in the years and decades ahead."
Click here to watch a conversation I had on Fox Business recently to talk trade and the latest on negotiations with China.
"Securing the Border and Stopping Illegal Immigration When it comes to welcoming immigrants, the United States is the most generous and compassionate nation in the world, but allowing for open borders and illegal immigration to persist is not compassionate for anyone, including those who are risking the safety of themselves and their families by making the dangerous trek to come to America."
"To help stem the tide of illegal immigration into our country, I recently introduced the Securing Comprehensive Review in Entry Enforcement Now (SCREEN) Act, which will ensure our already overwhelmed immigration system does not get further bogged down by those who abuse it."
"Not only will this legislation alleviate bureaucratic inefficiencies in the asylum process, it will also help reduce the troubling number of asylum seekers who have been released into the interior of our country, ensuring that migrants who do not have credible fear claims are not allowed in the United States in the first place."
"I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate, as well as the Trump Administration, to advance this legislative fix, which will fill a critical gap and close a loophole in our broken immigration process."
"Click here to learn more about my legislation, which advances my goal of securing our border and safeguarding our sovereignty as a nation."
Pro-American Energy Policies I was glad to be on hand in Lubbock last week to join EPA Region 6 Deputy Administrator David Gray for the announcement of a proposed rule on methane that will provide regulatory relief for our energy producers in West Texas and throughout the United States.
"It’s no secret that the heart of America’s economic prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and reliable supply of domestic energy."
The energy revolution and especially the innovations in technology we have seen from industry leaders here in West Texas in recent years have advanced our nation’s energy security while creating a significant reduction in carbon emissions.
"The EPA’s new rule will reduce unnecessary and burdensome regulations, empowering our energy producers, especially our small and independent producers, to continue to lead the way in our nation’s energy dominance and environmental stewardship."
"I applaud President Trump and his administration’s EPA for finding meaningful ways to balance the stewardship of our environment and economic growth, leaving our nation safer, stronger, and cleaner for our children and grandchildren."

"The Hub City During my time in Lubbock last week, I also had the opportunity to meet with some of our local community leaders."
"Small businesses are the cornerstone of rural communities and the engine of the American economy, and I was pleased to speak with local business leaders at a Lubbock Chamber of Commerce roundtable."
"I also enjoyed getting to break bread and provide a legislative update to folks from the Texas Farm Bureau and the Plains Ginners Association, two groups that play a critical role in representing our region’s agriculture interests and the needs of rural America so well."
Thanks for all you do for West Texas!
"The Red Raiders football team started the 2019 season off strong by storming past Montana State, 45-10, marking Matt Wells’ first win as Head Coach."
"This week, Tech will be back on the gridiron taking on University of Texas-El Paso for the annual Agriculture Game, which celebrates all things ag, from cotton to beef and other crops on the South Plains, as well as everything that makes Texas Tech a leader in the agriculture industry."
"Dear Lindsey,  Join me THIS FRIDAY, September 6, for an Immigration and Government Panel, with special guest Connecticut Attorney General William Tong!"
"This idea for this event was created, planned, and executed by one of my wonderful interns."
"Not only will it be a great opportunity to learn more about the state of immigration in our nation and Connecticut, but it is also an opportunity to support our young people as they proactively create change within our community."
I hope to see you there!

"Dear Friend,   Thank you for taking a moment to learn about what happened here in Texas last week."
"Leading the Fight Against Hate CrimesSadly, last year, hate crimes in Houston rose to a 10-year high."
"The Houston Police Department confirmed people were targeted for their race, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity."
That's one reason why I was proud to join my colleague Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) to introduce H.R.
"3545 - the National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act earlier this year."
"This important, bi-partisan bill strengthens existing federal hate crimes statutes by incentivizing better training, reporting, and prevention."
I was honored to receive strong community support from area civil rights and faith leaders at a recent press conference backing this critical legislation.
"The event took place at St. John Baptist Church, a historically black church still recovering after a 2006 arson attack suspected as a hate crime."
Hate has no place in TX-22!

George    Congressional Update in Clear Lake It was an honor to join my Houston colleagues Randy Weber and Brian Babin at a recent Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce event.
"We discussed trade, taxes and the great work being done by our Johnson Space Center employees."
The Clear Lake Chamber continues to do excellent work promoting business and entrepreneurship to keep our communities thriving and our economy booming!
Olson provides an update to Clear Lake Chamber members    Keeping TX-22 on the Cutting Edge of InnovationTechnology is the future of our economy.
"As a member of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, I'm committed to help our TX-22 businesses lead the way."
An important part of this effort is learning how the federal government helps or hinders this emerging industry.
My Emerging Technologies Advisory Council provides critical feedback on federal policies that I can bring to Washington.
"Last week, I hosted a working lunch to learn the latest developments at the intersection of the technology, science and labor sectors."
These entrepreneurs and tech-savvy business leaders know that innovation is at the core of job growth in TX-22 and vital to continuing our nation's booming economy.
Olson with members of his Emerging Technologies Advisory Council    I'm honored to represent you in Congress.
"Dear Friend,  I hope you enjoyed a relaxing Labor Day with your friends and family over the long weekend!"
"Summer flew by and somehow, it is already September."
"Thanks to every Hoosier from the various counties, cities and towns across the Fifth District I was able to meet with throughout August."
I’m energized and ready for what is going to be a busy fall.
Scroll through the remainder of this newsletter for a brief overview of August’s work:  Vice President Pence hosted a roundtable discussion at the Indiana State Police Museum in Indianapolis last week.
"It was a privilege and an honor to join Vice President Pence, Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter, Debbie and Mike Laird, and other leaders of law enforcement to discuss how we can work together to reduce gun violence in our country."
"Red flag laws and bills, such as the bipartisan Jake Laird Act I re-introduced earlier this year, are a critically important part of the solution."
"Indiana is one of 17 states that currently have a “red flag” law, and four other states are considering similar legislation."
The Jake Laird Law allows law enforcement officials in Indiana to temporarily remove weapons from an individual who could be a danger to themselves or others.
You can learn more about the significance of red flag laws by watching these conversations with CBS4 and WISHTV.
"RELATED NEWS: Greentown officers used Jake Laird Law last month to confiscate 7 guns after shooting & Rep. Brooks hopeful states adopt red flag laws  Participated in the ribbon cutting of the Anderson’s Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge, visited Italpollina’s new location and lab with the CEO Luca Bonini and wife, and met with Anderson University’s president and faculty this month."
"Elected officials, community leaders and supporters gathered in Anderson for the dedication of the city’s Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Memorial Bridge, which links businesses, commuters, bicyclists and pedestrians to downtown Anderson."
This bridge is now dedicated to men and women of Madison County who bravely served our country in the armed forces.
"Also in Anderson, I appreciated the opportunity to visit Italpollina’s North American headquarters and learn of their many successes since the company opened in Italy in 1973."
They are newly located in Anderson and operate in 70+ countries worldwide and offer a range of biotechnological and certification solutions for sustainable modern agriculture.
"Lastly, thank you to the President of Anderson University, John Pistole, and faculty members for inviting me to learn more about their new cybersecurity major, the National Security Studies Program as well as their new Tech Talent Incubator."
"Exciting, new things are happening at the university and I am pleased to hear of the new courses focused on securing and protecting our nation."
Joined the Indiana Soybean Alliance/Indiana Corn Marketing Council at a Greentown Shop Talk event at Kirkpatrick Farms.
Agriculture contributes an estimated $31.2 billion to Indiana’s economy!
Our agricultural producers and growers are the reason we are able to put fresh produce on our kitchen tables and enjoy the seasonal goods we look forward to every year.
"Farmers from communities across the Fifth District joined me for an important discussion on tariffs, trade and extreme weather conditions that made this season especially difficult."
I will continue to work to ensure Hoosier farmers have the tools and resources needed as they work to feed families in Indiana and beyond.
"Pictured Bob Dubois, Noblesville Chamber President, Aaron Head, Economic Development Specialist of Noblesville, Mayor-Elect Chris Jensen, Deanna Leonard and Erin Goodman, the two owners of Caravan Classes, and Deputy Mayor Steve Cooke."
"The City of Noblesville is vibrant and continues to see economic growth and expansion, while keeping the small town feel alive in Hamilton County."
"I enjoyed a Noblesville Downtown Main Street Tour in order to visit with local business owners to discuss workforce development, expanding operations, the successes they have seen as well as the challenges they face in the community."
"I stopped in at Grindstone Public House, a restaurant right off the corner of main street Noblesville; Karisma, a fashion boutique whose owner hires high school students for their first working experience or summer job; and Caravan Classes, an art studio that allows space for creative minds and provides a mobile, pop up art studio for events and parties."
"Thank you to the many individuals and advocacy organizations, including advocates like AARP, who came to speak with me at my “Connect with Your Congresswoman” event at the Anderson Impact Center."
"For those of you who haven’t attended a Connect event, they are meetings for all who live in the Fifth District to attend where I can meet with constituents about matters that you care about most."
I am proud to represent such passionate and thoughtful residents of the Fifth District.
"If you didn’t have a chance to meet with me in August, not to worry."
I’ll be hosting another Connect event when I am home this fall.
The schedule of upcoming Connect events will be posted on my website as they are scheduled.
I look forward to meeting and speaking with more of you in the months to come.
Thank you to everyone who came to the event.
"As a proud member of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, I hosted a roundtable discussion in Carmel with Indiana advocacy organizations who regularly engage with government about how Congress can better interact with constituents and advocacy groups."
"Additionally, I also had the opportunity to:   speak at the Sertoma Club of Broad Ripple, the Bread for the World event in Noblesville, and the Indiana Cast Metal Association Member Dinner in Marion; meet with Fishers Chief of Police, Chief Ed Gebhart, who shared with me how Fishers Police’s new Mental Health Task Force is working to better our community; and visit the new NeuroDiagnostics Institute and Advanced Treatment Center for mental health services, substance abuse treatment and recovery in Indianapolis."
"*Wicker Spearheads Ole Miss Tech Summit* *Leaders Gather in Oxford to Discuss Technology, Connectivity, and Innovation* The annual Ole Miss Technology Summit, which took place in Oxford at the end of August, brings together leaders to discuss how science, technology, and innovation are shaping our state and nation's future."
"I was a part of the inaugural event in 2016, and I have spoken at each successive meeting."
"The fourth summit was the largest and most impressive yet, and I was glad to join this time in my role as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee."
"This Tech Summit brought Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai, senior executives from companies like Comcast, NBC, DISH Network, and Google, and Ole Miss's top researchers into the same room so that we could understand the challenges and opportunities ahead."
"Mississippi has played an essential and historic role in technological progress, as I detailed in my remarks."
"The red glare of the Apollo 11 rocket engine that sent three men to the Moon in 1969 and transfixed hundreds of millions of people was first seen at Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, where the Saturn V was tested."
*Technology's Promise* Ensuring that the promises of technology and connectivity are available to every American is among my top priorities.
It starts with creating an economic environment where private companies work to close the digital divide between rural and urban areas.
"The day before the Tech Summit, Chairman Pai and I were in Fulton, Mississippi, to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for Fulton Telephone Company's ""Fiber to the Home Initiative."""
"We helped test this new, high-speed connection, and it was a pleasure to witness a small part of the divide close before our eyes."
Furthering this effort requires Congress to work with the FCC to understand where broadband is available and where it is not.
"The maps the agency had been planning to use for this were based on sometimes faulty data, which would have resulted in overbuilding in some areas and no connectivity at all in others."
"The Commerce Committee recently passed legislation I sponsored called the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act, which would require the FCC to improve its maps and provide the incentives to collect better data about broadband availability."
"The FCC understands this is a problem, and Chairman Pai is taking action through a new Digital Opportunity Data Collection program, which will incorporate feedback directly from the public."
"As Internet services reach more rural Americans, it is vital that this country remain on the cutting edge of new technologies."
That means winning the race to 5G - the next generation of broadband.
"This will open up new opportunities, create millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth, and allow for new uses of Internet services."
"For example, autonomous vehicles will soon move goods and people, saving time, money, and potentially thousands of lives as car crashes caused by human errors are taken out of the equation."
*The Next Moonshot* The Ole Miss Tech Summit was not only about the leaders on stage.
"It was also about the students who just started classes and the young people across our state who will benefit from, use, and create their own new technologies."
"Some of these students presented during the summit, and it was encouraging to hear their ideas and their optimism."
The Apollo Program inspired my generation to think big and to be limited only by the power of our imaginations.
"Future generations have the same pioneering spirit, and I am working in Congress to ensure that they have the tools needed to make their moonshots."

"Dear Friend, On Tuesday the long-awaited new North Canton post office officially opened for business!"
There are very few things that are as essential a part of government as ensuring communities have the ability to send and receive mail.
"This was a big win for North Canton which has gone far too long without its own post office, and I am honored that my office could help get this project across the finish line."
Keeping the Great Lakes strongThis week I also visited the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District’s Environmental and Maintenance Service Center to see the great work they are doing to help keep Lake Erie and our local waterways healthy and productive for generations to come.
"The Great Lakes are a critical part of Northeast Ohio, not just for recreational purposes, but also for our growing economy."
"I’ve been working hard in Congress as a member of the Great Lakes Task Force to ensure the continued health of the Great Lakes, including supporting and cosponsoring legislation that promotes cutting edge research and ensures we have the knowledge and tools to keep our lakes and fisheries healthy and productive."
I look forward to continuing to work with the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District and other local organizations to ensure our waterways are supported now and into the future.
Innovative care for Northeast Ohio's kidsI paid a visit to Akron Children’s Hospital on Wednesday to talk about federal funding for children’s health initiatives and the importance of population health to lowering cost of care and ensuring healthier children in Northeast Ohio and beyond.
"Akron Children’s Hospital takes an integrated approach to care where pediatricians, mental health therapists and specialty doctors are all located in one facility in the community to help provide the best care possible for our children."
Innovation like this is key to ensuring healthcare for our kids is always moving forward.
I appreciated the opportunity to see the work Akron Children’s Hospital is doing for Northeast Ohio and am proud to welcome them to North Canton!
Bringing tech and innovation to the forefront in Northeast Ohio On Thursday I joined BioEnterprise Corporation for a roundtable to discuss the importance of helping bioscience and medical innovators grow their companies here in Northeast Ohio and make our community a destination for young families and innovators nationwide.
"My biggest goal in Congress is to help move our Northeast Ohio economy forward by making our region a destination for young families, entrepreneurs and innovators to lay down roots."
"We are ripe for new businesses and research and development in new and emerging technologies thanks to our talented workforce, and companies like BioEnterprise Corporation are key to promoting this type of investment in our community."
Our affordable housing market also makes us an attractive destination for young families looking for a place to call home.
There is no reason why Northeast Ohio should not be on the top of the list for any entrepreneur looking for cities to locate their operations.
"It is my hope that by working alongside companies like BioEnterprise who are helping bioscience and medical innovators grow their companies here in Cleveland, we will be able to develop a robust and diverse economy that will keep Northeast Ohio on the leading edge for generations to come."
"Don’t miss my next Veterans Resource Tour event!My office is hosting another Veterans Resource Tour event on Wednesday, September 4 at the MAPS Air Museum in North Canton with a special forum on resources available specifically for veteran entrepreneurs."
"The forum will kick off at 10:00 a.m. to help veterans discover how they can use Small Business Administration loan programs, veteran services and procurement programs to start or grow a business."
The main resource fair will begin at 2:00 p.m.
"If you would like to attend the forum, please register in advance via Eventbrite here."
No pre-registration is needed for the resource fair portion of the event.

"Dear Cormack,  Following a busy week across the district, here with an update on a few important issues and priorities facing our region and state."
"Welcoming Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to Groton  On Tuesday, I welcomed U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper to eastern Connecticut for a visit to General Dynamics Electric Boat (EB)."
"I joined Secretary Esper along with Governor Lamont, EB President Jeff Geiger, and other elected officials from Connecticut and Rhode Island for a tour of EB and some of the work underway at the yard."
We also discussed the strategic importance of submarine construction at EB and the crucial role they play in the readiness and expansion of our undersea fleet.
"From my ongoing effort to expand attack submarine construction beyond 2 Virginia-class submarines per year, to the decision to move additional maintenance work to the shipyard in Groton, there’s been a lot of activity at EB this year, and it’s been great to see EB reporting on new employment statistics that show a major increase in the number of young people they’re hiring and attracting to eastern Connecticut."
"That’s all good news, because the workload doesn’t appear to be slowing down: this year, in my first year as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces (which oversees much of the work being done at EB), the House authorized and appropriated funding for my effort to construct a 3rd Virginia-class submarine, and we have the first Columbia-class submarine on the horizon."
"EB is moving at a steady clip in terms workload and employment, and they’ll continue to be a critical partner to our U.S. Navy as we work to modernize and expand our submarine fleet."
It was great to have Secretary Esper join us in eastern Connecticut to see just how important our region and our manufacturers are to the U.S. Navy and to our national security.
Thanks to Mr. Geiger and our hardworking shipbuilders at EB for the great tour.
"Rep. Courtney, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and others prepare for a tour of Electric Boat   An Update for Homeowners with Crumbling Foundations  Addressing our region’s crumbling foundations crisis is one of my top priorities in Congress."
"This week, I’ve been working on the phone and on-site at Trinity College to help tackle some newly emerging issues, and to get an update on important research needed to better understand and solve the problem."
News 8’s George Colli reported last week that eastern Connecticut homeowners who were moving back into their homes following crumbling concrete basement repairs were being charged with “surprise bills” from Eversource to reactivate their gas lines.
"For homeowners and families already operating on tighter budgets due to steep, unforeseen costs to repair crumbling foundations and basements, the costs from Eversource added insult to injury."
"Some families reported being charged as much as $1,600 by the utility before they could move back in."
"This was alarming news, and as soon we learned about the situation I was on the phone with John Betkoski, Vice Chairman of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), to find a way to work together with Eversource to get it fixed."
"Late last Friday night, we got the announcement we were looking for: Eversource issued a statement that they have re-evaluated their policy, and won’t be charging these fees to homeowners impacted by crumbling concrete basements."
They also stated that they would reimburse impacted ratepayers who have already made payments.
"This is a huge relief for eastern Connecticut homeowners and families, and it’s the right thing to do."
Kudos to John Betkoski for helping to get the end result.
"To read more on Eversource’s decision to change their policy, click here."
"On Thursday of this week, I stopped by Trinity College in Hartford to tour the laboratories of their Environmental Science Program, where they’re currently assisting eastern Connecticut residents to test for the mineral pyrrhotite – a known contributor to the crumbling foundations crisis – in their basement concrete."
"I was joined by Tim Heim, the founder of the group Connecticut Coalition Against Crumbling Basements, and we were led on the tour by Trinity College researchers Dr. Christoph Geiss and Dr. Jonathan Gourley, who gave us an overview of some of their work."
"The Journal Inquirer's Eric Bedner covered my visit, and wrote a bit more about some of my other efforts to address the crumbling foundations crisis, including an amendment I recently passed in the House to provide $4 million for federal research into the effects of pyrrhotite on concrete aggregate."
Click here to read the full story.
"The research being done at Trinity College’s labs is important – we need to be able to detect pyrrhotite in concrete in order to address it, and we have to keep gathering all of the information we can to understand the true effect of pyrrhotite on concrete."
"I’ll keep pushing for a better understanding of this crisis, and towards more resources for homeowners impacted by it."
"Dr. Christoph Geiss and Dr. Jonathan Gourley share some details of their research with Rep. Courtney   Honoring the Crew of the USS Hartford with the Yard Goats  We had a great time on Thursday night celebrating the men and women of the USS Hartford, and it’s something we’ve been looking forward to for some time."
"Back in June, I was honored to be presented with a ball cap from the USS Hartford – a Los Angeles-class submarine stationed here in eastern Connecticut."
"I had the chance to return their kindness on Thursday, and to help recognize our sailors who really deserve it when we hosted the sailors of the USS Hartford at the final Hartford Yard Goats home game of the year."
Before the first pitch – thrown out by Chief Mike Covington -- the crew of the Hartford took to the field as the crowd stood to honor them for their exemplary service.
"Just last year, the crew of the Hartford were named winners of the 2017 Battenberg Cup, beating nearly 100 other Naval vessels to be named the best all-around ship or submarine in the entire Atlantic fleet—an award that dates all the way back to 1905."
The USS Hartford participated in the past two ICEX events — ice exercises that test sailors’ ability to complete challenging missions in the Arctic – and at the start of 2017 it received the Battle “E” Award as the  best ship in its squadron.
"The sailors of the USS Hartford have accomplished a great deal, and I was glad to have the opportunity to help thank and honor them for their service this week."
Thank you to the Hartford Yard Goats for a great game—a 10-4 win!—and for helping us to give the crew of the USS Hartford some special recognition.
"And a very big thank you to the men and women of the USS Hartford for joining us at the game – it was my pleasure to host them, and to join the crowd in thanking them for their service."
"Rep. Courtney hosts the crew of the USS Hartford at the final Hartford Yard Goats home game of the season    Protecting Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs Eastern Connecticut is home to some of the best manufacturers in the country, and folks who work in the industry know how just important our Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs) are to attracting, training, and preparing folks for their careers."
"On Thursday, I was joined by Congressman John Larson (CT-01), Joe Toner, President of the Greater Hartford-New Britain Building Trades Council, and Dave Hunt, President of Berlin Steel and of the Connecticut Ironworkers Employers Association, for a public discussion on a recently proposed rule by the Department of Labor (DOL) that would outsource the oversight of highly effective and widely supported IRAPs to private, non-union firms."
"The rule being proposed by the DOL is like a fox guarding the henhouse, according to one publication – it would put less-than-reputable contractors in charge of crafting new, non-registered apprenticeship programs with little government oversight, creating duplicative, unnecessary, and lower-quality “industry-recognized” programs that wouldn’t' provide the same benefits and protections to apprentices as do our long-established, registered apprenticeships."
"What’s perhaps most concerning is that workers and unions were left with little time to weigh in on the proposed rule change – the DOL worked to keep the public comment period for the rule as truncated as possible, leaving impacted industry representatives and unions with little voice in the matter."
"We got together on Thursday to call on the DOL to expand the public comment period to give people an actual chance to weigh in on the issue, and to call more attention to this proposed rule and the impact it could have on the well-being of apprentices and on the manufacturing industry at-large."
"Manufacturing plays a huge role in our state’s economy, and people who work in the industry deserve the same workplace protections and training expertise their predecessors have been able to access in years past."
"Rep. Courtney joins labor union members and leaders to highlight the importance of protecting apprenticeships    Trump Tariffs Continue to Impact Connecticut Businesses  I was in Tolland on Thursday morning to meet with CNC Software and their CEO, Meghan West, who invited me to visit so that we could discuss the impact President Trump’s ongoing tariff war is having on her business."
CNC Software an eastern Connecticut business that has been operating for over 35 years.
"They specialize in creating computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology, which is used all throughout the manufacturing industry – from designing and creation of prototypes and finished products, to production runs, and more."
"CNC has provided CAD/CAM solutions to firms worldwide in the mold-making, automotive, aerospace, and consumer industries."
"Thousands of small businesses across the country have suffered while this Administration has continued to increase economic tensions with China, including some of our own local businesses here in Connecticut."
"Meghan reports that in the fall of 2018, a 5% tariff was added to the sale of all of CNC’s software in mainland China."
"Just last week I visited Research & Design Innovations (RDI) LLC, whose owner said that the increase of material costs due to the trade war are hurting his company’s ability to do business."
"Earlier this year, Garbo Lobster was forced to shutter their doors permanently, and I helped its employees to secure Trade Adjustment Assistance through the Department of Labor (DOL) – an acknowledgement by DOL that the closure of Garbo was brought about by changes in trade policy."
"The question here is not the diagnosis: China is a bad actor on the international economic stage, there is bipartisan agreement on that."
The question is whether this Administration has provided the right prescription to solve the problem by going-it-alone in a tariff war that’s already harming our small businesses here at home.
"I am committed to working alongside my colleagues in Congress to ensure that protections are in place for the thousands of businesses that have been impacted by the Chinese tariffs, and to fighting for a better way to address China’s behavior on the global stage by working with our allies around the world."
"Congressman Courtney meets with CNC Software CEO Meghan West & her team at their office in Tolland    Thank You for Participating in my Congressional Update We had some productive conversations at my Congressional Update at Kelly Middle school in Norwich on Monday night, and I want to sincerely thank all of you who were able to join us."
"It was great to see everyone, and to have a chance to hear from our community on a wide array of issues."
"From the cost of health care and prescription medication, to improving social security, gun laws and more, we covered a lot of ground throughout our conversations on Monday."
We also spent some time covering some of the bills the House of Representatives have gotten to work on and passed during our first 200 days of this Congress.
"To see a list of some of this work, click here to check out my 2019 Mid-Session Update on my website."
"Thanks again to everyone who was able to join us, and be sure to look out for similar events in the near future."
"Rep. Courtney addresses the audience at his Congressional Update    I hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my work, and as always thank you for taking a moment to read my weekly update."
"News from Representative Steve Womack                                       3RD DISTRICT                                     August 30, 2019    WEEK IN REVIEW To start off this week’s From the Front, I would like to thank all of the Arkansans who stopped by my Washington office during their visits to our nation’s capital, including Michael and Kelley Weir of Springdale and Anthony and Rhonda Doss of Springdale."
Safe travels back to the Natural State!
August is one of my favorite times of the year because it allows for several weeks of in-district work.
"I have used the month to make stops throughout the Third District and meet with constituents, families, businesses, students, and friends."
"From Russellville and Fort Smith to Rogers and Springdale, it was another busy week around AR-3."
"As your representative in Congress, one of my priorities is to do everything possible to build stronger communities and greater opportunity in our district."
Getting guidance and insight from local officials is critical to that process.
"I enjoyed meeting with Russellville Mayor Richard Harris, Atkins Mayor Rowdy Sweet, Pottsville Mayor Randy Tankersley, Hector Mayor Carey McGee, and County Judge Ben Cross to talk about the development and growth happening in the River Valley."
"We discussed upcoming project developments, business expansions, infrastructure, and bike trail projects."
I appreciated their time and all the work they do for Arkansans.
I then headed to Pottsville High School to talk with the senior class about their goals and the importance of being leaders.
"These young adults are at a pivotal moment in their lives, where their decisions, both good and bad, will have a lasting impact on the trajectory of their futures."
"We discussed the importance of education, good behavior, health, and service to others."
"As I told them, they are all the next generation of leaders."
"If they maximize and leverage their skills, not only will they find success - but America will also be stronger."
Mediocrity is not an option for these students - I want them to challenge themselves and push each other to be the best they can be.
"They asked great questions, and we even made sure to do a “Go Apaches!” call at the end of the assembly!"
"A big thank you to the students, school leadership, teachers, School Superintendent Larry Dugger, and Jonathan Bradley for their time!"
Our community is home to extraordinary people and organizations.
"I had the opportunity to visit Russ Buss, a faith-based non-profit that provides resources and help to those in need."
"The organization, which is run by Fred Teague and supported by volunteers and donors, has a mission of providing homeless residents and others who have fallen on hard times with housing and assistance."
"Russ Buss also provides life-skills classes, including learning how to budget, develop savings, attain a job, write a resume, and develop workforce skills."
"It’s about providing people with a hand up, not a handout."
Incredible stories of those overcoming addiction and the longstanding change that Russ Buss has helped people achieve!
Arming those facing hardship with the resources needed to succeed will allow them to improve their lives and reach their full potential.
"I also made a visit to my alma mater, Arkansas Tech University, to check out the recently opened lounge area for student veterans."
Freedom is a gift from our service members and veterans.
"We must support our troops when they come home, and facilities like Arkansas Tech University’s Student Veterans Lounge help students as they transition back into civilian life and work toward their college degree."
"After my tour, I headed to Witherspoon Auditorium to kick off my second town hall event."
I thank all of the Russellville residents who took time out of their schedules to attend.
It was great to see so many constituents take part in civic engagement and discuss their priority issues.
"We covered a range of questions and topics, including social security, immigration, college affordability, and deficits and debts."
Transportation is a vital part of our region.
"Smart investments that modernize critical infrastructure are vital to the future growth and economic success of Arkansas, and I appreciated meeting with Arkansas Highway Commissioner Keith Gibson to discuss transportation, road, and economic development planning."
I then headed down the road to speak at the Arkansas Economic Developers and Chamber Executives Annual Conference.
I’m proud to say that Arkansas is open for business.
"With low unemployment, job and wage growth, and investments in workforce training, our state is economically strong."
"While there is lots of development and opportunity in our region, we still have challenges."
"Building our pipeline of skilled labor, workforce training programs, and recruitment are all things we need to concentrate on to keep our competitive advantage."
"With states across the nation working to draw companies to their neighborhoods, it’s vital that we are making investments that will attract residents, job creators, entrepreneurs, and workers."
"The adage “retail follows rooftops” reminds us that we all have a stake in building dynamic communities that boast strong schools, public safety, hospitals, and infrastructure."
My next stop was to the Arkansas College of Health Education in Fort Smith to speak at the Healthcare Executive Summit.
"We have healthcare challenges: access and affordability, prescription drug prices, quality of care, the structure of our medical system, and much more."
"There is an intense national debate over the future of some of these problems, and an open dialogue is necessary to finding real solutions."
"So that means we need to concentrate more on effective reforms, not unrealistic proposals like Medicare-for-All, which would eliminate private insurance."
It’s time to bring conversations back to reality.
"We need to focus on forward-looking and even-handed policies that increase transparency, move research forward, prioritize the patient-doctor relationship, and incentivize an innovative medical environment."
We all forget things from time to time.
"But for some, it’s not just a quick slip of the mind; it’s the initial symptom to a life-changing diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and a new and uncertain reality."
"We must care for those suffering from this disease, as well as our senior citizens who might need a little more help from day to day."
That’s why facilities like the Methodist Village Memory Care and Assisted Living center are so important.
I toured this facility and was amazed to see the dedication to long-term and quality care firsthand.
"I appreciated the great conversation with staff, nurses, doctors, and residents."
"One of the highlights of my visit was meeting Harold Mainer, a WWII veteran who survived the attack on Pearl Harbor."
The heroic acts of our Greatest Generation must always be remembered.
We owe them the freedom we enjoy today.
God bless Mr. Mainer and all those who have served.
"The following day, I joined the Bentonville Noon Rotary Club."
I got to pick out the opening song.
You’re a Grand Old Flag!
"I then gave a Washington update and discussed the Rotary ""4-Way Test,"" and how I think about it when analyzing policy proposals."
• Is it fair to all concerned?
• Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
• Will it be beneficial to all concerned?
"Next on the agenda was a tour of Mundo-Tech, an important manufacturing facility that is based in Rogers."
"Mundo-Tech produces specialty tubing and pipes for the aerospace, defense, and commercial airline industries."
"Whether you are in the military or a resident traveling to your next vacation or business destination, it is likely that the aircraft you are flying in includes products from the Third District."
Mundo-Tech recently made a major investment and is in the process of expanding its facility.
The increased capacity will allow them to grow their supply production and workforce.
They are a great example of a family-owned Arkansas business that is helping move and protect Americans each day.
"Their mission statement is “Flight or Fight - We Deliver!”  I then headed back to my Rogers District Office to meet with Ralph Bishop about the opioid crisis, Kat Lynch to discuss the challenges of adolescent Type 1 Diabetes and research, and Randy Massanelli to talk about program development at the University of Arkansas."
I ended the day with hosting my Northwest Arkansas Town Hall in Rogers.
"These events allow me to hear directly from the people of Arkansas’s Third District about issues impacting individuals, families, and businesses in our community."
"During the hour-long town hall, I answered questions, listened to ideas, and discussed various subjects with residents."
"Whether we agree or disagree on certain topics, I appreciated having an open and engaging dialogue."
"The next morning, I drove to Springdale to take part in the Springdale Chamber of Commerce’s weekly meeting."
We’ve seen a lot of downtown revitalization and growth – and gatherings like this support those efforts.
I wrapped up the week by visiting with Ozark Regional Transit.
Investments into transportation infrastructure support #AR3 and its continued growth.
ORT recently received two U.S. Department of Transportation grants to purchase new buses and build a modern facility.
I was grateful to see our joint advocacy in Congress turn into increased resources for local transit services!
Wishing you a great weekend and a happy Labor Day!
American workers move our country and are a critical part of the strong economy we see today.

A big thank you to everyone who has taken time to meet with me so far to share new thoughts and ideas and provide genuine feedback.
I truly value your input!
Vice President Mike Pence in SC03   It was great to welcome Vice President Mike Pence to the Upstate to talk about the USMCA at Sargent Metal Fabricators in Anderson!
"We need America first trade deals, and it is refreshing to have an Administration that is constantly fighting for them."
"The Vice President delivered an amazing speech:   ""As I leave today, I leave with renewed confidence — confidence in this President, in his relentless determination to make this country safe and prosperous again."
"Confidence in each and every one of you in the great state of South Carolina, the state that is synonymous with all that’s best about America: faith, and family, and freedom."
"That as you let your voice be heard, then we’ll continue to make the progress that we’ve made, not just in this state, but all across this country."""
You can read his full remarks HERE.
"Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for coming to South Carolina’s 3rd District!"
"In case you missed my op-ed on the issue: “We Need America First Trade Deals” ran in Greenville Business Magazine, and you can check it out HERE."
Saluda County Water and Sewer Water Treatment Plant Ribbon Cutting  The new state of the art Saluda County Water and Sewer Water Treatment Plant facility will positively benefit the community for years to come.
I enjoyed attending the ribbon cutting.
Thanks for having me!
Lake Fees Update I am still hard at work with several colleagues from North Carolina and Georgia fighting for more answers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the dock and facility permit fee increases.
"Most recently, we sent a second letter to the Corps demanding a more thorough explanation on the anticipated cost increase."
"For more information, please read my press release on the issue HERE."
I’ll be sure to keep you updated.
F-16 Block 70 Update This month I joined the South Carolina Congressional Delegation in signing a letter to President Trump in support of Taiwan’s interest in purchasing the South Carolina manufactured F-16 Block 70 fighter aircrafts.
"The Trump Administration recently came out in support of this, and I know the decision will make a huge impact on the Upstate."
You can read the letter HERE.
"Congressional App Challenge   Registration for the Congressional App Challenge is still open, folks!"
My staff has mailed thirty-nine flyers to various high schools and tech schools around the district with details on how to participate this year.
The annual challenge gives students the opportunity to learn how to code and create apps.
"For more information, visit the website HERE."
"Christmas at the White House Planning for the 2019 Christmas season is underway at the White House, and it would be great to have South Carolina representation there to help celebrate the reason for the season."
"Apply by September 10, 2019 to volunteer for musical performances."
You can visit the website HERE for more details!
It is an honor to serve the people of the Third District of South Carolina.
"I appreciate your support, and I look forward to taking your input back to Washington so I can better serve you in Congress."

It was great to talk with constituents and promote the importance of the agriculture sector and dairy industry to our North Country economy.
The highlight of my summer is always competing in the annual milking contest with the Dairy Princesses and Ambassadors.

"Reflecting on the Congressional Delegation to Israel    A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit Israel with the largest ever bipartisan Congressional Delegation to the country, traveling with over 40 Democrats and 30 Republicans."
"I spoke with the Adirondack Daily Enterprise about my trip, which was on their front page earlier this week."
"From the Enterprise:  She had a schedule packed with back-to-back meetings and briefings, including conversations with Israeli military leaders and a discussion with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."
"She also visited regions close to the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian territory mostly surrounded by Israel, and the Golan Heights, an Israeli-occupied region captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War."
"In March, U.S. President Donald Trump broke with global convention and declared that the U.S. recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights."
“Israel and the U.S. have a special relationship.
"They are one of our most important allies around the world,” Stefanik said."
"“We have shared values when it comes to democratic values, when it comes to freedom of different faiths in their region."
"The fact that they are this thriving democracy is an anomaly in the Middle East today.” Stefanik said Israel faces border threats from Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip."
"“It’s pretty clear, when you’re in Israel, they are in a very tough neighborhood,” Stefanik said."
"“To see how small, geographically, the country is, and how really almost every border, except maybe the Jordanian border, they are under severe security challenges.” She said she visited an “Iron Dome” missile defense system the U.S. worked to develop with Israel."
One of these defense systems is estimated to have a 90% success rate in intercepting inbound rockets.
"“We were able to hear from some of the individuals and families that live on the kibbutz that face these sirens from rockets that go off on a weekly basis,” Stefanik said."
"“To hear their personal stories was pretty powerful.”   To read the full article, click here."
"The ""Moving Wall"" in Sackets Harbor      Our Wounded Warrior Program Fellow in my Watertown District Office had the opportunity to attend the Moving Wall event in Sackets Harbor over the weekend."
"The Moving Wall is a replica of the original Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. Members of the Association of the U.S. Army and Fort Drum’s 41st Engineer Battalion 2nd Brigade Combat Team assembled the Wall."
"margin-bottom: 1em; } table.menu-change a { text-decoration:none; } /* pre-header */ .preheader { display:none !important; visibility:hidden; mso-hide:all !important; font-size:0px; color:#ffffff; line-height:0px; max-height:0px; max-width:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; }                                                                On Taxpayers’ Dime, Pentagon Buys Chinese Computers Vulnerable to Hacking  Last year, the Department of Defense (DoD) bought thousands of computer products and other electronics with KNOWN cybersecurity risks, including equipment from a company with connections to…the Chinese government."
"For more than a decade, government agencies—including DoD’s own Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate—have repeatedly issued warnings about the dangers of using technology from the largest computer company in China."
"And if these repeated warnings weren’t enough, the Pentagon’s own Inspector General (OIG) said this compromises critical national security missions."
The risky equipment isn’t cheap.
"DoD spent more than $30 million purchasing thousands of electronic products vulnerable to cyberattacks that are manufactured by Chinese companies, including one with connections to the communist regime’s military and cyberespionage programs."
So let’s recap: we’re spending tens of millions of YOUR tax dollars on high tech equipment with known cybersecurity risks.
The Pentagon needs to pull the plug on these products.
Using compromised equipment that is vulnerable to cyberattacks just does not compute.
"August Squeal Award: the Pentagon For these reasons, I am awarding my August Squeal Award to the Pentagon for wasting millions of dollars of taxpayer money on computers and other equipment that can be exploited by our adversaries."
And I’m also calling on DoD to assess and mitigate the risk of any such high-risk equipment currently in use and prohibit the purchase of any additional technology with cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
"With the new and evolving threats we face today, we need to stay ahead of the curve with our technology and cyber."
"As the chairman the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, this is an issue I’m especially concerned about."
"When it comes to our nation’s defense and security, let’s make sure our tax dollars are being used in the most productive way possible."
We can’t afford even a dime to go to waste.
Do you have an example of government waste or inefficiencies that I should take a look at?

"Dear Friend,  Its good to be back in Alabama after a wonderful visit to Israel!"
"With continued attacks on Israel from members of Congress and even members of the mainstream media being exposed for anti-Semitic comments, there could hardly have been a better time to personally reinforce our important alliance."
We Must Stand With Israel  Israel means so much to our nation.
The American people have no better friend.
"As the only democracy in the volatile Middle East, Israel is one of our greatest partners on the global stage."
"And Israel, particularly Jerusalem, holds a close personal significance to many Americans of different faiths."
Israel is a very special place to my wife and me.
"Four years ago, Rebecca and I traveled together to the Holy Land in a visit that affected us deeply."
"On this transformational trip, we renewed our baptismal covenant in the River Jordan."
"From the Golan Heights to the site of Solomon’s temple, our travels reinforced our Christian faith."
"Last week, I once again visited Israel."
"My visit coincided with a diplomatic dustup between Israel and two members of the Squad, Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar."
"The Squad’s hatred of Israel, support of the BDS movement, and denial of Israel’s right to exist weighed heavily on the minds of many Israelis who already live in danger."
"With all Israel faces, I respect Israel’s decision to block Tlaib, Omar, and their anti-Israel activism out of the country."
The week brought many moments of poignancy that provided important perspective.
"As part of our tour of the Old City of Jerusalem, we visited the Western Wall, which offered a meaningful opportunity for me to pray for our nation and state."
This was a very special moment for me.
"Looking down upon the City of David from the Temple Mount, one of the holiest spots in the world, it is difficult not to be overwhelmed."
"Being near the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac and walking the Southern Steps, where so many biblical figures traveled, was equally moving."
And it was thrilling to see the Bethesda pool from the fifth chapter of the Gospel of John.
Perhaps the highlight of the week occurred at the Mount of Olives and Gethsemane.
Praying at the site where Jesus prayed to his father before being crucified was a truly amazing experience.
"We met with several American and Israeli officials, including the U.S."
"Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who provided unique insights on Israel’s challenges."
Ambassador Friedman is a true champion of the U.S.-Israeli relationship A highlight of the week was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The opportunity to reinforce in person our two nations’ commitment to one another was of critical importance.
He is a great friend of the United States.
"Speaking with Israeli military officials about Israel’s missile defense programs like Iron Dome, Arrow and David’s Sling made it clear that Israel is in a tough neighborhood."
Adversaries like Iran would wipe them out if the chance arose.
"Israel’s high-tech defense programs are impressive, and I’m proud of U.S. support for these programs."
"Without question, President Trump’s steps to strengthen our alliance with Israel, including the bipartisan action of relocating the American embassy to its rightful location in Jerusalem, are beneficial and long overdue."
Both parties should support actions to strengthen this alliance.
I wish all my colleagues would visit Israel and talk directly with Israelis about the challenges they face.
"Israel is special place, and we must stand firm in our alliance with its people."
Israel remains a crucial American ally in a dangerous world.
"Though anti-Israel sentiments are only held by a minority of Americans, I am increasingly concerned they seem to be finding a sympathetic mouthpiece from the mainstream media."
Anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel cannot be tolerated or go unchallenged.
I promise to continue proudly standing with Israel.
Trump Administration Closes Immigration Loophole   The Trump Administration has moved to get rid of a loophole in immigration law that has allowed illegal immigrants to flood into our country.
‪This was the right and humanitarian thing to do.
"There is much more to be done, but we cannot continue to condone and encourage illegality at our Southern border that fuels the ongoing crisis."

What's Ahead The House recess continues.
I will be traveling throughout Alabama and hope to see many of you before returning to Washington next month.
It remains to be seen what legislation Speaker Pelosi will prioritize once we return.

The Congressional Agricultural Fellowship is a CAES initiative funded by Georgia EMC and the Georgia Agribusiness Council and provides students at UGA an opportunity to learn more about agricultural policy.
"This summer, we were honored to host Ben Parker for a 12-week summer fellowship."
Ben is a junior applied biotechnology major from Perry.
"Ben attended briefings and committee hearings, conducted research and wrote memos on policy issues, and worked closely with our staff to meet the needs of producers across the Eighth District."
"We thank Ben for all his hard work this summer, and we wish him the best as he finishes up his final year at UGA."
"Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney Dear Lindsey, From tackling local issues to fighting for all Americans at the federal level, I am committed to working #ForThePeople and this week I had the opportunity to meet and work with many of you in our fight to make our city and our country safer, cleaner, and more equitable for all."
"*Advocating to #EndGunViolence* [image = I hope you will join me this Sunday, August 25th at the Cafe at Cornell Tech for a coffee meeting with Moms Demand Action to learn more about how we can fight together to end gun violence."
"This conversation is a continuation of the #RecessRally we had last Sunday where activists, community leaders, and gun violence prevention organizations across the country demonstrated to demand action on gun safety."
I was proud to join many of you in Foley Square to demand that the Senate finally pass H.R.
8 to establish universal background checks for all gun purchases.
Gun violence is a uniquely American problem.
Our citizens are more likely to be killed with a firearm compared to those from any other industrialized nation.
"During this Congress alone, I've introduced five gun safety bills to combat this epidemic and save lives."
I won't ever stop fighting.
"Standing Up for the East 10th Street Community* [image = Also on Sunday, I joined with elected officials, business owners, and residents of the East 10th Street Community to demand that the Department of Sanitation finally remove the trucks that have blocked half of the parking on East 10th Street for over a year."
"These trucks not only emit a foul smell, but they also attract rodents and pose serious safety concerns."
I've written a letter to the NYC Department of Sanitation calling for an immediate solution to the gross problem and to finally give the community their street back.
"*Fighting for Public Benefits * [image = From proposals to cut SNAP, Medicaid, and affordable housing to the recent public charge rule, the Trump Administration has launched unprecedented attacks on our nation's most vulnerable communities and has threatened to take away food assistance from 3.1 million Americans who are struggling to put food on the table."
"We must protect the health and welfare of low-income seniors, immigrants, communities of color and other marginalized populations."
"This is why, on Wednesday, I joined with non-profit leaders at the Jacob Riis Settlement in Queens to urge Congress to pass the Working Families Tax Relief Act and the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act."
It is also why I introduced H.R.
"3323, the Nonprofit Relief Act of 2019 to reverse the burdens that the Republican Tax Scam has caused for non-profits so they can carry out their important missions without being penalized by unfair tax gimmicks."
*Snapshots from NY-12* [image = *On Monday I joined elected officials and community leaders from the Upper East Side to cut the ribbon on a new supportive housing unit for women and children.
"I'm so proud that our Upper East Side community has welcomed our new neighbors with open arms, and I hope that we are able to open even more housing units to help the nearly 40,000 NYC families experiencing homelessness."
* [image = *It was so great to join Council Member Ben Kallos and the East Side community late Monday night for the 79th Street power washing!
"From morning until midnight, I remain committed to making my community better and solving problems both big and small."
"* [image = *On Wednesday, I had the unique opportunity to stop by Local Union #3 and tour the Electrical Industry Training Center!"
"Unions are the backbone of our nation, and I loved learning about the important work the dedicated members of the Association of Electrical Contractors do."
"* As always, your concerns still and always will remain my top priority."
Please do not hesitate to email me through my website.
"This week, I penned an op-ed for Sun Community News on the importance of access to quality health care in rural areas like the North Country."
"I have been fortunate to visit with many of the people who work at health centers in my district – Hudson Headwaters, North Country Family Health, and the Community Health Center of North Country – which collectively provide more than 95,000 people in North Country with critical health services."
"Their work as problem-solvers in public health – whether it is bringing needed dental services to children in schools or addressing the opioid epidemic with innovative treatments to break the cycle of addiction – has made a local, life-saving impact."
I’m proud to work across the aisle with my colleagues in Congress to extend critical funding for health centers before it expires on Sept. 30.
"Legislation I introduced, “The Community Health Investment, Modernization and Excellence (CHIME) Act,” has laid the groundwork to stabilize funding for health centers so they can continue to build the workforce, facilities and services to reach more people."
There is bipartisan agreement that a long-term funding extension will not only improve health care for families but also deliver health-care cost savings to American taxpayers.
