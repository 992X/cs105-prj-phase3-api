"No matter what is happening in Washington, I wont lose sight of the issues we face back home."
I was especially lucky to introduce Kathy Zeman to the House Agriculture Committee earlier this week.
Kathy farms in Rice County and she came to Washington to testify in support of the Local Agricultural Markets Program which promotes farmers markets around the country.

"       An update from Congressman Ken Calvert                 About Ken  Issues  Contact Me                   Dear Neighbor,  There is no doubt that Americans, including me, love our pets!"
"We consider them part of the family and in a nation as great as ours, its incumbent on us to find ways to ensure animals are treated with dignity."
That is why I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Humane Cosmetics Act (H.R.
"5141), a bipartisan and bicameral bill to end the safety testing of cosmetics on animals in the United States."
The Humane Cosmetics Act prohibits the sale and transportation of cosmetics developed using animal testing and requires the Food and Drug Administration to publish a strategic plan to develop alternative animal-free testing methods for cosmetics.
"5141 is an important step towards reducing unnecessary animal testing and promoting animal-free testing alternatives that are safer, more cost effective, and are already being adopted by the cosmetics industry."
This bill demonstrates American leadership in fighting animal cruelty while supporting our cosmetics businesses.
"There is no reason to inflict painful, cruel tests to animals when better, more cost effective tests exist to ensure the safety of cosmetic products."
5141 is supported by the Humane Society Legislative Fund and the Personal Care Products Council which represents over 600 cosmetics businesses.
I look forward to partnering with the cosmetics industry and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this important legislation.
"Sincerely,  KEN CALVERTMember of Congress             Join Me On...

"       News from Representative Gus Bilirakis                                                          Friend,  It is often said that, A hero is someone who dedicates his or her life to something bigger than oneself."
"There is no greater example of heroism than those among us, both past and present, who have bravely answered the call to serve our nation."
"We understand that the price of freedom is not free, but rather is paid by the men and women who have and continue to defend our country and the sacred ideals we cherish."
"Some of these heroes never return and others live with wounds, both visible and invisible, that they carry with them throughout their lives."
Their families also pay a high price so that all of us may enjoy the blanket of security that is too often taken for granted.
"Its not enough to recognize their service one day out of the year, but rather we must continuously seek ways to honor their service and sacrifice."
This is what I have tried to do throughout my tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"As we recognize Veterans Day tomorrow, Id like to give a special thank you to everyone who has honorably served our nation."
We owe you a debt that is impossible to repay.
"However, we can be mindful of President Kennedys words, As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them."
I renew my pledge to continue serving as the voice of the Veteran community in Washington and to always ensure that my actions and record of service reflects my heartfelt gratitude for their service.
"Last week, I enjoyed the opportunity to participate in many community events, meet with many stakeholders and learn from our neighbors about the issues that matter most to them."
Continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts during this district work period.
"Honoring Service and Sacrifice  Last week, I once again partnered with the West Pasco Dental Association and Pasco Hernando State College to provide free dental care to Veterans in our community at our Stars, Stripes and Smiles event."
"Through this partnership, local dentists generously volunteer their time and provide free dental care to Veterans in our community."
The Pasco-Hernando State College Dental Assistant/Hygienist students also gain valuable experience with patients.
"I'm working to expand dental care through the VA, because I believe oral health is an essential part of overall wellness."
"In the interim, these dentists are making sure that Veterans in need of immediate help get the care they deserve."
I am very grateful for everyone who helped make this event possible.
I also recently enjoyed the opportunity to salute Vietnam-era Veterans in Land O' Lakes.
"Sadly, these Veterans did not receive the heroes' welcome they deserved when they returned from war."
"On behalf of a grateful nation, I was honored to have the privilege of letting them know how much I appreciate their service and sacrifice."
You can read more about the celebration in this story.
I had the privilege of honoring several of our nation's heroes during the Veterans' Day celebration at Market Street Memory Care Residence in Tarpon Springs.
It was refreshing to listen to their stories and share my gratitude for their service and sacrifice.
"I also had the honor of recognizing one of my constituents, Nick Costidis, for his heroic service to our country."
He fought bravely during WWII and is a Purple Heart recipient.
It was especially nice that his family was able to participate in this special celebration.
This local newsstory highlighted our encounter.
"Additionally, I'm proud that Tampa Bay has just beenranked as the top place in the nation for Veterans to live."
I am confident that we will continue to make this an even more supportive environment for them.
Advocating for Seniors and Medically Fragile Populations  I recently filed bipartisan measure to improve seniors access to audiology services.
"As someone who lives with a significant hearing impairment, I understand the value of receiving proper audiology care, and I want to be sure that everyone who participates in Medicare has access to these critical services."
You can learn more about my legislation here.
I also recently filed important bipartisan legislation to help vulnerable patients.
"Ourbill is about making sure that bureaucratic changes dont jeopardize the health of medically fragile patients who rely on ventilators, such as many living with ALS."
"We want to be sure that these patients, who are already grappling with complex medical issues, dont experience delays accessing care, as lapses could prove fatal."
I will continue to fight to ensure all Medicare patients receive access to the life-saving care they need.
"Saving our Four-Legged Friends  Last week was National Animal Shelter Appreciation Week, and I enjoyed the opportunity to visit a local shelter in Land O' Lakes."
It was a pleasure to meet the staff and volunteers who have helped transform and support Pasco County Animal Services (PCAS).
"Before November 2012, 83% of the animals brought to PCAS were euthanized."
"Many advocates and new leadership fought for a ""Save 90"" policy, and now the PCAS saves over 90% of impounded animals."
They've utilized innovative practices and forged many community partnerships in order to realize this goal.
Animal shelters are vital resources for communities.
"A shelter is a safe haven for animals, and a great place to adopt a new family pet."
"Shelters also provide critical services such as investigating cruelty and neglect, reuniting lost pets with their families, teaching kids to care about animals, and providing spay/neuter services to help reduce pet overpopulation."
"While 63 percent of American households include pets, fewer than 20 percent of them were adopted from shelters."
"National Animal Shelter Appreciation Week is a perfect opportunity for you, your family, and our community to become acquainted with local shelters."
"Together, we can help these four-legged friends find a good home."
Working Together to Get Things Done  Government works best when leaders at all levels work together to meet the needs of the people they serve.
"Last week, I had the privilege of speaking with Dunedin officials about the city's federal legislative priorities."
"Specifically, we discussed the need for affordable flood insurance, cybersecurity concerns and local infrastructure priorities."
I look forward to continuing to work with these local partners to better meet the needs of our mutual constituents.
"Appreciating the Arts  For more than four decades, the Dunedin Fine Arts Center has brought art to the community through studio classes for all ages, contemporary art exhibitions, a childrens hands-on museum, summer art camps, and special events."
"It is truly one of Dunedins hidden treasures, and I enjoyed my visit last week."
"Protecting our Children   I am proud to help ensure local communities receive our fair share of federal funding, and I will keep fighting to ensure every child has a safe learning environment."
Readthis local story to learn more about how I am trying to achieve this moral imperative.
Learning From You  Thank you to everyone who participated in my tele-town hall last week.
"Thousands of constituents listened in, and many people shared their thoughts about issues which matter most to them including:   Support for legislation that helps rare disease patients,  The need for term limits, Opposition to impeachment proceedings and support for President Trump,  The need to denounce anti-Semitic rhetoric,  The importance of getting a permit for the Ridge Road extension project,  Concerns with the VA MISSION Act implementation, The need to expand dental care and improve wait times for Veterans,  Support for protecting the sanctity of life,  The high cost of medication, health, auto, home and flood insurance,  The importance of preserving Social Security and Medicare, and  Problems with the VA, FEMA and other federal agencies I truly appreciate the chance to share information about the work I am doing and believe that understanding your needs and concerns makes me a better representative."
"With several thousand people participating in the call, it wasnt possible for everyone to ask a question or share their ideas."
"If you did not get the chance to speak, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 727-232-2921."
Your input is appreciated.
"Constituent Corner  Last week, a member of my staff received the following email from a constituent who participated in my Stars, Stripes and Smiles event: Thanks to you and your office for the assistance with the Pasco Dental experience."
Please let Gus know I appreciate all his efforts for Veterans.
This broken tooth has been of concern to me over the last couple years and they were able to fix it and clean my teeth.
Takes a load of worry off my shoulders.
This is just one example of the work we do each and every day.
"While we dont hold the Stars, Stripes and Smiles event every week, we do constantly look for ways to help constituents with the problems they are facing."
Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office.
"The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape."
We are here to serve you!
"Community Connection  I am fortunate to have a team of staff that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community."
Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.
My team had the pleasure of participating in the Metropolitan Ministries Blessing of the Tent in Lutz.
This event kicks off the charitable work this organization will be doing in our community to provide assistance to families in need during the holiday season.
A special thank you to everyone who is helping with this worthwhile cause.
My team enjoyed celebrating the Grand Opening of the Elite Soccer Academy International Competitive Development facility in Zephyrhills last week.
It is exciting to see our community to grow.
Welcome to the neighborhood!
It was an absolute honor for my team to participate in the New Port Richey Rotary's annual celebration of Veterans last week.
It is always wonderful to see our community united in support of those heroes who have sacrificed so much to defend our freedom.
My team attended the Thirteenth Judicial Circuits Veterans' Treatment Court Regional Training Workshop.
"During the training, my team had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how some Veterans struggle with service-related mental health and substance use issues."
I was pleased to learn how the 13th Judicial Circuit Veterans' Treatment Court is sharing its experience as a problem-solving court with other jurisdictions throughout the state.
"Programs within the court, such as the mentor program, keep the court on the cutting edge as a rehabilitative body in the criminal justice system."
Im proud that our local advocates are setting the standard for the state and nation when it comes to supporting Veterans.
My team was able to visit the Regency Palms Apartment complex located in New Port Richey.
"During the visit, they discussed recent renovations and the need for additional quality, affordable housing options in our community."
"I will continue to support federal initiatives, such as the Community Development Block grant, that help local communities meet this need for affordable housing."
My team had the privilege to help coordinate the first meeting of the Reentry Coalition of Pasco County.
The group's mission is to help end recidivism.
"The meeting was held at Journey Church in downtown New Port Richey and the focus was on how key stakeholders (mental health and substance use treatment providers, faith based organization, employment services, etc.)"
could improve collaboration and help prior offenders maximize existing resources.
I look forward to this partnership growing as we work to end recidivism.
My team enjoyed participating in last week's North Tampa Bay Chamber business breakfast.
"During the meeting, Colonel Al Carter, Deputy Director of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs (FDVA), spoke about the agency's current functions and new initiatives to better support our nation's heroes."
"Additionally, my team was proud to participate in an event hosted by Other Side of the Dunes, a local non-profit that helps wheelchair bound Veterans obtain vehicles that they can use to navigate sandy terrain, such as at the beach."
"We want to make sure that our most severely injured heroes can enjoy a full life, and this initiative is part of that effort."

"                       Friends,    It's HEALTH WEEK in my office and a good time to remind seniors that the Medicare open enrollment period ends December 7th."
Here are my top 5 tips for selecting a Medicare Advantage Plan: 1.
Consider a plans Star Rating.
This measures how well Medicare Advantage and Part D plans perform based on customer service and quality of care.
"If you rely on any prescription drug, check the drug plan to see if your drugs are on that list."
Make sure the plan covers nearby hospitals and other health care providers you rely on.
Look at the costs as a whole.
"Make sure you consider total drug costs, premiums, deductibles, and other costs to see if it fits in your budget."
"If you have a chronic condition, look at how well the plan manages that condition by reviewing their coverage rules like prior authorization and step therapy."
"Also, a reminder my offices next Medicare tele-town hall will be Wednesday, November 13th at 10:00 a.m. Medicare beneficiaries can speak directly with Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services officials about their Medicare plans and questions."
The call-in phone number will be:Dial-in Number: 877-229-8493PIN: 116489              BUILD Grants coming to Hays Infrastructure is vital to the economic prosperity of so many communities in Kansas.
"From roads to bridges, broadband and water, all systems must function for communities to thrive."
"This week, Ellis County was notified they've received a $6.5 million BUILD grant from the United States Department of Transportation for the reconstruction of four miles of road north of Hays and an extension of the existing US 183 Bypass around the City of Hays."
"Earlier this year, I toured thebusinesses impacted by this investment and saw first-hand the need for improvements in the city's roadways."
"This project received local, state, and federal support and will have a positive impact on Ellis County, Hays, and multiple employers."
"Financial Services Summit Earlier this week, I had the pleasure to be part of a panel discussion on the growth and competitiveness of Kansas over the next decade at the Kansas Financial Services Summit hosted bySecurity Benefit."
I joined Kansas Secretary of Commerce David Toland and Kansas Chamber of Commerce President Alan Cobb to highlight both what is working and what we all can do to improve the future of the state.
"Kansas has so many unique and valuable assets and opportunities and its my job to remove regulatory burdens, keep taxes low, and improve the economic environment to make education and good-paying jobs attainable for all Kansans."
"Animal Health HEALTH WEEK isn't just about human health, Kansas has become a leader in animal health and nutrition, andMerck Animal Healthis one of the many companies working to develop more animal health products for livestock and household pets."
"Merck, located in DeSoto, Kansas, sits in the heart of the Animal Health Corridor and manufactures vaccines for livestock that are used both in the U.S. and in 47 countries around the world."
"Protecting the health of our animals is vital to creating a safe, secure, and affordable food system."
"Fixing Hours of Service Regulations Hours of Service regulations continue to impact livestock haulers across the country, including right here in Kansas."
"These regulations lack the flexibility needed to address the unique challenges posed by transporting agricultural commodities, and are often misunderstood or inconsistently enforced."
"To help our Kansas producers ensure animal health and welfare during transport while also ensuring motorist safety, I recently co-sponsored H.R."
"4919, The Responsible and Efficient Agriculture Destination (TREAD) Act."
"This bill provides for an additional 150 air-mile exemption from these regulations on the back-end of agricultural commodity hauls, and would allow for year-round use of these exemptions."
Its a commonsense step providing the flexibility needed for producers and haulers alike.
President's Award for Distinguished Service I was proud to receive theAmerican College of Cardiologys (ACC) 2019 Presidents Award for Distinguished Public Service.
"ACC represents over 52,000 cardiovascular health care professionals across the country and they advocate on policies that improve patient access to care, promote heart health, and decrease administrative burdens in the health system."
ACC selected me for this award because of my efforts on advocating for innovation and transparency in the health system and my successfully led regulatory initiatives with the Trump Administration.
They also highlighted my contribution in advancing legislation that would streamline prior authorization in the Medicare Advantage program.
Im humbled to receive this award.
"Every health care initiative I take on, I put patients first, and strive to deliver fair and meaningful solutions."
"Improving Rural Infrastructure Last Friday, theU.S."
Department of Agricultureannounced a $1.4 billion investment in projects to build and improve rural electric infrastructure that will benefit 1.5 million residents and businesses across the country.
"Specifically, in the First District,Western Cooperative Electric Assn., Inc.in Wakeeney will receive $19 million to build and improve 135 miles of line that will enhance system resilience and reliability for over 500 customers."
"Additionally,Ark Valley Electric Cooperativein South Hutchinson will receive $5.7 million to build and improve miles of line that support hundreds of Kansans."

"Congressman Dave Joyce, Representing the 14th District of Ohio Friends, This past Friday, I was honored to participate in the opening ceremony for the Cuyahoga Valley National Park's new Boston Mill Visitor Center alongside Senator Portman."
"For the first time in the 45 years Cuyahoga Valley has been part of the National Park System, we have a front door to welcome visitors."
"[image = OH-14 is proud to have a portion of the Buckeye State's only national park, and now with this new visitor center, we can help people better understand the park's resources and encourage them to visit Northeast Ohio and enjoy all it has to offer."
"Learn more about the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, its new visitor center and the opening ceremony here [link 1]."
"Supporting Women in Business* This week, I was proud to vote for the Women's Business Centers Improvements Act [link 2], which would increase access to resources and opportunities for female business owners and entrepreneurs."
"Specifically, this bill would increase funding for the Women's Business Center Program from $18 million to $31.5 million annually."
Women Business Centers operate across the country and provide a full range of technical training services for small businesses primarily owned by women.
There are currently 9.8 million women-owned businesses in the United States and they continue to grow at a faster rate than any other demographic.
"Combined, these businesses employ more than 7.8 million people and generate over $1.4 billion in revenue."
This legislation unanimously passed the House.
"*Providing Life-Saving Tools to Emergency R*esponders Battling the Opioid Crisis* On Wednesday, I joined my colleague Congressman David Trone and the employees of Emergent Biosolutions, which manufactures Narcan and naloxone, to talk about the life-saving resources needed to combat the opioid crisis."
"Last year alone, Ohio EMS providers administered 36,944 doses of naloxone."
That number is more than just a statistic.
"It represents the lives of mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and friends and loved ones whose lives were saved."
"Unfortunately, the process for law enforcement agencies to establish a naloxone program is difficult and time-consuming due to regulatory requirements."
"That's why I cosponsored the HEROES Act [link 3], which ensures state and local agencies will face fewer obstacles in equipping their first responders with naloxone."
"[image = Every time I participate in a discussion like the one Congressman Trone and I had with these workers, I learn more about how we can better battle the opioid crisis and protect our communities from this epidemic."
"Wednesday's important conversation was no exception, and I sincerely thank everyone who participated."
"*Reducing the National Backlog of Sexual Assault Kits* I am pleased to report that earlier this week, I voted for and the House passed the Debbie Smith Act Reauthorization Act of 2019."
"Named after a survivor of sexual violence who eventually found justice through DNA evidence, this important legislation will provide funding for crime labs to process sexual assault kits, require states to create plans for the reduction of the backlog of these kits and help strengthen the national DNA database used to help solve crimes."
"As of July 2019, the FBI DNA database system has produced over 475,803 hits, assisting in more than 465,270 investigations."
"According to the National Institute of Justice, 42% of those hits are a direct result of funding provided by the Debbie Smith Act."
"You can learn more about the bill, which I am a cosponsor of, here [link 4]."
"*Protecting Our Nation's Animals* As a pet owner who considers our golden retriever to be a member of our family and as a member of the Animal Protection Caucus, I was happy to see the House pass the PACT Act this week."
"As a cosponsor of this bill, I applaud my colleagues in recognizing that it's past time for federal animal cruelty legislation."
[image = Any form of of animal abuse or ill-treatment has no place in our society and I look forward to seeing it get signed into law as soon as possible.
"Dave E-mail Updates* *Yes, please periodically send me e-mail updates."

" District Update October 27, 2019Open in browser window                          About Contact Issues Services        Hello Friend,  I wanted to make you aware of the policy work I am doing while in Washington."
"We are working to ensure there are not any cures lost in our drug pricing proposals, working to help combat the youth vaping epidemic, and working to ensure Arizona's trade is continuing to thrive while fighting for passage of the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement."
"Below you will find a review of the work I did while in Washington, D.C. this past week."
"Protecting our Pets   I am proud to have been a co-sponsor of the Protecting Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, or the PACT Act."
This legislation passed the House and will protect animals from inhumane treatment and punish those who choose to exhibit such repulsive acts.
"During my time in Congress I have worked to ensure animals are protected from inhumane treatment, and I am pleased to see this legislation take a previous law one step further to protect our animals."
"Working to Prevent Youth Vaping  This week the Ways and Means Committee held a hearing to discuss legislation focused on taxing vaping products, such as electronic cigarettes, at the same rate as tobacco cigarettes."
"This legislation would not tax the vape itself, but the nicotine."
"After several hours in committee on this legislation, I shared my concerns that only taxing the nicotine is a very limited solution to a much broader problem of youths vaping."
More comprehensive efforts are needed to limit youth vaping and to address the risks of other dangerous drugs being substituted in the place of nicotine in these pods.
"The Wall Street Journal found that ""Majority of Vaping-Related Illnesses Involve THC Products."""
Adding a tax to the nicotine will not prevent other dangerous drugs from being used in vapes.
"I think we should be focusing our policy to help provide resources for teens to learn how avoid these dangerous substances and to quit vaping, instead of adding a tax to these products."
We found this websiteassociated with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Smokefree initiative.
which provides resources for teens looking to quit vaping and stay vape-free.
"We also found a free text-message program, made from input from teens, college students, and young adults who have attempted to, or successfully, quit vaping."
I look forward to continue to work with my colleagues to help combat the youth vaping epidemic.
"To watch the hearing we had in the Ways and Means Committee, click here."
Securing Cross-Border Trade I sent a letter with Members of the Arizona Delegation to the International Trade Commission highlighting the importance of cross-border trade for tomatoes to the economy of Arizona.
Arizonas relationship with neighbor Mexico supports thousands of jobs across the state and is a driver of our economic growth.
I am pleased to see the Arizona delegation stay consistent in working together to protect our cross-border trading relationships and Arizona jobs from harmful trade restrictions The full letter sent to the International Trade Commission can be found here.
We all know that trade largely benefits Arizona.
The Arizona-Mexico Commission put together district specific graphics to show the number of jobs benefited by trade with Canada and Mexico in each Congressional District.
"Passage of the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement is long overdue."
We all know the importance of trade with our neighbors and this agreement will bring to our economy.
"For more information about the benefits passage of the USMCA will bring, click here."
Safeguarding Innovation to Protect Cures   The Ways and Means Committee met this week to make final adjustments to H.R.
"3, Speaker Pelosi's Drug Pricing Plan."
I offered amendments during the markup which seek to improve medication adherence and to examine alternative payment models for disruptive healthcare therapies and innovation.
Republicans on the Committee offered twenty-six bipartisan amendments to ensure H.R.
3 does not create fewer cures or stifle innovation.
None of these bipartisan amendments were adopted by the Committee.
The Government should not be deciding to support some cures for illnesses over others.
The positive health benefits and cost savings for families by curing a disease is extremely powerful.
I urge my colleagues to reconsider working to include the amendments offered by my Republican colleagues and ensure while we are working to lower drug costs we are financing innovative healthcare policy.

"                  ABOUT  SERVICES  LEGISLATION               October 25, 2019    Connect with us                   Dear Lindsey,  Protecting Granite Staters with Preexisting Conditions  On Wednesday, I joined my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues to question the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator, Seema Verma, about the Trump Administrations continued efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act."
"While Democrats have been working to lower health care costs and improve access to quality care, the Trump Administration continues to work to undermine our health care system and take us back to a time when Americans could be charged more or denied coverage because of their medical history."
"More than half of Granite Staters live with a preexisting condition, leaving them vulnerable to this administrations relentless attacks."
I will continue to hold the administration accountable as we work to find solutions to protect those with preexisting conditions and lower health care costs.
Questioning CMS AdministratorSeema Verma.
Drug Take Back Day  Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.

Preventing Future Tragedies and Keeping Our Roads Safe  I was proud to voice my support on Wednesday for the SAFE DRIVERS Act to prevent tragedies like the one we experienced in Randolph this summer when seven members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club lost their lives and three others were injured after a truck collided with their group.
The driver responsible for the accident should never have been behind the wheel that day  the individual still had a license due to a loophole where state DMVs often do not process out-of-state infractions.
This commonsense legislation would help states implement electronic systems to keep dangerous drivers off our roads and keep our communities safe.
Speaking on the Floor about the SAFE DRIVERS Act.
"Securing our elections from foreign interference  As a member of Congress, it is my duty to protect and defend the Constitution and the rights therein."
"As foreign adversaries continue to attack our democratic process, I am proud to support the SHIELD Act to counter foreign interference and protect our national security."
"This legislation would increase campaign finance transparency, crack down on online disinformation campaigns, keep foreign money out of our elections, prevent foreign influence in our elections, and curb voter suppression and intimidation."
It's critical that we act to protect the integrity of our democratic institutions.
Protecting Animals from Cruelty  I was proud the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Actpassed the house unanimously on Tuesday.
"My sons grew up with our beloved cats, Petey and Pel, and this legislation will protect pets like them by making animal cruelty a federal offense."
Im glad that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle agree: cruelty against animals has no place in our society.
Helping Sexual Assault Survivors Move Forward  The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act passed the House on Wednesday with strong support from both Republicans and Democrats.
I was proud to support this legislation because no survivor of sexual assault should be denied justice because their local police department cant afford to test their rape kit.
"The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Actprovides funding to process DNA evidence, put rapists behind bars, and help survivors move forward."
"Now its time forthe Senatetoreauthorize this much-needed, commonsense legislation."
"Here for You  As your Congresswoman, one of my biggest responsibilities is supporting Granite Staters when they need help with federal agencies."
"I was contacted by Charles, a constituentfrom Bow who had an issue of concern regarding the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS)."

"This week, we focused on creating tax incentives for Hurricane Michael victims to ease the current housing crisis in the Panhandle and I broke down the controversy surrounding the recent National Defense Authorization Act in an editorial for the Panama City News Herald."
"Read more below:  Residential Recovery ZonesRecently, I introduced legislation to address the lack of housing in the wake of Hurricane Michael.H.R."
"3790, the Residential Recovery Zone Act, creates new Residential Recovery Zones to incentivize both residential development and home ownership in affected disaster areas."
The Panhandle faced unprecedented losses after Hurricane Michael destroyed or damaged a large percentage of the houses and businesses in its path.
"While we are working hard to rebuild, many Hurricane Michael victims are facing a housing crisis."
These people are having to make tough decisions and some have even moved away because of lack of affordable housing.
"While not a complete solution, this bill will help home buyers and spur investors in disaster areas."
By incentivizing home-buying we can stimulate the local economy and make it clear to all that the Panhandle is open for business.Click here to learn more.

"Political Theater and our National DefenseLast month, Democrats in the House passed a partisan version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)."
For 58 years the NDAA has been a bipartisan bill that focused on providing the necessary resources to our men and women in uniform.

" District Update August 4, 2019Open in browser window                          About Contact Issues Services        Dear Friend,  We had exciting economic news this week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics including record setting labor force participation data and thousands of jobs added to our economy."
I would like to update you on the economic news and some of the work I did in Arizona this past week.
More Jobs  Record Labor Force Participation  Each month of 2019 has shown a positive jobs report and record breaking data proving our U.S. economy remains a strong global leader.
"The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data on Friday showing 164,000 jobs were added into our economy in July, unemployment stayed low at 3.7%, and we reached a record high for labor force participation which hit 163.4 million jobs filled."
"If we want to pay for our promises like Social Security and Medicare, we must continue to grow our economy."
"To read the full jobs report, click here."
I look forward to seeing how we can fill the newly added jobs from this past month to keep our economy on top.
Great Read   The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board released an article this past week that highlighted the new income inequality revisions made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"This update is extremely important, as it showed that wages are going up much faster than we originally thought, and we are also seeing savings rates are on the rise."
"For too long, economists said we could never reach the statistics we are seeing in our current economy."
"However, we have now proven that pro-growth policies work, and we must continue to highlight the success and prosperity of all Americans, not just the 1%, who are experiencing the benefits of a strong economy."
"To read the full article, click the headline above."
Small Business Spotlights   Thank you Foothills Animal Rescue for your work across communities in Arizona to foster animals in need of a home.
"We gave them a Small Business Spotlight award for their commitment to saving animals and for their new location in memory of Brynne Smith, a 25-year old who died in a tragic helicopter accident."
"This organization, started in 1995 as a foster based organization, has built other locations in Arizona to help more Arizonans foster and adopt."
"They have helped other pet rescue locations in Arizona too, including recently helping rescue 9 kittens from a local shelter who had no space."
Their work is inspiring and Olivia and I had a great time learning more about what they do.
"To learn more about how to foster an animal, visit their website here!"

"The Opportunity Zone Lead Remediation Impact Act of 2019:This month, I also introduced the Opportunity Zone Lead Remediation Impact Act of 2019 with Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to eradicate lead poisoning in Census tracks designated as Opportunity Zones."
Opportunity Zones were created as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to provide tax incentives for investment in underserved areas and brought a wonderful chance for many disinvested communities to receive the economic support needed to lift their poorest residents out of poverty and into the middle class.
"However, the program did not provide any guidelines to ensure investments made within Opportunity Zones provided for better health outcomes for their residents."
This legislation changes that and would ensure a positive impact on the overall health of residents by eradicating lead poisoning in Opportunity Zones.

HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!
This week I want to wish all of you a very happy Independence Day!

"    NewsFrom Congressman Ben Cline                    Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline  The halls of the Capitol were supposed to be quiet week before last, during what is commonly known as a District Work Period for Congress."
"Members spend time working in their local offices, meeting with constituents, visiting local businesses, or speaking with community groups about local issues of importance."
Its a great opportunity to reconnect with and report back to the voters who we represent in Washington and who we fight for each and every day.
What we normally don't do during District Work Periods is consider legislation.
Thats because almost no one is there to cast a vote on the bills.
Its understood that the Speaker will not try to push legislation through when a bill's opponents are all back home in their districts.
"Normally, the Speaker shows respect to other Members by waiting for them to return to Washington."
Respect for the institution of Congress and respect for debate is critical for the government envisioned by our founding fathers to function.
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, decided to toss aside the the historic courtesies that have been shown to Members for centuries."
"Without calling Members back to vote, the Democrat leadership tried to pass H.R."
"2157, a spending bill to address several natural disasters that occurred in the past few years."
"While I support efforts to provide assistance to communities who have been impacted by natural disasters, this brazen attempt to ram this bill through without any debate is symptomatic of just how broken Washington has become."
"After several Republicans drove back to Washington to object to efforts to move the bill, it became clear why they didnt want debate about what was in it."
"Amazingly, less than 30 percent of the $19.188 billion package has anything to do with actual disaster assistance."
The rest of the bill was full of pork-barrel spending for pet projects and other non-emergency functions.
Debating the bill also would have given Members the chance to understand that 86 percent of the funding in this bill was not even requested by the Trump Administration.
"Members should have also been aware that the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was funded at $29 billion at the end of April, with projections of $18.2 billion in the fund at the end of the fiscal year."
"2157 eventually did pass by a vote of 354-58, House Democrats failed to identify a way to pay for it without adding to our national debt."
I will continue to vote against wasteful spending and demand fiscal responsibility in Washington in all areas.
"If we can find ways to balance our state budgets and our family budgets, I believe it is time for the federal government to follow suit."
"In other action last week, the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties held a hearing to promote increased access to abortion."
"During the hearing, we heard from witnesses on both sides of the ideological spectrum.Amazing testimony came from Melissa Odhen, who survived an abortion procedure."
"As an adult, Melissa has made it her lifes mission to prevent abortions and stand up for the right to life."
"As a co-sponsor of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, I am grateful to Melissa for sharing her story, and I will continue to advocate for the protection of life."
I also took to the House floor Tuesday to introduce language into H.R.
"6, the DREAM Act, which would have prevented known criminals, gang members, terrorists, and other public safety threats from gaining legal status through this legislation."
The perverse effect of H.R.
6 is that these public safety threats who could be denied a green card will still be free to stay in the country  as if the U.S. is a sanctuary nation.
"I made a motion that would have made it easier for Department of Homeland Security to deny gang members applications by making it an eligibility requirement that an alien not be a gang member, and by explicitly permitting DHS to consider the information found in gang databases."
"It would have ensured that criminals, gang members, and those who are terrorists and other public safety threats are referred for a determination of removal from the United States."
I am disappointed that most Democrats in the House rejected this necessary change to the bill.
"Finally, this week ended with quiet contemplation."
"On June 6, 1944, more than 150,000 allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, in the largest seaborne invasion in history."
"The success of D-Day laid the foundations for the liberation of Western Europe, the defeat of Nazi Germany, and ultimate victory in World War II."
"On Thursday, I participated in a solemn ceremony at the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford commemorating the 75thanniversary of the D-Day invasion."
"I thank all veterans for their service, but I especially want to thank the men of Bedford for their courage and sacrifice on that day 75 years ago."
Twenty-two men from Bedford were killed during the invasion and subsequent fighting.
It was the largest loss of life on a proportional basis of any town in the United States.
Their bravery and sacrifice continue to secure the freedoms we enjoy today.
"                       Newsroom                Friends,  I wanted to take a moment to inform you of necessary preparations for this upcoming hurricane season beginning June 1st."
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates hurricane winds and storm related flooding will cost the U.S. economy $54 billion this year.
The toll on our communities will continue to worsen with each coming season as storms get stronger as a result of rising global temperatures and sea levels caused by surging greenhouse gas emissions.
"Looking back on the devastating effects of Hurricanes Florence and Michael last year, it is imperative we take the necessary precautions to protect our families, homes, businesses and communities."
The following information was compiled with resources from federal agencies and will help you prepare for severe weather in Connecticut.
Be Prepared  Every family should have a plan to respond to an upcoming storm.
I encourage you to use the information below to help you craft your own plan.

"Combating Valley Fever   I am pleased to announce the FORWARD Act, legislation to combat Valley Fever and support research to find a curehas been introduced in the House and Senate."
"Since being in Congress, we have created the Valley Fever Task Force, a caucus to help educate Members of Congress about this orphan fungal disease found in the Southwest."
"Now, we have introduced legislation that helps to combat this disease."
"My colleague Rep. Kevin McCarthy and I have held round tables, met with researchers and scientists, and have learned so much about this disease."
"It is great to see this legislation bring attention to this disease, and to help those infected."
"Every year, our community sees increased rates of Valley Fever."
"This legislation pushes for a breakthrough in research, it also introduces the first blockchain pilot program for collecting data for fungal diseases."
"As scientists are getting closer to a cure for valley fever [soon a vaccination for our pets], I look forward to seeing how the critical resources provided in this legislation will positively impact the southwest."
We are extremely hopeful that a cure is in our near future.

To say that I'm disappointed in the direction of this committee is an understatement.
"I was sent here to get things done, and I feel like my colleagues across the aisle have been chasing a ghost for the last two years."
"During that time, we've suffered from an opioid pandemic."

"*Introducing Legislation to Support Law Enforcement Officers, Improve Mental Health Care* In an effort to improve mental health treatment and support for our nation's law enforcement officers, I recently joined with Rep. Madeleine Dean (PA-04) to introduce H.R."
"2368, the *Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis (STOIC) Act."
"* This bipartisan legislation will reform and expand an existing grant program to better address the mental health and support needs of law enforcement officers, especially as it relates to suicide prevention."
Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities.
"These men and women routinely endure extremely stressful situations, yet the federal government does little to address the consequences of this taxing work."
"This stress can cause high blood pressure and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has resulted in a suicide rate that is 50 percent higher than the national average."
I am proud to work with Congresswoman Dean to fix this wrong and support police officers and their families.
"According to the National Study of Police Suicides, officers are 2.5 times more likely to die from suicides than from homicides."
This sobering statistic means that law enforcement officers are more likely to die from suicide than in the line of duty.
The *STOIC Act* would address this problem by allowing family-services grant program funding to be used to establish suicide prevention programs and support officers suffering stress and mental health issues.
The program would be authorized at $7.5 million annually for Fiscal Years 2020 through 2024.
This legislation has been endorsed by: - Fraternal Order of Police [link 6] - National Sheriff's Association - Major County Sheriffs of America - National Association of Police Organizations [link 7] - American Foundation for Suicide Prevention [link 8] - National District Attorney's Association - Sergeants Benevolent Association [link 9] It is time for us to take care of those who take care of us.
I hope my colleagues in the House will prioritize the mental health of our law enforcement officers by supporting the *STOIC Act.

"9, a bill that would prevent President Donald J. Trump from withdrawing from the Obama Administration's costly Paris Agreement commitments."
I support President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.
"This was an unfair deal that put our country at a disadvantage by giving a free pass to India and China, while forcing unrealistic demands on our national economy."
"As our nation reaches its energy dominance and continues to reduce emissions through innovation, House Democrats want us to put our economic growth, jobs, and security at risk by forcing President Trump to implement the Paris Agreement."
"The U.S. has already seen the largest absolute decline in emissions among all countries since 2000, according to the International Energy Agency."
"Between 2000 and 2014, our nation reduced emissions by more than 18 percent."
"The Paris Agreement would yield the following outcomes by 2035: - An overall average shortfall of nearly 400,000 jobs; - An average manufacturing shortfall of over 200,000 jobs; - A total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four; - An aggregate gross domestic product loss of over $2.5 trillion; and - Increases in household electricity expenditures between 13 percent and 20 percent."

"* [image = *Introducing Legislation to Protect Puppies* I recently joined with my colleagues Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Charlie Crist (FL-13), and Jim McGovern (MA-02) to introduce the *Puppy Protection Act*, which will provide better protection for puppies by improving standards for federally licensed commercial dog breeders."
I have long championed legislation that protects our nation's animals from abuse and neglect.
"By moving toward more humane standards for commercial dog breeders in our country, this bill will promote animal welfare and provide enhanced protections for the puppies throughout our country."
I hope these efforts will improve the lives of our dogs and defend these creatures who cannot defend themselves.
"Too many of our dogs currently suffer from inhumane conditions, but I look forward to working with my colleagues Representatives Fitzpatrick, Crist, and McGovern to provide protections for these animals in the future."
"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates federally licensed commercial dog breeders that sell dogs wholesale to retail pet stores and commercial brokers, or directly to consumers over the Internet under the *Animal Welfare Act."
"* While the *Animal Welfare Act *is meant to ensure dogs in federally licensed facilities are treated humanely, the current regulations fall far short."
"The *Puppy Protection Act* creates stronger standards for veterinary care, housing, breeding practices, and specific standards for socialization and placement of retired breeding dogs."
"The* Puppy Protection Act* will not impact family pets, livestock, or hobbyist breeders."
"""We envision a day when a puppy will never again find her paws and legs trapped in the wire flooring of a stacked cage at a puppy mill."
The *Puppy Protection Act* will strengthen baseline standards of care that must be provided by large commercial dog breeder.
"Thank you to the leadership of Reps. Fitzpatrick, Crist, McGovern, and Reschenthaler for introducing this important bipartisan measure to improve the living conditions of dogs and puppies."
"We will fight to support its passage."""
"- *Sara Amundson, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund* ""The *Puppy Protection Act* will help improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of dogs kept in inhumane conditions by federally licensed commercial breeders."
"Current regulations allow dogs in federally licensed facilities to spend their entire lives in filthy, crowded cages stacked on top of one another with no access to adequate veterinary care or regular exercise."
"We thank Representatives Fitzpatrick, Crist, Reschenthaler, and McGovern for their continued leadership on the *Puppy Protection Act* and call upon USDA to ensure the thorough and proper enforcement of the *Animal Welfare Act*."""
"- *Richard Patch, vice president of federal affairs for the ASPCA* ""AWI thanks Reps. Fitzpatrick, Crist, Reschenthaler, and McGovern for their efforts to update and enhance the requirements for the care of dogs in breeding facilities."
"Such improvements are long overdue for both breeding facilities and all entities regulated under the *Animal Welfare Act* - *Nancy Blaney, Director of Government Affairs at **Animal Welfare Institute* *Thanks to the PA Association of Community Bankers for meeting to discuss ways to work with our local banks to create jobs in our communities."
"* [image = *Introducing Bipartisan Legislation to Allow Servicemembers to Sue for Medical Malpractice* I recently joined with my colleagues Reps. Jackie Speier (D-CA), Richard Hudson (R-NC), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), and Charlie Crist (D-FL), to introduce the *Sergeant First Class Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act* *of* *2019*, which would allow military servicemembers to bring claims against the federal government for instances of medical malpractice unrelated to their military duties."
SFC Stayskal developed terminal lung cancer after being misdiagnosed in a military health facility.
"America's servicemembers and their families make tremendous sacrifices to protect our freedoms, yet we deny them the ability to seek justice for injury or death caused by negligence at military medical facilities."
I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to correct this wrong.
Our troops deserve better.
"For nearly 70 years, servicemembers have not been able to bring claims against military medical providers after being misdiagnosed, mistreated, or subjected to botched surgeries, even though this malpractice occurred in health care settings in which almost all other Americans have that right."
This legislation seeks to fix the Feres Doctrine by allowing servicemembers and their families to sue the military for medical malpractice.
"The Ninth District: On the Cutting Edge of Biological Engineering for Health Care When not in Washington, D.C., voting in the U.S. House of Representatives during March, I was able to visit several sites where exciting research projects are underway."
"Previously, I wrote about some of them at Virginia Tech."
"More recently, I visited a farm site where scientific accomplishments once seemingly from the realm of a futuristic novel promise to make a difference in our daily lives."
"You may remember Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned with an adult cell."
"Dolly was cloned in Scotland in 1996 and died in 2003, and if you ever visit the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, you can see her taxidermied remains."
"The technology that created her continues to be advanced, refined, and put to new uses."
"Some of that work is being done here in Southwest Virginia, thanks to a connection with Dolly: Virginia Tech had a stake in the entity that cloned her."
"While the company that cloned Dolly no longer exists, in the years since she was cloned, related research has continued in our area, with the Blacksburg-based company Revivicor, which spun off from the company that created Dolly, developing technology for cloning and genetically modifying pigs."
"During my visit to the farm where the genetically-modified cloned pigs are kept, which is located in the Ninth District, I saw that the pigs do not look different from any other pig."
"They are treated well, almost like pets."
"Unlike normal pigs, however, they potentially hold new advances in biological engineering for health purposes."
"For example, they potentially offer a new source for organs that can be transplanted to the people in need of them."
"These special pigs organs have similarities to ours that could make them suitable for transplanting, providing a new source of organs for people waiting on them."
"People with diabetes may also stand to benefit from this research, as certain cells from these genetically-modified pigs could be transplanted into a human pancreas to increase insulin production for those who need it."
Cloning genetically-modified pigs offer more than just a new source of organs for transplant.
Scientists are working on ways to use cloned pigs to help people overcome particular food allergies.
The alpha-gal allergy has become more prevalent in the southeastern United States in recent years; one estimate suggests that up to 30 percent of people in the region have it.
"It is spread by Lone Star tick bites, which introduce alpha-gal molecules into the body."
"People who acquire this allergy suffer adverse effects, such as itching, swelling, and anaphylaxis, when eating red meat such as beef, lamb, pork, and venison."
"Essentially any four-legged animals commonly brought to the dinner table become off-limits to a person with the alpha-gal allergy, even if he or she had previously been able to consume them."
It imposes disappointing dietary restrictions on many.
Other deleterious effects impact the health of people with the alpha-gal allergy.
"Exposure to other products that come from mammals, not just food, can trigger allergic reactions."
"As an example, a small percentage of people would be affected by the gelatin sometimes used as an ingredient in medical products, such as capsules."
"Further, there are some indications that the allergy may contribute to heart disease."
Now how do these cloned pigs relate to this problem?
"By splicing genes, eliminating the alpha-gal gene and adding others, researchers can create genetically-modified cloned pigs that do not produce the alpha-gal protein."
"Products derived from them, from food to medications, will not trigger allergic reactions."
"It is exciting to know that this research, which could make a positive difference in the lives of men and women around the world, is being done in our backyard."
The work I discussed in this column is just the tip of the iceberg of potential benefits.
"Of course, as always with new fields of scientific research, propriety and ethics must be taken into consideration."
"The biological engineering sector has a firm foothold in Southwest Virginia, drawing people and investment into our region."
"Just as there is a long way between Dolly the sheep and the progress yielded in these cloned pigs, the successes of this industry in our region may shape our world in new and unlikely ways."

"In Washington, there have been a number of proposals from Democrats that received much attention."
"One proposal that has been in the news lately has been the ""Green New Deal."""
The Green New Deal is an irresponsible proposal that would cost $93 trillion dollars over the next ten years and change much of our way of life.
"To put that cost in perspective, its $600,000 per American family."
"In addition, Democrats introduced Medicare-for-All healthcare legislation this week."
"Make no mistake, this is government-run, single-payer health care."
"Medicare-for-All would cost $32 trillion dollars, end employer-sponsored health care (throwing 500,000 of my constituents off of their healthcare plans), and drastically reduce access to health care in rural communities."
"Its important we work in a bipartisan way in Washington to find solutions to the problems that Americans face, including protecting the environment and addressing rising health care costs."
"However, these proposals would be devastating to the constituents I represent, and I cant support them."
"An update on other recent happenings: In Congress Breaking Down Barriers for Veteran STEM Careers Veterans have given so much to our nation, and its important that we keep the promises made to them."
One way we can help is in the transition from the military to civilian life.
Its not always easy for members of our military to make a switch to a civilian career.
"This week, the House passed the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, legislation to boost veteran career opportunities in the STEM and computer science fields."
"Through educational opportunities, data-driven outreach initiatives, and traineeship programs, this piece of legislation will help to dismantle the current barriers our heroes face upon transitioning into a civilian career."
Closing the Digital Divide I am proud to serve as the Republican Leader on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communication and Technology.
One of my main priorities is closing the digital divide and increasing access to broadband  especially in our rural areas.
"Over the past few years, weve worked in Congress to help provide the tools to provide more Americans with high-speed Internet."
"Last week, a draft Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report showed that actions by the FCC and Congress are working."
"According to the draft report, the number of Americans lacking access to high-speed broadband has fallen by 25%."
The majority of those Americans live in rural areas.
Whats important about these facts is it shows efforts to reduce regulatory burdens and support investment are helping more Americans gain access to high-speed Internet.
"As I represent a number of rural areas, I know it will make a significant difference inside family homes and for businesses on Main Street in rural communities."
Its important we keep this momentum going.
"Protecting Local Radio Our local radio stations in Northwest and West Central Ohio provide us with emergency alerts, important weather updates, and keep us in-the-know on the latest news."
They are integral parts of our communities.
"However, various fee and royalty proposals in Congress have threatened the way that these radio stations are able to operate."
"This week, I cosponsored a bipartisan resolution, the Local Radio Freedom Act, which opposes any fees, taxes, and royalties on broadcasting performances for local radio stations."
The Local Radio Freedom Act recognizes the potential damaging effects of fees and royalties and demonstrates the broad bipartisan support for local radio stations and their listeners across our country.
"Time is Right for Data Privacy Legislation This week, I participated in an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing on data privacy issues."
I talked about how the time is right to pass bipartisan federal privacy legislation.
"My opening statement is below, but you can watch the video of the hearing as well."
"Here's what I said: Last Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee held nearly a dozen hearings discussing privacy and security issues."
"That includes much publicized hearings where we heard from the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter about how those companies collect, safeguard, and use data."
"From those hearings, it was clear that while these companies provide a service that Americans like, consumers arent always clear about what happens with their personal information."
"With the California law slated to take effect at the beginning of next year, time is of the essence."
"In divided government, its not always easy to tackle the tough problems, but I believe the time is right to work together on a federal data privacy solution."
Both consumer groups and business organizations have come on board in calling for a national standard.
"We all agree that consumers should have transparency and accountability, and that we want to ensure that the United States stays the prime location for innovation and technology."
True Blue Award I was honored to receive the True Blue Award this week for my strong record supporting family values -100% on the 2018 Family Resource Council scorecard.
"In a week when the Senate voted down the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, its never been more important to stand up on these issues."
"These are the values of Ohios 5th Congressional District, and Ill continue to back policies that protect life, liberty, and religious freedom."
"Latta receiving the 'True Blue' Award from FRC President Tony Perkins Around the District Tours, Meetings, and Celebrations in Ohios 5th District Over the last few weeks, Ive made a number of stops to talk with people in communities around the district."
"In Mercer County, I had the pleasure of attending the Celina-Mercer Chamber of Commerce annual banquet."
I also attended the Henry County Community Improvement Corporation's annual meeting and reception.
This event serves as an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of those who have made a lasting impact in the area.
"In Lucas County, I toured K-Limited Carrier, a liquid bulk carrying company, where I was able to see their operations up close."
"In addition, I toured the West Suburban Animal Hospital where I was able to see how the 6 vets at the facility - and 22 in their system - help take care of pets and other animals."
"One of my favorite sayings is, If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog."
"Needless to say, I have a soft spot for the men and women that provide treatment for our pets."
FFA Celebration in Wyandot County I attended a celebration of the 91st anniversary of Future Farmers of America at the Wyandot County Ag Leaders Breakfast.
"FFA is a tremendous organization that helps our youth prepare for careers in science, business, and agricultural technology."
"The breakfast was put on by the Ohio FFA chapters from Carey, Mohawk, Riverdale, and Upper Sandusky schools, and it was inspiring to see such great leadership from local FFA chapters in the region."
"Congressional Art Competition Reminder A reminder that the deadline for submission for this year's Congressional Art Competition is on Monday, March 4."
High school students that live or attend school in Ohios Fifth Congressional District are encouraged to submit a piece of art for this years competition.

"More than 650,000 high school students have participated in the competition nationwide since it began in 1982."
"The winning piece will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. for one year, and three honorable mention pieces will be displayed in my district offices."
More information is available here.
"Defending the Most Innocent It was a dark day on Monday in the U.S. Senate as commonsense legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection, was defeated."
The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require that a baby who survives an attempted abortion be provided the exact same health care as a baby born prematurely.
There is no justification for voting against this legislation.
Its the morally right decision to pass this bill.
Its backed by science.
Its supported by nearly four out of every five Americans.
"Instead, 44 Democrats voted against the legislation and supported a position completely outside of the mainstream."
"I thank Democratic Senators Joe Manchin, Doug Jones, and Bob Casey for bucking their party on this important issue  but its disgraceful that they werent joined by more of their colleagues."
"Recently, I authored an op-ed on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the shocking comments made by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on the abortion issue."
This comes after the state of New York passed extreme abortion legislation that would make late-term abortions much easier to obtain.
Vermont is now working legislation that would go even farther.
"As a member of the Pro-Life Caucus, we will continue to call up this legislation in the House until we are given a vote."
I wont stop standing up for the most innocent in our society.
"Protecting 2nd Amendment Rights This week, I voted against H.R."
"1112, bills attempting to roll back Americans Second Amendment rights."
The bills contained numerous problems and would do little to prevent criminals from accessing firearms.
"For instance, providing a gun as a gift to a cousin or an in-law would be illegal under this bill."
"Also, while there was a hunting exception included, its so vague that it may criminalize sportsmen and sportswomen that are simply handing a firearm to their hunting partner."
"Weve previously passed legislation to fix and strengthen the NICS background check system, provide more resources to schools to address gun violence, and reform the mental health system  all steps to enforce the current laws on the books and keep guns out of the hands of criminals."
"The two bills that passed the House this week would not have stopped recent shootings, but they would criminalize the law-abiding gun owners that I represent."
I voted no on both pieces of legislation.
"                               Instagram  Flickr                      DearFriend,  As Congress begins its new session, I want to share some of the highlights from the past year and get your input on what you want to see me working on in 2019."
"Over the past year, weve made progress on strengthening Virginias economy, combatting the opioid epidemic, and supporting our national defense."
Ive shared a partial list of some of the successes of the past year below.
"While Im proud of the progress weve made in the past year, I also recognize were facing some challenging times as a country."
"Im writing you in the midst of a disastrous, pointless government shutdown that has thrown the lives of thousands of Virginians into chaos."
Ive set up a special page on my website with updates on my work to end the shutdown and resources for federal workers and contractors affected by it.
I remain committed to ending this unnecessary shutdown and making sure the workers impacted by it are made whole.
"But right now, I want to hear from you."
What would you like to see me work on in the coming year?

"As I write this, an intransigent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is refusing to bring the measures to the Senate floor for a vote, and the Trump shutdown continues."
The costs of the shutdown are already extending beyond those directly affected and will pose increasing risks to the U.S. economy.
Business confidence may weaken; consumer spending may slow; travel delays are starting to be seen at some airports; mortgage processing is threatened and the broader economy may be slowing.
Reacting to Trumps Border Wall Crisis Speech  I watched President Trumps first address to the nation from the Oval Office and was disappointed to hear the same misleading fearmongering and simplistic commentary.
See my statement on the speechhere.
"Attending Event Honoring GabbyGiffordsand the late Leo Ryan    On Wednesday, I attended the unveiling of a plaque naming the House Democratic Cloakroom in the U.S. Capitol for former Arizona Congresswoman GabrielleGiffordsand the late California Congressman Leo J. Ryan."
"Gabby was in my 2006 Congressional class and I was deeply troubled by the attack on her and her staff in January 2011 from which she is still recovering.Gabbyis an active proponent for sensible gun policy and continues to advance good causesdespite her continuing physicalchallenges.Ryan was a fighter for justice whose 1978 in-person fact-finding mission to the Peoples Temple cult in Johnstown, Guyana, led to his assassination."
"Ryans staffer Jackie Speier was seriously wounded in the incident but is now Congresswoman Speier after succeeding my friend and hero, the late Tom Lantos, in representing part of the Bay Area."
"As Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in unveiling theGiffords-Ryan plaque, We inscribe their names in the halls of Congress as an enduring monument to their legacies of heroism and selflessness."
"Co-Sponsoring Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019  Gun violence prevention is a high priority for the new Majority and I was pleased to join Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Mike Thompson and others on Tuesday in co-sponsoring a major initiative."
The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019(H.R.
"8)would require background checks on all gun sales.GabbyGiffords, as a former member,was on the House floor when the bill was introduced."
"Authorizing the House to Intervene in Appeal of Texas ACA Case  On Tuesday, I voted to authorize the House to intervene in the federal court case out of Texas in which a judge recently declared the Affordable Care Act (ACA) unconstitutional."
The ACA provides affordable health insurance coverage to over 20 million people and ensures that insurers can no longer refuse coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Iwill continue to fight to see that protection preserved.
"Congratulating New City Council Members Greer, Johnson and Currie    I send my congratulations to Southwest Tennessee Community College Administrator Sherman Greer, former Shelby County Assessor Cheyenne Johnson and Whitehaven Community Development OfficerGerreCurrie for their appointments to the Memphis City Council this week."

"Quote of the Week  The shutdown is harming the American people, the business community, and the economy."
The adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.
"                                                           January 8, 2019    Dear Friends,  As we embark on a new year, I thought you might want an update on my legislative accomplishments in the 115th Congress and a look at my priorities for the 116th Congress and the next two years."
"Legislative Update   Congress Passes Bipartisan Anti-Sexual Harassment Legislation    Last month, Congress passed the comprehensive Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, based on my ME TOO Congress Act."
"Members of Congress will now be held personally liable for all forms of harassment, including sexual harassment, and retaliation."
And survivors will no longer be hindered by an obstacle-ridden dispute resolution process that had been stacked in favor of perpetrators and the institution in their pursuit of justice.
Ratifying the ERA  Only One State Away!
"To give women and girls the legal standing needed to fight harassment and discrimination at school, in the workplace, and in the military, we must pass my resolution to remove the deadline and allow for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution."
"With both Nevadas and Illinoiss ratification of the ERA in 2017 and 2018 respectively, we are now just one state shy of achieving gender equality."
Alleviating Airport Noise   Airplane noise has become an ever-increasing concern in our communities due to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)s implementation of the NextGen navigation program.
"The FAA Reauthorization Act, which passed in October 2018, included my provisions to require the FAA to undertake several new studies to research the economic and health impacts of airplane noise and new methods for alleviating airplane noise."
Fighting for Local Fishermen  I introduced H.R.
"2344, the Crab Emergency Disaster Assistance Act, to assist the commercial fishermen and local businesses that were economically devastated by the closure of the Dungeness crab season in 2016 due to a toxic algae bloom."
The bill would provide $117 million in critically-needed disaster relief funds to help these hard-working men and woman stay in business.
"Stopping Incessant Robocalls  Although the FCC Chairman recently demanded that the phone industry adopt a call authentication system to combat illegal caller ID spoofing by next year, much more must be done to address the scourge of robocalls that result in over $350 million lost to phone scams each year."
That is why I introduced H.R.
"5573, the ROBOCOP (Repeated Objectionable Bothering of Consumers on Phones) Act, to require phone companies to provide customers with free tools to block robocalls."
Standing Against Family Separation    I led a delegation of my Democratic colleagues to visit Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration facilities and a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) child shelter in South Texas in June of 2018 to see firsthand the impact of the Trump Administrations cruel zero tolerance policy.
"I also called on DHS and HHS to address my concerns, demanded greater transparency about the treatment of detained families, and demanded that the Administration immediately reunite children who remain separated from their families."
Supporting Our Troops at The Border   I traveled to our southern border at Christmastime to visit troops deployed to Southern California by President Trump one week before the November elections.
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren and I sent a bicameral letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expressing grave concerns over the highly suspicious timing of sending 5,000 active duty military personnel to the region, which was described by the Pentagon as an expensive waste of time and resources, and a morale killer to boot."
We have also questioned the extent of the Department of Defense resources that have been expended on this operation.
"Allowing Our Furry Friends in the GGNRA   In 2017, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area finally dropped its flawed dog management plan, allowing dog owners to walk their pets off-leash as they have for decades."
"Next up, establishing an off-leash dog area in San Mateo County which has none."
"Protecting Students from Sexual Harassment  Violence  Over the past two years, President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have led a campaign to roll back Title IX protections and force survivors of sexual violence in schools and on college campuses back into the shadows."
I have introduced H.R.
"4030, the Title IX Protection Act, which codifies Obama-era Title IX guidance."
I also introduced and H.R.
"6464, the HALT Act, which goes beyond Title IX protections to strengthen prevention and enforcement efforts designed to combat campus sexual violence."
"I also led several letters to Secretary DeVos, the most recent of which urged her to abandon her dangerous proposal and instead meet with a broad range of survivor advocacy organizations to develop meaningful guidance to protect all students."
"Protecting Transgender Servicemembers   President Trump announced his bigoted policy to ban new transgendered servicemembers in July 2017, with it taking effect in early 2018 and leaving many of our current servicemembers in limbo."
"In response to his attack on our brave troops, I introduced a bipartisan bill (H.R."
4041) to protect transgender members of the U.S. military by preventing the Department of Defense (DoD) from removing any currently serving members of the Armed Forces based solely on gender identity.
Ending the Shipping Ban on Alcohol   I introduced the bipartisan USPS Shipping Equity Act to end the Prohibition-era ban against shipping or delivering alcoholic beverages in compliance with the buyers state law.
This bill would give consumers another option besides private shippers  such as UPS and FedEx  and would bring in $50 million of new revenue for our struggling USPS.
Halting Law Enforcement Abuse of Power   about a teenage girl who was raped by two police officers while in their custody exposed a since-closed loophole in New York state law that allowed the officers to argue the sex was consensual.
"That glaring legal technicality still exists in federal law enforcement and in 30 other states, which is why I introduced H.R."
"6568, the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act."
My bill makes it a crime for federal officers to have sexual encounters with anyone in their custody or who is being held under the color of law and provides incentives to the 30 remaining states to pass similar laws.
"Addressing Revenge Porn in the Military   After hearing from numerous servicewomen who were attacked via websites and online groups like Marines United, which obtain and post obscene and abusive pictures, I was appalled to learn that the distribution of intimate photos without ones consent was not clearly defined as illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."
To address this injustice I introduced H.R.
"2050  the PRIVATE Act  which became law in December 2017, and explicitly prohibits the sharing of intimate images without consent."
Constituent Outreach  Town Hall Meetings   Over the last two years I have held 16 town halls throughout the 14th Congressional District.
These meetings are invaluable for me to learn about your concerns and ideas.
"They also inspire me to keep fighting for your rights, protections, and freedoms in Washington, DC."
"Attendance has ranged from approximately 200 to 1,900 attendees  the latter of which was both the largest town hall in my district and one of, if not THE largest in the country."
"I know the last two years have been trying, but your participation and passion has been crucial to our successes in the past Congress."
I urge and encourage you to stay engaged and active.
I will continue to hold town halls in 2019 and look forward to seeing you there.
Mail  Constituent outreach is an essential part of my job.
I am grateful to represent a district filled with passionate people who are willing to share their thoughts on the issues that matter most.
"Over the course of the 115th Congress, my offices logged almost 125,000 letters, e-mails, phone calls, and faxes from constituents."
I personally reviewed these logs and approved and signed every response.
"And I rely on the opinions and insights you share with me when weighing policy and other strategic decisions, so I look forward to hearing more from you in the 116th Congress!"
---  Its my greatest privilege to serve as your Member of Congress and I look forward to continuing that service in the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives.
"Last year ended with a historic Pink Wave with the most women, including the most women of color, elected to serve in Congress."
And I will work with the women and men of the 116th Congress to build on this incredible opportunity to advance progressive policies that benefit all Americans.
"We have more work to do to hold the President and his Administration accountable for their incompetence and corruption, which is why I am introducing legislation to reform our ethics and campaign finance laws and promote greater transparency by requiring every candidate for the Office of President and Vice President to provide tax returns for the last 10 years to the public."
"In my roles on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Armed Services Committee, I will continue to monitor the Russia investigation, make sure our servicemembers and their families have the support they need, and work to weed out waste, fraud, abuse."
"I will also do everything I can to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at the American dream and that we can all give our children a better life by protecting the ACA and those with preexisting conditions, lowering drug prices, increasing access to health care, strengthening our nation's woefully inadequate gun safety laws, creating greater economic opportunities through the improvement of our nations infrastructure, and fixing our broken immigration system."
"Finally, I will continue to champion womens equality, LGBTQ rights, and the rights of the disenfranchised by taking my fight to eliminate harassment and discrimination in Congress to our schools, workplaces, and the military."
That includes pushing for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  this is the year that we will finally declare victory!
"I hope that the new year is filled with happiness, health, and success for you and your loved ones, and our country."
"[cid:image037.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Oklee - Red Lake County Dear Friends, This week, the House of Representatives passed legislation that includes my language to give the State of Minnesota the authority to manage its population of gray wolves in a way that will best suit the needs of Minnesotans."
"My constituents have long expressed the need for local management of gray wolves, and I urge the Senate to act on this quickly."
"On Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue visited my office to discuss issues for the House Agriculture Committee heading into the 116th Congress."
I appreciate the good working relationship I have with Secretary Perdue and I look forward to working with him during the next Congress.
I am continuing to negotiate the farm bill with my colleagues on the conference committee and I believe we are close to finishing our report.
I remain confident we will have a 5-year farm bill enacted by the end of the year.
"Sincerely, [cid:image003.png@01D47DD1.99D818A0] Congressman Collin C. Peterson Minnesota 7th District Manage Our Wolves Act [cid:image038.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] I voted in support of a bill that includes my language to delist gray wolves in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Wyoming."
"This morning, the Manage our Wolves Act passed the House on a bipartisan 196-180 vote and moves across the Capitol for Senate action."
Farmers and ranchers in rural Minnesota need to be able to protect their livestock and pets from predatory gray wolves that are constantly stalking herds across the state.
This scheduled vote followed a letter written by a coalition of 19 agriculture and sportsmen's organizations that urged Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to place my bill on the House floor for a vote before the year's end.
I gave a speech in support of this bill on the House floor.
You can watch video of my speech by clicking here.
"Farm bill I would like to be able to tell you in this newsletter that we have a farm bill conference report drafted and ready for conferees to sign, but we're not quite there yet."
"However, we are finally in striking distance of an agreement."
We have narrowed issues down and I have worked with Chairman Conaway on a House offer that has been presented to the Senate to help us close out remaining issues.
We are still focused on the goal of getting a new farm bill passed before the end of year to bring certainty to our ag producers and rural communities.
Secretary Sonny Perdue [cid:image039.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stopped my office to congratulate me on my reelection after we chatted on election night.
"We discussed the status of the farm bill, the Trump Administration's rulemaking on SNAP waivers, and the agenda for the House Agriculture Committee in the upcoming congress."
I appreciate the good working relationship I have developed with Secretary Perdue since his appointment and look forward to working with him on the issues facing our farmers and rural America.
American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall [cid:image040.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] I spoke with American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall on Friday.
We discussed the ongoing farm bill negotiations and the importance of enacting a 5-year bill by the end of the year.
Zippy and I agree that American producers depend on a 5-year bill to increase certainty for them at this time when environmental and financial stresses have a lot of folks concerned about the future.
"New Flyer [cid:image041.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] This week, representatives of New Flyer visited my office to thank me for my efforts to keep U.S. bus manufacturers competitive."
"I recently joined a letter urging the Department of Transportation to clarify its ""Buy America"" regulations to ensure that manufacturers, like New Flyer's plant in Crookston, can properly project costs, procure parts, and avoid disruptions to transit systems."
I also thanked Wayne Joseph (President of Transit Bus Business - pictured far left) and Paul Smith (Executive Vice President - pictured far right) for their decades of advocacy as they look forward to retirement at the end of the year.
"White Earth Tribal Council [cid:image042.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Raymond Auginaush, Sr., Alan Roy, and Eugene Tibbetts Recently elected members of the White Earth Tribal Council visited with me to discuss the tribe's wild rice cultivation efforts and the farm bill."
White Earth Nation grows and harvests significant amounts of wild rice by hand that is high in protein and dietary fiber.
I look forward to working with White Earth to expand market access for their wild rice.
"Stronger America Through Seafood [cid:image043.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] I am the lead Democrat on the AQUAA Act, a bill which streamlines federal permitting processes for aquaculture facilities in federal waters and creates research and development opportunities to expand domestic markets of American-grown shrimp and fish."

"During farm bill negotiations I have supported the increase of funding for the Beginning Farmers and Rancher Development Program, a program that provides financial and educational resources for young farmers."
We also discussed what the House Agriculture Committee could look like during the 116th Congress.
"I hope to recruit members from the incoming class of representatives that are dedicated to learning the details of federal agriculture policy, so that Congress can effectively serve Americas producers."
"Teamsters [cid:image045.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] This week, I met with representatives of the Teamsters to discuss the issues affecting pensions across the nation."
Congress must work to protect the hard-earned dollars American workers have invested over the years for their retirements.
"I signed onto the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, also known as the Butch Lewis Act in the Senate, so we can keep these funds from insolvency."
"It is time for the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to move legislation that addresses this problem, and I will continue to work with my friends on both sides of the aisle to see this through."
"Additionally, some members of the group were Vietnam War veterans, and I was honored to present them with Vietnam War Commemoration Lapel Pins to recognize their service."
"Beth Ford [cid:image046.jpg@01D47DD2.F9E3B140] Katie Zenk, Beth Ford, Adam Durand Beth Ford, Land O'Lakes new CEO visited my office on Thursday."
She talked about the importance of completing the farm bill for dairy producers in Minnesota as well as the need to make progress on other issues like immigration reform and resolving ongoing trade disputes.
I have worked on a bipartisan basis on each of these issues and will continue to do so to strengthen our rural economy.
"Energy Conservation Improvement Programs [cid:image022.png@01D47DD1.99D818A0] In 1980, the Public Utilities Commission was directed to initiate a pilot program to demonstrate the feasibility of investments in energy efficiency."
"Four decades later, Minnesota has a host of Conservation Improvement Programs, Clean Energy Resource Teams and a statewide Energy Savings Platform for communities."
Minnesota now ranks 8th in the National Energy Efficiency Scorecard.
"Since 2008, the Conservation Improvement Program has saved Minnesotans an estimated $3.5 billion on their energy bills."

"                                                Holding the Federal Government to a Higher Standard   It recently came to my attention that the Food  Drug Administration was contracting with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources, which admitted in a 2016 Congressional investigation that it harvested aborted fetuses from abortion clinics for a low price and then sold their components at more than 500% mark-up."
Selling any sort of human body part for profit is prohibited by federal law.
"We must ensure that our government engages in research that is ethical, and because of this, I led a Congressional inquiry (and was joined by 85 of my colleagues) into the FDAs contract with this company."
I also spoke personally with Health  Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about my concerns that research dollars were being used illegally and that this funding should go to alternative forms of research that advance cures and are life-affirming.
"Im pleased to announce that following my conversation, Secretary Azar publicly stated the FDA would cancel its contract with Advanced Biomedical Resources and HHS would conduct an agency-wide review of all research involving human fetal tissue and will explore alternative options."
"Im thankful HHS is taking steps to make sure its research meets the highest of ethical standards, We need to find cures without devaluing or destroying human life."
"Leveling the Playing Field with Canada, Creating a New NAFTA     This is an important week in Americas trade dealings with its neighbors."
"On Sunday night, Canada agreed to join the United States and Mexico in a deal to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)."
"Mexico previously agreed to a new arrangement with the United States, but Canada had not come to the table until this week."
The United States and Canada have long been friendly trading partners.
"In recent years however, Canada has not been dealing on a level playing field with our country."
"For instance, Canada had imposed a 241 percent tariff on American fluid milk while the U.S. imposed NO tariff on Canadian liquid milk."
"Thankfully, Canada is willing to negotiate this trade imbalance."
Free trade must be fair trade  for the three countries involved in the new agreement.
I have been a vocal advocate for finalizing fair trade deals in an expeditious manner and am pleased with the priority the Trump Administration has given to getting good deals for the American people.
I look forward to studying this agreement further and appreciate the President fighting for American interests across the world stage.
"In this Congress, were still waiting for important federal nominees to be confirmed."
We still have unfilled positions throughout the government and multiple district judges who have yet to be confirmed.
"In fact, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees of the past four Administrations."
"Even Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) stated, Enough is enough."
We need people who are qualified to filled these important positions in our government.
Its time for the Senate to finish confirming these important positions.
"Missouri Task Force 1 Heroes Come Home     Missouri Task Force 1 comes to the aid of a vehicle in Brunswick County, NC, in the wake of Hurricane Florence."
The Boone County Fire Districts Missouri Task Force 1 has returned home after yet another successful operation protecting Americans in the wake of natural disaster.
Task Force 1 got back to Columbia on Saturday after two weeks of searching for and rescuing victims of Hurricane Florence in North Carolina.
"During its mission, the task force rescued and evacuated 394 residents and 33 pets."
"In addition, the teams provided wellness checks on 1,374 residents who remained in their homes and provided assistance to 155 residents."
The teams also performed damage assessments on 381 structures.
I am so proud of their hard work.
How Tax Reform is Working for You The tax reform package passed almost a year ago continues to bear fruit.
AP reports a Kentucky-based home appliances business plans to add 400 jobs as part of a $200 million investment to expand production at its Louisville operation.
"Since May, GE Appliances has announced more than $475 million of investment in products, manufacturing, and distribution."
GE Appliances President and CEO Kevin Nolan said the tax package played a big role in the companys expansion plans.
There is no doubt that tax reform is still providing wonderful benefits for hard-working Americans.
Weekly Dose of Good News Confidence and optimism create success  and Americans are experiencing a sense of confidence not seen in a long time.
"In September, the Conference Boards measurement of Americans confidence reached its highest level in 18 years."
"   News from Representative Lou Barletta                                             September 27, 2018       Helping Communities Prepare for Disaster       Last night, legislation I introduced to reform our nations disaster response and recovery efforts passed the House for the third time."
"The Disaster Recovery Reform Act(), which was included as part of a, passed by a bipartisan vote of 398 to 23."
Protecting our communities from whatever mother nature throws our way is something we can all work across the aisle to accomplish.
I was shocked by the damage in Dauphin County by the storms this summer.
"Last year, eight percent of the U.S. population was affected by at least one disaster  thats 26.4 million Americans."
"In fact, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria became three of our countrys five most expensive hurricanes on record, causing a combined $265 billion in damages."
"This year, weve already seen disaster strike in our own communities, as more than 20 counties in Pennsylvania were devastated by widespread flooding in July and August."
"Pennsylvanias 11th District is no stranger to flooding, but the storms we saw over the summer were truly devastating, destroying homes, memories, and lives."
"And, at this moment, the Carolinas continue to recover from Hurricane Florence, which took the lives of over 40 Americans."
"It could not be clearer: America needs a better system that saves lives and taxpayer dollars by building smarter and stronger before disaster strikes, which is exactly whatDRRAdoes."
"DRRA is a bipartisan bill thatimplements broad reforms at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, increasing the federal emphasis on pre-disaster planning and mitigation, which will reduce the potential for future loss of life and address the rising costs of disasters throughout America.Mitigation can encompass a wide variety of activities, including proactive preparation and planning, elevating or moving structures prone to flooding, and hardening structures to mitigate effects of hurricanes or earthquakes."
Local infrastructure projects like the flood wall in Bloomsburg demonstrate how investment made before disaster strikes is critical to saving lives and taxpayer dollars.
DRRA also includes provisions ranging from ensuring that individuals with disabilities are able to repair or replace accessibility related property to ensuring pets and other animals are taken care of during disasters.
"Since introducing this bill last November, I have worked tirelessly to ensure these critical reforms are signed into law."
"I urge the Senate to follow the Houses lead to protect communities across the country, and send this important legislation to the presidents desk."

"Honoring the Life of Sedgwick County Sheriffs Deputy Robert Kunze Last week, grief struck our hearts as Sedgwick County Sheriffs Deputy Robert Kunze was fatally shot while on duty."
"On Friday, I attended the funeral honoring this dedicated, brave public servant, who saved the lives of at least two innocent bystanders."
"Sheriffs Deupty Kunze had been part of law enforcement for 18 years  six with the Shawnee County Sheriffs Office, and the last 12 years in south central Kansas."
"Sedgwick County Sheriff Jeff Easter shared that Officer Kunze will be remembered for his smile, his contagious laugh and his ability to engage anyone and everyone in a conversation."
Robba and I ask Kansans to join us in praying for Roberts wife and daughter.
"May God comfort them in their time of grief and be a source of strength for them, and may He protect those who put their life on the line every day to keep our communities safe."
"Advocating for USDA Jobs in Kansas  Following the U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) announcement in August that it would move the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) away from Washington, D.C. and closer to stakeholders and qualified staff; this week, I further explained to Ag Secretary Sonny Purdue why Kansas would make an excellent home for both organizations and the men and women who comprise them."
"Kansas is home to a highly-skilled workforce as a result of the states premier universities, research institutions, agricultural companies and industry producer groups."
"The animal health corridor, stretching from Manhattan, Kan. to Columbia, Mo., has the largest concentration of animal health companies in the world."
"As of 2014, 56 percent of worldwide animal health, diagnostics and pet food sales were located within the corridor."
"The concentration of animal health companies and esteemed research institutions will not only complement the research capabilities of NIFA and ERS, but have also fostered a talented workforce that will help meet the personnel needs of USDA."

"Encouraging National Online Privacy Protections On Thursday, I led a group of my Senate colleagues in encouraging U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to include Congress in any blueprint discussions regarding a national data privacy framework."
"It is essential to protect Americans from data misuse while also establishing certainty for businesses to create jobs, innovate and compete domestically and internationally."
The only way to accomplish this goal is to create a national data privacy framework.
"Any proposal that satisfies both the needs of the American consumers and the internet economy should include the input of Congress, as it would require Congressional action to create an enforceable standard nationwide."
"As chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, I am ready to work with the Department of Commerce and my colleagues in Congress to provide Americans with data protections that promote privacy, competition and innovation."

"Meeting with Senior Army Leaders on Environmental Safety On Tuesday in my Washington office, I met with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jordan Gillis, Brigadier General Joy Curriera and other Army leaders to discuss environmental safety at both Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth and the ongoing remediation of the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant site in Johnson County."
I had previously questioned Army Secretary Mark Esper regarding the long-term clean-up efforts of the Sunflower site and this meeting was a productive discussion to help make certain progress remains on schedule for future land development.
"In addition to the Sunflower site, I also sought assurances that the Army is taking the necessary steps to protect the health and well-being of military families and children assigned to installations in Kansas."
"Spending Time at the Boys and Girls Club of Lawrence  I visited with the Boys and Girls Club of Lawrence and toured their new facility, the Don and Beverly Gardner Center for Great Futures, which opened to club members earlier this month."
"During my visit with staff and board members, we discussed their efforts to serve area youth by promoting academic success, good character, citizenship and healthy lifestyles."
"We also discussed the organizations close partnership with the Lawrence school district, and their advantageous co-location with the Peaslee Technical Training Center and the districts Lawrence College and Career Center."

Addressing the Beloit Lions Club I visited the Beloit Lions Club for its meeting at North Central Technical College.
I appreciate the Beloit Lions Club for allowing me to meet with the group and helping me make up one of my many Lions Club meeting absences from my home club in Hays.
Our local communities are well-served by the support of Lions Club members.

"Discussing Healthcare at Kansas Hospitals Newton Medical Center In Newton, I toured Newton Medical Center, a 103-bed facility that serves the residents of Harvey County and the surrounding area."
"On our tour, I visited with a number of healthcare providers to talk about current issues in healthcare and the challenges they face every day in caring for Kansans."
"I appreciate being able to visit these professionals in their facilities, where I can see the impact that a number of decisions we make in Washington have on their work."
"On the tour, I was pleased to visit different areas of the facility including the emergency department, the wound and hyperbaric center and the lab."

"Smith County Memorial Hospital I visited Smith County Memorial Hospital, just over a month after the grand opening of its new facility."
"I enjoyed touring the new, state-of the art hospital and hearing from healthcare providers, hospital leadership and community stakeholders."
Rural healthcare facilities face many challenges as they work to provide care for those in our state.
I appreciated hearing firsthand from these individuals about how I can assist them as they continue to serve Kansans in a way that benefits both patients and providers.
"Thank you to Smith County Memorial Hospital CEO Allen Van Driel for leading our tour and to various hospital and community leaders for joining us, including; Smith Center Economic Development Director Stacy Schulte, Smith County Commissioner Art Befort, Smith Center Chamber of Commerce Member Lori Bortz, Smith County Memorial Hospital Board of Trustees Member Bret Strine, QUALICB Board Member  GPHA Board Member John Terrill, and Smith Center Economic Development Board Member Kaden Roush."

"Friends, The last few weeks have brought more good news about promises kept to the American people."
"First, new Census Data just released shows that in 2017, the median household income reached an all-time high."
"I believe that when things are good for middle-class families, theyre good for America."
"Were still seeing our economy growing, but the fact that incomes and wages are rising is a positive sign."
"In addition, a recent survey of small business owners found optimism at an all-time high."
"Small businesses are responsible for creating 2 out of every 3 new jobs so when they are raising wages, growing their businesses, and investing in equipment, its helpful to the entire economy."
Another big piece of news was that the United States has passed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the worlds largest producer of oil thanks to the pro-energy policies that have been put in place.
"When we produce our own energy, it means lower costs for Ohioans, a stronger economy, and keeping more of our dollars at home."
Energy independence also means a safer United States as we dont have to rely on Middle East Countries or Russia to meet our energy needs.
"An update on recent happenings: In Congress Freezing Congressional Pay Last week, I helped pass legislation that maintains a Congressional pay freeze that has been in place since 2010."
"Many people dont realize it, but under current law, Members of Congress receive a raise unless they specifically vote to freeze their own pay."
I have long been critical of this policy.
"If Members of Congress want a raise, they should have to vote for it and explain why to their constituents."
Ive authored legislation to put an end to the automatic pay increase.
"However, without my legislation being signed into law, Congress has to vote to freeze pay every year."
Thats why I voted to pass the Conference Report for H.R.
5895 to guarantee no raise this year for Congress.
The Bill also included a 10% reduction for House budgets that has been in place since 2010.
"Increasing Resources for the VA Included in the appropriations legislation I just mentioned were provisions to increase resources for the VA, military construction, and energy and water infrastructure."
"For example, $1.75 billion will go to implementing programs under the recently passed VA MISSION Act -- important legislation that will expand health care access for veterans in Ohio and around the country."
The appropriations bill also expands Congressional Fellowships for the wounded veterans on Capitol Hill.
"It also funds mental health services, suicide prevention outreach, opioid abuse prevention, and rural health initiatives for our nations veterans."
The bill now heads to the Presidents desk to be signed into law.
"Questioning Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I recently questioned CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, at a committee hearing about the social media platform."
Twitter has recently come under fire for allegations of censoring conservative points of view.
I asked Mr. Dorsey about the twitter verification process and how they ensure that they dont highlight one political view over another.
Dorsey answered that they have halted the blue check mark process because of too many faults in the program.

"Improving Student Loan Counseling, Increasing Information Available to Borrowers Students often take out loans of tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands, in order to graduate from college."
"Currently, more than $1.4 trillion of student debt is held by Americans."
Most students are signing up for these loans as young adults and making decisions that can impact their financial well-being for years to come.
I voted to pass the Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act which would enhance counseling for recipients of Federal financial aid.
"While financial counseling is required for students when they receive a student loan, more than 40% cannot recall receiving it."
The bill would require annual loan counseling and would tailor the counseling to the borrowers individual situation.
"That includes making sure all available grant, work-study, and scholarship assistance options are exhausted before additional loans would be taken out."
"This legislation will help ensure financial counseling is more informative, so students can fully understand the financial implications of the student loans they are receiving and learn of alternatives that can help them pay for college."
Care Packages for Spouses of Deployed Military Members I spent some time recently helping the USO on Capitol Hill assemble care packages for the spouses of deployed military members.
"When there is a deployment, it affects entire families, and we thank military spouses for their sacrifice."
The USO does tremendous work to support our troops -- and their families -- and I was glad I was able to join them to lend a hand in putting together these care packages.
"Friend of Pets Award Pets are an integral part of our families, and theyre some of the best friends we can have."
Thats why I was honored to receive the Friend of Pets award recently at an Animal Health Institute event.
While I was there I met some good dogs like Max and Kirby (pictured at the bottom).
Kirby is training to be a hero dog - a service dog for veterans.
It was also great to chat with Brent Weinmann of Wood Countys Vitrakraft Sun Seed.
"Out and About in Hicksville I made a few stops in Hicksville in Defiance County recently including speaking at the Hicksville Rotary about the booming economy, tax cuts, and efforts to combat the opioid crisis."
I also presented a flag in honor of Community Memorial Hospital to CEO Michelle Waggoner in honor of the hospital's 65th anniversary.
"Fairs, Fair, Fairs Nothing says Northwest Ohio like fair season, and I always appreciate being able to get to fairs in Ohio's 5th District."
"Its a great opportunity to talk to people, see the exhibits, and maybe enjoy a milkshake (or two)."
"Just in the past couple of weeks Ive made it to the Williams, Van Wert, Fulton, Hancock, Hardin, and Wyandot County Fairs to name a few."
"At the Williams County Fair, Marcia and I enjoyed seeing the 4H 100th anniversary displays."
"On that note, congratulations to our nephew, Amos Sloan, for his 4H Grand Champion Steer he showed at the Williams County Fair."
Hancock County Farm Bureau ATV Tour I participated recently in the Hancock County Farm Bureau ATV Tour - a great event to help the public learn about the ag industry.
Part of the tour discussed the impact of Precision Agriculture.
"Ive authored legislation to expand access to rural broadband so more farmers can use this technology that is safer, more efficient, and good for the environment."
The tour ended with lunch back at the Legacy Coop in McComb where I discussed some of my efforts to support agriculture.
"Thank you to our farmers for all you do to feed Ohio, the U.S., and the world."
Latta-authored Clean Water Provisions Clear the House Provisions I authored to help public water systems improve infrastructure and ensure safer drinking water were approved by the House last week.
The policies were included in the Water Resource Development Act (WRDA) which passed by voice vote.
"The provisions would:  Provide increased flexibility for the repayment of federal loans for states and local communities that use the funds to finance clean drinking water infrastructure projects  Cut burdensome red tape by removing duplicative reporting and paperwork requirements when state standards are equally stringent  or more so  than federal standards  Help disadvantaged communities better finance their infrastructure through the use of federal funding There are more than 51,000 community water systems across the country, all with varying needs and infrastructure currently in place."
The inclusion of these clean drinking water provisions in WRDA will help communities  including disadvantaged ones  fix and improve their water infrastructure without burdening ratepayers with skyrocketing costs.
"By removing duplicative federal requirements and providing more flexibility to repay Federal loans, states and local governments will be better able to fund clean drinking water projects that meet their specific needs."
Latta recognized as a Hero of Main Street I was honored to be recognized recently as a Hero of Main Street by the National Retail Federation (NRF) for my support of policies important to millions of small businesses in retail.
"More than 98 percent of all retail companies employ fewer than 50 people, and I have a 100% record on the NRF scorecard."
"That includes voting to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has resulted in small business confidence reaching all-time highs."
"In addition, I supported the Small Business Health Fairness Act to allow small businesses to band together to purchase health insurance plans for their employees."
The retail industry is uniquely made up of small businesses that provide employment for tens of millions of Americans.
Supporting policies that allow these businesses to grow means more jobs and higher wages for workers.
"Were seeing small business confidence at an all-time high, GDP growth at 4.2% last quarter, and unemployment matching the lowest rate in nearly 50 years because of these pro-growth policies."
"Retail is the nations largest private-sector employer, supporting one in four U.S. jobs  42 million working Americans."
"                                    GOP Prepares Another Multi-Trillion Dollar Tax Cut For the Rich - Targets Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to Pay the Bill    These seniors have a clear message for GOP leaders planning a $3 trillion tax cut for millionaires, billionaires and wealthy multinational corporations, paid for with cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
"Dear Friend,  Last week, GOP leaders released a plan to balloon the federal deficit to catastrophic new heights in order to provide millionaires, billionaires and multinational corporations with a massive new tax cut."
"According to the well-respected Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the measure would cost some $3 trillion over the coming decade."
"And make no mistake  Republicans have made clear all along that Social Security and Medicare, along with Medicaid, will be put on the chopping block to pay the bill."
"Instead of putting a stop to endless wars of choice projected to cost nearly$16 trillion over the coming years, the GOP will attempt to finance their tax cuts for the wealthy by privatizing Social Security and Medicare, robbing benefits Americans have earned and paid into from their very first day on the job."
"Simply put, Republican leaders have done the math."
"They are targeting Social Security and Medicare because these absolutely critical funds, which belong solely to the American people, account for about a quarter of the governments $4.1 trillion annual budget."
"The deficits caused by last years GOP tax cut, which gave 80% of tax relief to the richest one-percent of Americans and left the middle class with a tiny fraction of the remainder, are already unsustainable."
"According to the independent Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the government spent $895 billion more than it took in over the past 11 months."
Heres the bottom line.
"Billionaires and rich multinational corporations do not need another massive Republican tax cut that would add trillions of dollars to an already unsustainable deficit and be paid for by raiding Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."
Its time for real tax reform that targets the middle class and requires the rich to pay their fair share.
That must be our goal going forward.
We will keep you posted as events proceed.
"Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts."
Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email.
"Sincerely,     Ignoring Hurricane Season, President ""Reprogrammed"" $37.8 Million from FEMA and the Coast Guard to Build More Immigrant Family Jails   Men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard risk their lives every day to serve and protect others - but the President cut their funding by $28 million to build more immigrant child detention facilities on our southern border."
"Unable to generate legitimate Congressional support to fund more immigrant child detention centers on the southern border, the President decided to reach through the back door and grab $9.8 million in cash from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  the department in charge of hurricane relief."
And to add insult to injury he pulled another $28 million out of the budget for the U.S. Coast Guard.
"With Hurricane Florence bearing down on the East Coast last week and millions of Americans at risk, reports surfaced that the President had reprogrammed $9.8 million dollars Congress had appropriated for FEMA, and used it to put more immigrant children and families behind bars."
"To be clear, it is Congress  not the President  in charge of appropriating money for federal agencies."
"Accordingly, I have asked Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney for a full explanation and justification for the Presidents action."
"In fact, the $9.8 million taken from FEMA is only the tip of the iceberg."
"All in all, the Presidents raid on programs and services vital to the American people totaled $169 million  including $28 million in funds for the U.S. Coast Guard  presumably sent to the border to build more jails."
"From the Great Lakes to the hurricane ravaged East Coast, the brave men and women of the Coast Guard are risking their lives every day to save and protect others  and the Presidents response is to cut their funding by $28 million."
That is ashameful and outrageous act by their Commander and Chief.
"Another Record Year for the Port of  Duluth-Superior   The Port of Duluth-Superior enjoyed another record year in 2017, handling some 35 million tons of cargo arriving and departing on laker ships like the Mesabi Miner."
Hats off to the Port of Duluth-Superior and the Duluth-Superior Seaway Port Authority for another record year contributing to the economic success of our entire region.
"According to a report just released by the Authority, the Port last year:   Generated $1.4 billion in economic activity."
"Supported 7,881 good paying jobs and $504 million in wages."
"Handled 35 million tons of cargo  including iron ore, coal, limestone, salt, cement, grain, steel wind turbines and heavy machinery  moving in and out."
Paid nearly $240 million in taxes.
"The Port of Duluth-Superior anchors the westernmost point of the entire 2,340-mile Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway system that connects Minnesotas mines, businesses, manufacturers, farmers and timber producers with the global marketplace."
"It's Time to Restore Our Democracy - And End Voter Suppression   Billboards like this one, typically placed in neighborhoods with large minority populations, are intended to intimidate legal voters into staying home."
"Democracy works best when people participate, so our Restore Democracy legislation calls for an end to voter suppression efforts that discourage, threaten or intimidate legal voters from casting their ballots."
"The simple fact is that despite protections provided by the Voting Rights Act and other federal legislation, some states continue to find ways to make voting difficult if not impossible  especially forseniors and people of color who may be perceived to favor one political party over another."
For example:   Georgia recently passed an Exact Match law requiring that every tiny bit of information on a voters registration application match exactly with data stored with the Department of Motor Vehicles.
"If not, the registration is placed in a pending file and the voter may be turned away."
"Reuters news service obtained a copy of the Georgia Pending File and discovered that black voters were on the list at far higher rates than white voters, even though a majority of Georgia voters are white."
"In Tennessee, a 93-year-old woman was denied her right to vote because she did not have a photo ID as required by law  even though she presented four other forms of identification, including her birth certificate."
"In Ohio, a World War II Veteran was denied his right to vote because his newly issued photo ID from the Veterans Affairs Administration (VA) did not display his current address."
"In Wisconsin, an elderly woman who had voted in the same polling place for decades was denied her right to vote because she had lost her drivers license  even though she presented her old drivers license and proof of residency."
"The Restore Democracy Revolution  The foundation lies in overturning the U.S. Supreme Courts Citizens United decision, which has allowed corporations and wealthy special interests to spend unlimited amounts of secret dark money to influence elections ."
"In addition to stopping voter suppression, our legislation would also put Congress on record supportingsmall donor-public campaign financing and limiting the campaign season."
"Moreover, we are calling for full disclosure of all campaign contributions and establishment of national online voter registration."
We also call for a return to Congresss traditional process of Regular Order.
"Under Regular Order, we find common ground and bipartisan solutions by fully considering every idea and amendment under an open rule  and affording each one an up or down vote."
"Thats how Congress has fixed things, solved problems and gotten things done for more than 250 years."
Its time to get back to that tried and true method of serving the American people.
"GRANT WATCH: $3.5 Million in Infrastructure, Safety, and Housing Grants for Minnesota's  8th District  Under our watch, Minnesotas 8th District has received more than $1.2 billion in federal grants for projects that create good paying jobs and make life better for people."
We were pleased to announce two more important grants for Minnesota's 8th district last week.
"The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a total of nearly $3.5 million in grant funding for new safety equipment and infrastructure projects at theFalls International-Einarson Field Airport,Little Falls/Morrison County-Lindbergh Field Airport,Princeton Municipal Airport, and the Bemidji Regional Airport."
"Specifically, funding will be used to acquire snow removal equipment, reconstruct runway 13/31, and rehabilitate the apron at Falls International-Eniarson Field; construct runway 18/36 at Little Falls/Morrison County-Lindbergh Field; reconstruct runway 15/33, reconstruct lighting on runway 15/33, reconstruct taxiway (A), reconstruct lighting on taxiway (A) at Princeton Municipal Airport; acquire aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicle, rehabilitate the apron, rehabilitate runway 13/31, and rehabilitate the taxiway at Bemidji Regional Airport."
"Housing and Urban Development (HUD) - via the Housing Trust Fund Program (HTF) - announced that the City of Duluth will receive a total of $127,522 in Community Development Planning (CDP) grants for developers to preserve, rehabilitate and construct housing, primarily for extremely low-income families."
"The funding will creategood paying local jobs, benefiting Minnesotas 8th district residents and economy."
"To help keep you updated, we will be using the Monday Report to highlight important federal grants for the 8th District."

"In this picture, members of the Walker Area Joint Fire Department raise the flag."
Nolan Congressional Field Representative Tiffany Stenglein attended the ceremony.
In Case You Missed It: Congress is Going to the Dogs - and that's a Good Thing   The 10th Annual Cutest Pets on Capitol Hill Contest announced this years winners.
"Our Legislative Assistant Eddie Wykind entered his two-and-a-half-year-old female Dachshund dog, Winnie."
"Winnie loves long strolls in the park, lounging on the couch at home, and eating left overs when no one is looking."
"Although Winnie did not win this year's competition, she did make the semi-finals."
"Winnie said, ""I was so grateful fur the paw-some op-paw-tunity and although I didn't win I made a lot of fur-ends."""

Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins *H.R.
"3635, the Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act:* This week, the House Ways and Means Committee marked up and passed my bill H.R.3635, the Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act."
This legislation will improve the coverage determination process followed by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) making Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs).
MACs play a critical role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to much-needed care.
"However, the process used by MACs in making coverage decisions to limit or deny patients' access to care is conducted behind closed doors, with little opportunity for interested stakeholders to raise issues or offer alternatives."
"As a result of this flawed process, I have introduced H.R."
3635 to increase transparency and accountability by improving the LCD process to ensure that medical evidence is not used selectively to deny appropriate coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.
"The bill has the support of dozens of physicians group, including the College of American Pathologists, and I look forward to further House action on the bill."
You can view my remarks in support of H.R.
*Meeting with Oncology Nursing Society:* It was great to have Kansans from the Oncology Nursing Society to hear how I can best help their patient care continue to improve and modernize.
"I was glad to have supported H.R.930, the Lymphedema Treatment Act, which increases Medicare coverage of lymphedema compression treatments."
"Thank you to Yvonne, Lori, and Brandi for sharing other important legislation and taking the time to meet with me!"
[image = *Pet Industry Joint Advisory:* Thank you to our Kansas representatives from the Pet Industry Joint Advisory for your helpful insight on legislation that will promote animal welfare and environmental responsibility.

"Summer Recess Update KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS As the summer season winds down, Im headed back to Washington this week for legislative work after a great recess back at home."
"During August, I had the chance to speak at the Oregon Coastal Caucus Economic Summit on some of the biggest issues impacting our coastal communities."
"I was honored to join this conversation to talk with David Gomberg, our State Representative, at the summit and thank the Oregon Legislative Coastal Caucus for having me, and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians for hosting."
"I shared the work Ive been doing in Congress to combat wildfires in the west, including passing my bill to fix wildfire funding and end the cycle of fire-borrowing."
"My bill, which passed out of Congress and became law this year, will help lift the financial burden of fires from the US Forest Service."
"It will help free up their budget so they can focus on preserving the health, diversity, and productivity of our forests."
I also talked about the dire need to save our salmon along the Columbia River.
"The presence of a small number of sea lions, who have ventured outside their natural territory, now pose an existential threat to a number of our salmon and steelhead populations."
"My Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, which passed the House this summer with overwhelming bipartisan support and the support of the entire Pacific Northwest delegation, has been one of my top priorities in Congress as salmon are one of Oregons most iconic species."
I also had the opportunity this summer to visit the WestCare Veterans' Homeless Shelter in Salem as well as the Veterans Village in Clackamas County.
"Its a shameful truth that in the United States of America more than 58,000 of our veterans remain homeless on any given night."
"WestCares facility provides 30 beds to homeless veterans in our community each night, as well as life-skills training, substance abuse recovery, and reintegration programs."
And the Veterans Village is an innovative housing project that provides a shelter-first approach to ensure that proper services can be provided to vets in need.
"While I work to make changes in Congress to ensure that our veterans are getting the care they deserve, the efforts of both of these facilities are absolutely critical."
"WORKING FOR OREGON Weve seen some lifesaving drugs become astronomically expensive in recent years, sometimes overnight and often with zero explanation."
Working on solutions to bring down drug costs has been a top priority of mine.
Im very pleased to announce the first success as a result of my bipartisan legislation to lower drug costs that became law last year.
"This summer, the Food and Drug Administration announced the first generic drugs to receive a Competitive Generic Therapy (CGT) designation  a classification established under my bipartisan bill  which allows generics with few to no alternatives to come to market faster."
"The drugs to receive the CGT designation include several strengths of potassium chloride oral solution  used to treat hypokalemia, or low potassium blood levels, in patients who are on diuretics  that currently do not have generic versions available."
We know that having generic versions of medication on the market stimulates competition and keeps the cost of drugs down for everyone.
"Thanks to the new CGT status folks suffering from low potassium blood levels will now have more treatment options available to them, keeping a check on the market and preventing unaccountable price hikes to these drugs from occurring."
This is a prime example of the direct impact Congress can have when we work together on solutions to the problems our constituents face back at home.
"This summer, I met with the wife of a veteran who is 100% service connected disabled and retired from the US Army."
"Currently, the Department of Defense is allowed to withhold a veterans retirement pay in cases where they had previously received Voluntary Separation Incentive payments meant to incentivize early retirement, even if the veteran had been involuntarily recalled and sustained a service related disability during their recall duty."
"During this Congress, I introduced a bill called the Recalled Veterans Protection Act (RVPA), to create protections for service members who have been injured after being involuntarily called back to service to ensure they are able to receive their due retirement pay."
In July we successfully added my legislation to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act  an annual package of bills.
I wont stop fighting for this legislation for our veterans and their families to ensure that we keep our promise to our brave men and women.
You also may have read in the news last month about a Vancouver veteran named Jacob McGreevey who lost his home while on his third of four tours of duty.
"Servicemen and women, like McGreevey, have earned certain basic benefits like knowing that their families and their homes are taken care of while they are overseas."
"Last year, I introduced the bipartisan Halting of Mortgage Exploitation of Servicemembers (HOMES) Act to protect our fighting men and women from exploitation by unscrupulous lenders while they put their lives on the line in service to our country."
"Right now, the law doesnt do enough to protect our service members while they serve their country and work to protect us  so lets change it!"
"IN CASE YOU MISSED IT This summer, I called on the Department of Education to issue formal guidance prohibiting the use of federal education funding to buy guns for teachers and school staff."
"Schools should be safe, welcoming, and conducive to quality learning for students and staff."
Arming teachers with federally funded guns would go against Congressional intent for federal education funding and would also go against precedent.
"Not to mention, it could jeopardized the health, safety, and wellbeing of our students."
Read my letter to the Department of Education.
I was pleased to see another of my bipartisan bills signed into law this summer.
"My bill, a reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA), continues agreements between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the animal drug industry to pay user fees that help speed the approval of new drugs for farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians so they can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy."
"As a legislator I am very attuned to all the innovations that are occurring in the human health sphere, and as a veterinarian I want to ensure that our four-footed friends also have access to the latest and greatest medical innovations."
"We worked hard to expand conditional approval in this legislation to animal drugs for major uses and major species, an expansion which is so vital to the veterinary profession."
"Conditional approval is not a free ride for companies, but rather allows us to do the best for our pets and livestock."
"This law will continue to allow and encourage innovation across the industry, benefiting owners, veterinarians, and, of course, the animals themselves."
"I joined KATU on Your Voice, Your Vote to talk about the current wildfire season and solutions I'm working on in Congress."

"As residents of a coastal state, citizens of South Carolina should put time and effort into being prepared for hurricanes and tropical storms."
"The safety and security of all South Carolinians is of the highest importance to me, and please know that the office is always willing to lend a hand."
Below are a few things to keep in mind when planning for extreme weather.
I urge all South Carolinians to take precautions during this hurricane season and to seek additional information and resources so that you and your family will be safe if a storm hits our state.
"Before a Storm, remember these T.I.P.S:   Terms."
"A watch is a notification for residents to be on alert of a potential storm, and a warning indicates that a hurricane is expected in your area."
Review theSouth Carolina Hurricane Guidefor more information.
InsuranceandImportantinformation.
"Review your insurance plans and have copies of important documents, such as drivers licenses, medical information, and insurance cards."
"Plan ahead.Create a family planin the event that an evacuation is necessary, and keep emergency contact information handy."
Dont forget toconsider your petswhen planning for a possible evacuation.
"Plan ahead of time bycreating emergency kitsfilled with survival necessities such as bottled water, non-perishable snacks, medication, batteries, blankets, crank radios and flashlights."
During a Storm:   Listen.Listen to local radio and television broadcasts for current conditions and recommended actions.
You can also sign up to receive emergency alerts on your mobile devicehere.
"Evacuate.When directed by local authorities, you may be required to evacuate."

"Dear Friend, At the beginning of this week, Nevada lost a great public servant whose career spanned four decades - Paul Laxalt."
"Paul was a friend and a mentor, and he epitomized the very best Nevada had to offer by putting service above self."
He served confidante to numerous Nevadans as his wealth of knowledge steered many of us to seek his valued advice and insight.
"His down-to-earth, kind demeanor was befitting of his campaign slogan of choice, One of Us."
Paul was a son of Nevada and indeed one of us.
My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Paul as we mourn his passing.
"This week, I traveled throughout Nevada and my week began at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno with Google, local businesses, and job seekers at a Grow with Google event."
"This free, one-day event was designed to help small businesses, students, educators, and entrepreneurs strengthen their digital skills."
I believe that theres no better place for a Grow with Google event than Nevada - a state that went from having one of the worst unemployment rates during the recession to now being one of the fastest growing states in the nation.
Nevadas economic success is no accident - our state has created an environment that is friendly to businesses.
"We have diversified the industries coming into Nevada, and we have provided opportunities for companies to quickly establish facilities and start hiring."
"Ill continue to do everything that I can in Washington, D.C. to capitalize on Nevadas economic success and support our small businesses and entrepreneurs."
"On Tuesday, I was honored to host the 22nd annual bipartisan Tahoe Summit at Sand Harbor State Park in Incline Village."
"Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, delivered the keynote address, and several members of the Nevada and California delegations, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Rep Mark Amodei (NV-02), participated in the Tahoe Summit."
"Much of this years summit focused on wildfire prevention and my bipartisan Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, legislation that was crafted to protect the Lake Tahoe Region by improving water clarity, reducing wildfire threats, jumpstarting innovative transportation and infrastructure projects, and combating invasive species."
"Last week, I was proud to announce announce that I secured $12 million in federal funding to implement his Lake Tahoe Restoration Act in a spending measure approved by the U.S. Senate."
"Furthermore, as we did last year, well continue to make sure that organizations - like AlertTahoe  and others, are able to use new and emerging technologies to detect wildfire will be eligible for federal funding so they have the resources they need to get the job done."
"Just recentl, I announced that the U.S. Forest Service has allocated $226,000 to AlertTahoe to install and maintain new fire cameras in the Tahoe basin."
"After the Tahoe Summit, I traveled down south and attended the 16th anniversary celebration of the Nevada State Veterans Home in Boulder City, Nevada."
"Ive worked for years with the Department of Veterans Affairs to secure federal funding for the State Veterans Home, and Ill continue to press the agency for adequate resources to complete construction on the Northern Nevada Veterans Home located in Sparks, Nevada."
"PHOTO The next day, I was back in Boulder City with local officials, the Nevada Department of Transportation, the Southern Nevada Regional Transportation Commission, and hundreds of Nevadans at the grand opening ceremony for the Boulder City Bypass, a 15-mile segment of Interstate-11."
I-11 has been a priority of mine for years.
"In 2015, I introduced legislation to extend I-11 from Las Vegas to Northern Nevada, and I secured this extension and designation of I-11 as a high-priority corridor of the National Highway System in the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, the first long-term highway bill in a nearly a decade to be approved by Congress and signed into law."
This bypass is expected to save commuters 30 minutes when traveling between Henderson and the Hoover Dam.
"Looking forward, we need to match Nevadas growth by ensuring our roads, bridges, and infrastructure can keep pace with new and increased demands, that is why I am going to keep fighting to ensure that Nevada has the resources and funds to complete this project all the way up to northern Nevada."
"On Friday, I was back in Reno and visited Noahs Animal House, a full-service pet shelter to assist animals from homes experiencing domestic violence."
"I will always stand up for survivors of domestic violence, and find ways to help prevent future victims."
"In both Reno and Las Vegas, Noahs Animal House is doing incredible work by allowing victims to bring their pets with them to a shelter."
This facility empowers survivors and its why Im going to continue to work with my colleagues to pass my PAWS Act into law so domestic abuse victims in Nevada do not have to choose between their pets and their own safety.
"As always, its an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate."

"Since its founding on July 30, 1953, the SBA has connected small businesses with access to funding, mentoring, counseling, and when disaster strikes, support to recover and get back to business."
"In New Jersey, the SBA set a record of $869 million SBA guaranteed loans last year, and is on pace to approve $900 million in SBA loan guarantees in the Garden State this year."
"These loan approvals have helped create and retain more than 13,000 jobs locally."

"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk *Important news from this past week:* - Congratulations to Marsha Blackburn on winning her primary last week."
"I look forward to working with her in the United States Senate to continue our Republican majority and deliver conservative results for the American people - including lower taxes, fewer regulations and conservative judges."
- Congratulations to Bill Lee on his primary victory.
"As I've often said, there is no better job than being governor of your home state, especially if that state is Tennessee."
I look forward to working with Bill to continue Governor Haslam's excellent leadership of our state.
"- President Trump signed into law a bill I helped write and pass--with the support of Ivanka Trump--that will help the 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs learn the skills they need to find good jobs."
The need for skilled workers is the issue I hear most from employers in Tennessee.
"- Millions of Americans who are between jobs and who pay for their own insurance will welcome an extended option for lower-cost, short-term, renewable policies that the Trump Administration provided last week."
*Republican Congress Getting Results for Tennesseans:* - Legislation to give our troops at Ft. Campbell a pay raise is headed to the president's desk.
"The bill, which authorizes $716 billion for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, also supports important programs at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge to strengthen our national security."
"- The Senate passed legislation to help fund five Land and Water Conservation Fund projects in Tennessee - three National Park Service projects in Tennessee national parks; one U.S. Forest Service project in the Cherokee National Forest; and one Forest Legacy project, the Skinner Mountain Forest."
"The bill will also begin to reduce the maintenance backlog at our national parks - helping restore campgrounds, trails, and roads - as I work with my colleagues to pass the Restore our Parks Act, which would do more to restore national parks, including the Smokies, than anything that has happened in the last half century."
"- The Senate unanimously passed my legislation [link 1] to help bring new animal drugs to Tennessee farmers and ranchers, families, and veterinarians to keep our pets healthy, prevent outbreaks of disease, and protect our food supply."
"*Delivering a boost to career and technical education in Tennessee* [image = I was at the White House last week with President Trump as he signed into law legislation I helped pass to fund the programs that train skilled workers -- for example, a Tennessee high school student wanting to become a computer coder, or an adult going back to school to learn about commercial construction."
"At a time when our economy is booming, what I hear most often from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers and this new law delivers a boost to more than 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs and help put them on the path towards the middle class."
I'm grateful to Ivanka Trump for her work on this bill.
*Reducing health care costs: focusing on administrative burden * The Senate health committee I chair continues its work into reducing health care costs.
"Last week, I chaired a hearing on reducing the cost of administrative tasks - which include everything from the time doctors and nurses spend filling out insurance claims to buying software for an electronic health records system."
"I talked about Dr. Reid Blackwelder, a Kingsport family physician who chairs a residency program with three clinics in Tri-Cities."
"Dr. Blackwelder is required to have an electronic health records system because he sees Medicare and Medicaid patients, but unfortunately, electronic health records systems have ended up being something physicians too often dread, rather than a tool that's useful."
Dr. Blackwelder still can't see a patient's records from the hospital he can see out his office window.
"[image = Last week, I had a great time visiting Maryville College, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary next year."
"My parents met there in the fall of 1931, so I brought along a few pictures of them to share."
Thank you to President Tom Bogart for giving me a tour of their old stomping grounds.
*President Trump's zero tariffs goal is exactly the right policy * [image = [link 2] It's time to do what President Trump said last week -- zero tariffs is exactly the right policy.
That's what we did with the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"Over 15 years, we worked to reach nearly zero tariffs on many products, and now it's time to get rid of the steel and aluminum tariffs which are driving up the cost of cars and hurting the 136,000 Tennesseans who work in the automotive industry."

"*Working to fill potholes, maintain trails and campgrounds, repair visitors' centers at the Smokies and other national parks* [image = I joined Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Wednesday to build support for the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act [link 5] to help address the nearly $12 billion in deferred maintenance at our national parks--that means filling potholes, fixing bathrooms, maintaining trails and campgrounds, repairing visitors' centers and restoring our 417 national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, so Americans can enjoy them."
This legislation could cut in half the deferred maintenance backlog in our parks over the next five years.
"The good news is that Republicans and Democrats who often disagree are in near unanimous agreement to fix our national parks, and we agree that it should happen this year."
Click here [link 6] to see more about when Sec.
Zinke and I looked at deferred maintenance needs in the Smokies.
*Supporting Tennessee agriculture and expanding rural broadband* The Senate approved legislation last week that will help support Tennessee's agriculture industry and rural communities.
"This legislation is good news for Tennessee's farmers because it funds the Farm Service Agency, Department of Agriculture Rural Development programs, and agricultural research at Tennessee universities."
"It also includes $30 million to help expand broadband to rural communities *Below are some articles from last week I thought you would enjoy:* The Washington Examiner: Sen.

"Before the fun begins, I just wanted to relay to you a few tipsfrom the office of Wisconsin Emergency Management on how to keep safe this 4th:  Last year, 15 people were hospitalized and 102 visited emergency rooms in Wisconsin due to fireworks-related injuries, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services."
"Nationally, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says more than 250 people go to emergency rooms with fireworks-related injuries every day during the weeks leading up to the July 4th celebration."
The easy way to keep everyone safe is by watching free community fireworks shows.
"However, if you choose to set off your own fireworks, please follow these tips:    Make sure you buy legal fireworks that are allowed in your community and buy from reliable sellers   Never allow children to play with or ignite fireworks."
Adults igniting the fireworks should always wear eye protection and never have any part of their body over a firework.

Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter.
Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.
Hosting Townhall Meetings in Jefferson and Stafford Counties I continued my Kansas Listening Tour this week.
"In McLouth, I was pleased to share that the VA MISSION Act recently became law, making it easier and more efficient for all veterans, especially in rural Kansas, to receive the care they deserve."
"We also discussed the Farm Bill, how we must responsibility negotiate global trade deals, talks with North Korea and rural broadband and its importance to small communities like those in Jefferson County."
"In St. John, we discussed several items including the upcoming Farm Bill; trade agreements and tariffs; the importance of healthcare and keeping our critical access hospitals alive; rural technology and communication, as well as broadband expansion; education, especially the importance of career and technical education; as well as immigration, where I stressed the need for Congress to come together and work on things we agree on in this realm, including finding a permanent DACA solution, maintaining high-skilled and agricultural visa programs, and preventing the separation of families at the border."
"I also paid homage to Carl Dudrey, a longtime friend and St. John community leader who passed away earlier this year."
Thank you to Stafford County Economic Development Director Carolyn Dunn for arranging my visit to St. John.
Thanks also to USD 350 Superintendent Josh Meyer and to State Senator Mary Jo Taylor for attending.
"Moving Forward with CJS Subcommittee Appropriations Bill My Senate Appropriations Committee colleagues and I are actively moving through the appropriations process for our federal government agencies, and on Thursday, the Appropriations Committee voted to advance the FY2019 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act."
"As chairman of this subcommittee, I am pleased our bill passed the full committee."
"I am grateful for the partnership of Senator Shaheen (D-N.H.), the ranking member, in crafting this legislation, which prioritizes issues important to Kansans and Americans across the country, including funding for the STOP School Violence Act, EDA Regional Innovation Programs, NASA and more."
"The Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act of 2018, signed into law earlier this year, will help schools train security officers with crisis intervention strategies, strengthen school infrastructure and develop anonymous reporting systems to help intervene in crisis situations before students can harm themselves or others."
The Economic Development Administrations (EDA) objective is to foster economic growth in low-income areas with high unemployment based on the specific needs of local businesses.
"Over the last decade, communities across Kansas have received more than $30 million in assistance to help create an improved Kansas economy."
"This bill also includes funding for NASA and its many different programs, including support for NASAs unmanned aerial vehicle research and advanced composites materials for aircraft, of which Kansas State, Kansas and Wichita State Universities are active research partners."
"Our bill also prioritizes NASAs Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Opportunities program to encourage and develop students who are studying these important fields."
"Now that the FY2019 CJS appropriations bill has been approved by the committee, it must be voted on by the full Senate."
I am hopeful the Senate will continue our process toward passing all appropriations bills prior to the end of the current fiscal year on September 30.
"Advancing Kansan Michelle Bowman's Nomination As a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, I voted on Tuesday to advance Kansan Michelle Miki Bowmans nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board."
Miki wasnominated by the presidentto serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in April to hold the seat specifically reserved for one member with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks.
I look forward to supporting her nomination on the Senate floor.
"On Monday, I spoke on the Senate floor in support of her nomination."
Watch my full remarkshere.
"Meeting with Students from KU TRIO Talent Search I met with students from Kansas City, Kansas representing the KU TRIO Talent Search program in my D.C. office on Tuesday."
They detailed the importance of TRIO to their academic success and shared their plans for what awaits them following their high school and eventual college graduations  including aspirations to come back to Kansas and serve their communities.
"TRIO programs provide educational opportunities for young people, including first-generation college students, Americans with disabilities, low-income individuals and veterans."
I support these programs to make a difference for many students in Kansas and across the country.
"Meeting with General Anderson I had the opportunity to meet U.S. Army Lieutenant General Anderson, a senior Army staff leader overseeing operations, plans and training."
LTG Anderson recently visited both Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley and welcomed his impressions of both communities and the vital role they play in the Armys future.
I was pleased with LTG Andersons transparency and his commitment to thoughtfully and diligently addressing areas of concern in the stationing process.
"Vietnam Veterans Memorial Moving Wall Closing Ceremony On Sunday, I joined the Wamego community for the closing ceremony of The Wall that Heals.This wall is a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Wall in Washington, D.C. and features the names of over 58,000 service members who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending our freedoms in the Vietnam War.Since its creation, the wall has traveled to over 600 communities across our nation, providing the memorials healing legacy to many.Ive had the distinct honor of serving in many different capacities that have allowed me to meet so many veterans across our state."
"Whether it has been greeting veterans on Honor Flights and welcoming them to our nations capital, meeting with veterans and active duty servicemembers in my office, or visiting with thousands of veterans across the state during my travels, I have been privileged to hear the unique and compelling story of our servicemembers."
Thanks to Caterpillar Wamego Operations and the Wamego Area Chamber for their efforts in getting The Wall that Heals to Kansas so we could have the opportunity to admire it and pay our respects to those who serve our nation.
"Attending FHSU President's Dinner On Friday evening, I attended Fort Hays State University President Dr. Tisa Masons first annual Presidents Gala."
This gala is a part of the universitys current Journey campaign to help support students and faculty.
"FHSU is a rapidly growing institution that serves many Kansans, and I was honored to be at this event along with over 250 fellow supporters of the school, many of them whom Ive had the chance to call friends for a number of years."
"Participating in Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony On Friday while in Hays, I attended a Hays Chamber of Commerce ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the new Post Rock Pet Boarding facility, which will offer dog and cat boarding and pet grooming."
Congratulations to Post Rock Pet Boarding co-owners Kylie Sander and Dr. Heather Holliman-Pope on this accomplishment and on your great facility.
Thank you for your quality service to the Hays community and its pets.
"Remembering Ruth Browne On Saturday, I attended memorial services for Ruth Browne in Clay Center."
Judge Brown served on my Service Academy Selection Board and I enjoyed reconnecting with her during selection time every year.
"I enjoyed often attending Fourth of July parties she co-hosted in Clay Center, and especially as we approach the holiday, Robbas and my prayers are with her family and friends."
"Now Accepting 2018 Service Academy Applications As students are finishing up the school and beginning their summer breaks, I want to remind them of the opportunity to apply to a United States Service Academy."
"Appointing Kansans to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.; the U.S."
"Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md."
"; the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo; and the U.S."
"Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. is one of my favorite duties as a U.S."
"To review requirements and move through the application process, please download an application from mywebsiteor contact my Olathe office at 913-393-0711."

"News from Representative Marshall Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  Click here to forward this email       Friends, This week I called on my colleagues to deliver a comprehensive solution to our nation's immigration system."
We must end the sluggish pace at which we are addressing border security and immigration in Congress.
I also am working very hard behind the scenes to repair our trade deals.
I met with both the Mexican and Cuban Ambassadors this week to continue to advocate for new and better trade relationships.
As both self-imposed and retaliatory tariffs continue to weigh on our producers and manufacturers I want you to know I am working tirelessly on trade.
"Our President has promised to deliver new and better agreements, I will continue my work to ensure we achieve those."
"In other news, today we saw a touching story out of Salina, Kansas where a WWII vet's family was reunited with their fallen soldier's wartime memorabilia after more than 70 years."
I'm so proud of my staff that worked hard to track down the family.
"_____  Kansas sees *pet*ential in this growing industry  I recently visited the Simmons Pet Food factory in Emporia and quickly learned how Kansas is not just a leading provider of food for Americans, but for domesticated animals as well."
"Simmons Feed Ingredients boasts an innovative array of proprietary animal nutrition products, serving customers in all 50 states and more than 40 countries around the world."
The reason I visit great companies such as Simmons Pet Food is because of the value they bring to our Kansas communities.
Being the home to not just one but three leaders in the pet food manufacturing industry means reliable jobs for families in the area.
"Simmons employees more than 600 people, and recently announced $38 million expansion to the Emporia facility."
"We discussed the negative impact the steel and aluminum tariffs are having on their business, as their pet food is distributed in cans made of these materials."
"I have called for the Commerce Department to target bad actors in their steel efforts, not allies who supply steel and aluminum that Kansas manufacturers so desperately need."
Kansans do the best job of telling their stories.
That's why it is always a pleasure to have folks in D.C. that take the time to come by our office.
This week attendees of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association Young Cattlemen's Conference spoke on several key issues that we have partnered on to support our state's beef industry.
"Stability in trade markets, livestock transportation regulations that take consider animal welfare and the 2018 Farm Bill were items that topped their list."
I'm proud to have been a vocal supporter of each of these.
"Kansas' First District leads the nation in cattle sales each year, demonstrating the importance of this industry to our state's economy."
"Small Business Committee looks at barriers for veteran-owned businesses In recent years the VA has adopted rules and policies that increase barriers for veteran-owned small businesses, adding additional requirements that can delay or prevent these small business owners from contracting with the VA. On Thursday, the Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations discussed the senseless road blocks imposed on our nation's veterans."
"I appreciate the Committee taking a look at such an important issue, and I look forward to continuing discussions as to how best help our veterans transition back to civilian life."
"KS, AR, MN lead trade talks with Cuba Ambassador  I joined Senator John Boozman, Representatives Rick Crawford, Tom Emmer, and the Cuban Ambassador to the United States Jos Cabaas, this week in a roundtable discussing the benefits of opening markets between Cuba and the United States."
The panel mainly focused on strengthening agricultural trade between the two countries.
Improving our relationship with Cuba could lead to a stronger agricultural economy in our country.
With farmers concerned about access to international markets a $2 billion potential market remains largely untouched just over the horizon in Cuba.
I took time to emphasize the importance of opening more markets to export wheat and other commodities from our state and nation.
Our Kansas farmers need access to opportunities to increase commodity prices.
"Because of Cuba's proximity, U.S. wheat, corn, sorghum and other exports to the island have a solid advantage over competitors both in shipping costs and delivery times."
"If the U.S. was able to sell its goods to Cuba, Kansas could top $55 million in new sales, with a 25 percent increase in wheat sales."
Earlier this week I took to the House floor to address our broken immigration system.
It is imperative that immigration reform provides a work visa for guest workers so that our state can continue to be an agricultural powerhouse.
"Working with former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Bob Goodlatte, such a program was developed and introduced in the Ag Act which I am proud to cosponsor."
"The program would replace the outdated, seasonal-only, H-2A visas with new H-2C's for our dairy and feedlot industries."
H-2C's are much more efficient and are particularly important for our state's livestock industry.
"Later in the week we met as a Republican conference to further discuss an immigration bill, which would PRE-fund border security, so as to avoid repeating past mistakes."
"Which members are still negotiating the details, we agreed that the remaining policies should closely follow the ""four pillars"" laid out by President Trump in his State of the Union speech."
"These pillars include; securing the border, legal status for children brought here by their parents at a young age, the ending of the visa lottery, and limits to chain migration."
The brokenness of our immigration system and border security is on full display.
"Last month the Department of Homeland Security apprehended 50,000 people crossing illegally."
I am looking forward to what we expect will be several votes on immigration in the House and keeping my promises to the people of the first district.
"This reform is crucial to our economy, our security, and our future!"
"Click the thumbnail above to seems floor speech WWII Veteran finds dog tags of Fallen Beloit soldier  Military veterans and their stories are a topic particularly close to my heart, which is why a recent story that has taken root in our district regarding a Kansas-born WWII war hero is so touching."
"In February, our office fielded a call from a friend of 1st Lieutenant James Garberg, a WWII vet from Minneapolis, Minn."
"While going through his war time memorabilia Mr. Garberg found the dog tags of one of his soldiers, Ernest Childers Jr. from Beloit, Kan. Mr. Garberg and Mr. Childers, Jr. were part of the 32nd infantry regiment that retook Attu Island back from the Japanese in 1943."
Lt. Garberg had carried him from the battleground after he suffered injuries that he later died from.
"When Lt. Garberg's friend, Lt Col."
"Mike DePuglio, contacted the office for help with finding Childers' next of kin or any living descendants to return the tags to, we were glad to help."
"After a search, our caseworker found the fallen soldier's nephew who was overwhelmed with emotions by the news of his uncle's Lieutenant finding and returning the dog tags."
"Today at 12:30 pm in our Salina District Office, Ernest Childers accepted the dog tags, marking the first time these tags have been in the possession of a member of the Childers family in over 70 years."
What an incredible honor it is to have witnessed this story unfold firsthand over the course of this week!
"Kansas Opportunity Zones  On the House floor this week I discussed one specific aspect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  Federal Opportunity Zones, which are designed to promote economic development and job creation in communities throughout our country."
The Treasury Department recently selected 29 opportunity zones in 17 different counties across the 1st District of Kansas.
"When a tract is deemed an opportunity zone, it allows taxpayers to defer capital gains tax if they invest in prioritized local projects."
This is a win-win scenario for both businesses and communities that will spur growth and expansion.
Click on the thumbnail to watch my address on the House floor.
"  Dear Friend, Happy almost summer!"
"I hope you enjoyed the long Memorial Day weekend with friends and family, and took some time to honor the men and women who have lost their lives in defense of our nation."
I had the opportunity to honor World War II veteran Norm Knappman as he participated in the Howell Memorial Day Parade  to pay tribute to his fallen comrades.
His spirit and dedication to our nation really made the parade special.
I also want to extend my congratulations to all of our 2018 graduates!
I've had the opportunity to meet with many of these students  and graduating seniors  over the last few weeks.
We have an impressive bunch here in Michigan's 8th District.
"Good luck to all, and have a great summer!"

"Last week, I voted in favor of H.R."
"5515, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019."
"The NDAA takes vital steps towards restoring our military readiness by modernizing equipment, increasing support for training in each of the Services, and making critical investments in missile defense and nuclear deterrence."
"Further, the legislation provides a pay raise for our troops, the largest in 9 years."
I'm also pleased the bill included my amendment urging North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries to meet or exceed the 2 percent gross domestic product commitment to spending on defense.
"American troops are the greatest force for good around the world, but our allies must step up and participate in the cost of their own defense."
"Heading to the President's Desk  Earlier this month, the bipartisan VA MISSION Act passed the House to ensure our veterans have access to timely and high-quality care."
"For too long, the VA hasn't been living up to its mission to support and care for our veterans."
This important legislation now heads to the President's desk and is a great step towards refocusing the VA on this solemn duty.
"Signed into Law  Last week, the House passed Right to Try legislation, and yesterday President Trump signed the bill into law."
I was proud to support this legislation to provide terminally ill patients access to potentially life-saving experimental treatments.
"If there's a chance to save the life of a child or loved one, I believe they deserve the Right to Try."
"Great Lakes Week  Earlier this month I introduced a bipartisan resolution, H.Res."
"868  , designating the week of Memorial Day as ""Great Lakes Week""."
"As a father and lifelong Michigander, I want my children to enjoy the great outdoors like I did growing up."
"We all know that ensuring the health of our lakes for future generations requires vigilance, and ""Great Lakes Week"" is an opportunity to celebrate our lakes and promote responsible conservation with friends and family members to protect our treasured natural resources."
Combating the Opioid Epidemic  Rep. Bishop's Livingston County roundtable conversation on combating the opioid epidemic.
"Critical gaps in the international mail system are currently being exploited by drug traffickersallowing dangerous synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, to be shipped across our borders through the United States Postal Service (USPS)."
"Currently, private carriers like FedEx and UPS are required to collect advance electronic data on packages coming into our country, but no such requirement exists for the USPS."
"That's why I introduced legislation, the Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act of 2018  , to require the USPS to obtain advance electronic data on inbound shipments and transmit that data to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), allowing CBP to target for opioid shipments."
"While there's much more we canand should doto turn the tide on the opioid epidemic, working to keep this poison from ever coming into our communities is an important step."
"Fighting Animal Cruelty and Government Waste at the USDA Earlier this month, I sent a letter  to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue expressing concerns and seeking more information about experiments on cats and kittens being performed at a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland."
"In the USDA testing that has been receiving taxpayers' dollars for nearly half-a-century, hundreds of kittens are bred, fed parasite-infected raw meat, and then killed, even though the USDA admits the kittens are healthy at the study's completion."
The USDA responded to my letter and we now know that the USDA has spent more than $22 million on these experiments.
"While I support scientific research, I do not believe the USDA should be spending tax dollars to unnecessarily kill cats in cruel, outdated experiments."
That's why I introduced bipartisan legislation  with Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) to end the use of cats in experiments that cause pain or stress.
"Good Policy As a recap, here are some of the latest bills I've co-sponsored: H.Res."
"785  - Expressing support for continued cooperation between Israel and the United States to ensure adequate capabilities to counter Iran's destabilizing activities and support shared interests, including stability and safety in the Middle East, and for other purposes."
4941  - Keep Our Pets Safe Act of 2018 H.Res.
842  - Recognizing Meningitis B Awareness Day H.R.
2147  - Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act of 2017 H.Res.
"763  - Calling upon the leadership of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to dismantle its labor camp system, and for other purposes."
4693  - Puppy Protection Act of 2017 Constituent Services: Let Us Help!
My team and I are here to help resolve problems you may have with the federal government.
"Caseworkers in the Brighton district office are ready to get to work, communicating with various agencies to ensure you get the fair treatment you deserve."
"Some of the issues we handle include: - Veterans benefits and medals - IRS tax problems - Immigration issues and visas - Federal employment benefits - Workers' compensation - Problems with health care, Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid plans If you have a problem and need assistance, please call my office: (810) 227-8600."
"KNOW YOUR NEIGHBOR The summer season is just around the corner, and for Oregonians, this usually means more time spent outside."
"Last summer, after two years of tough times with low water levels restricting access to the reservoir, I was able to go out on a tour of Detroit Lake with a pool that was 97% full, floating docks, and people enjoying the water."
Im looking forward to another great summer season ahead.
"I want to thank Marion County for their ongoing commitment to the lake, and Marion County Sheriff for keeping people safe out on the water."
"Whether youre out on Detroit Lake, catching sun out on the coast, or heading out for a hike somewhere in between, heres wishing everyone a safe and fun summer!"
"The last week of April was National Park Week, a week to celebrate the 417 sites throughout the National Parks System, including Crater Lake in Oregon."
"As Oregonians we love our national parks, but the problem is, we love them too much."
The backlog of maintenance needs for our parks has climbed to a whopping $11.6 billion.
"Our ability to enjoy and appreciate that natural beauty is limited when upkeep on our federal lands isnt sufficiently funded, allowing critical maintenance to fall by the wayside."
"Not only does that impact our enjoyment of the land, but it poses serious risks to the protection of these areas and hurts our communities that rely on the economic benefit from visitors."
Read about my plan to bring down that backlog and restore our national parks for generations to come.
"I had the pleasure of celebrating Earth Day this year at West Linn-Wilsonville School District's Center for Research in Environmental Sciences and Technologies (CREST), which partners with the local McDonalds to give a hands-on farming experience to students."
This program teaches our students about where our food comes from and how important a healthy diet is while they work to grow food for their own cafeteria.
"WORKING FOR OREGON Since the fall, Ive been sharing the stories of Oregonians, who are also Dreamers, on the House floor because right now hundreds of thousands of young folks throughout our communities are being recklessly kept in a limbo of uncertainty and fear."
"Unless Congress acts, we stand to lose so many talented young people from our workforce and communities, which is why I joined 240 of my colleagues  Democrats and Republicans alike  to introduce a queen-of-the-hill resolution to force a floor debate on four DACA solutions."
We must to protect these young folks and put an end to the unnecessary limbo that this administration has so heartlessly thrown them into.
"Ive been working for over a year now on solutions to bring down health costs and expand access to good, affordable care for every American."
"Affordable health care should be available for all, not a privilege for a few."
"Last year, I rolled out a plan to stabilize the individual marketplace, and recognized then that expanding access and ease of enrollment should be one of the core priorities of any market stabilization plan."
"Without enough healthy Americans enrolled in plans, we will continue to face instability, which is why this month I introduced the Pathway to Universal Coverage Act."
"My bill will make it easier for folks to enroll in plans, stabilizing the marketplace while moving us further down the path toward universal coverage."
"For our rural communities, state offices of rural health provide vital services to areas that often have limited resources and access to health services."
"Established in 1979, the Oregon Office of Rural Health (ORH) was created to improve the accessibility of quality health care for underserved rural Oregonians."
ORH worked to develop recruitment and retention programs to attract health care professionals to our underserved areas.
It has also connected our small rural health systems with state and federal resources while providing technical support for our rural health care delivery systems.
"This month, I introduced the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act of 2018 to continue to expand these crucial services that ensure our rural communities have access to affordable, quality health care."
"IN CASE YOU MISSED IT This month, I cosponsored the bipartisan Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act which will require judicial review of any decision to fire an independent special counsel, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller."
And the Senate has a bipartisan version of the bill as well.
The American people deserve to know the truth about how Russia interfered in our domestic elections and what can be done to secure future elections against this meddling.
All the facts need to come to light here.
"Thats why I stand by Robert Mueller and his independent counsel oversight investigation into the 2016 election, and will continue to fight to protect and preserve the current investigation."
"Mid-month, my bill to reauthorize the FDAs Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA) passed out of my Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health unanimously."
"This legislation will continue agreements between the FDA and the animal drug industry to pay user fees that help speed the approval of new drugs for farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians so they can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy."
"As a veterinarian in rural Oregon, I understand firsthand the importance of these bills."
"They allow veterinarians, companion animal owners, and livestock owners to have the same streamlined process our human counterparts have for their pharmaceuticals."
"This means better, cutting-edge care when our animals need it the most."
"They also recognize the smaller market share veterinary pharmaceuticals have, and allow for a unique and safe way to innovate in the marketplace for our four footed friends."
"News from Congressman Tom MacArthur  Home  Contact  Services  Media  Lindsey- I've always believed that members of both parties have to work together to solve tough problems facing our districts and our country, and I have always been willing to work with anyone to help South Jersey."
"In fact, just this week, I was ranked among the top 10% of bipartisan Members of Congress in the House by the non-partisan Lugar Center."
"Earlier in the week, I announced that I have cosponsored ten bipartisan bills that address a host of critical issues facing South Jersey including improving our schools, protecting domestic abuse victims, cracking down on human trafficking, and supporting our local fishermen."
"These bipartisan bills include: The Safe Schools Improvement Act which requires states to direct their local educational agencies to establish policies that prevent and prohibit conduct, including bullying and harassment."
The Pet and Women Safety Act which broadens the definition of stalking to include conduct that causes a person to experience a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to his or her pet.
The Human Trafficking Fraud Enforcement Act which establishes an office within the IRS that will investigate and prosecute violations of tax laws by persons that appear to be trafficking individuals.
The Transparent Summer Flounder Quotas Act which delays current reduction in Summer Flounder quota.
"Additionally, I've also introduced the Survey Our Military Impacted Schools Act with my Democrat colleague Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard."
"This bipartisan legislation requires the Department of Defense, along with other relevant agencies, to conduct a study and submit a report on the unmet capital improvement needs of schools that have a high concentration of military children and meet a certain criteria, like Northern Burlington County Regional School District."
It's important we understand the specific needs of these schools so we can ensure they are receiving the appropriate amount of aid in order to provide quality education for military children.
Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan      Nolan to Introduce Ban on Advertising and Marketing of Dangerous We will keep you posted as events proceed.
"Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts."
Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an email  .
"Sincerely, signature _____ Nolan's North Country Scenic Trail Bill Clears Committee and Heads for the House Floor  The measure, which will proceed to the full House for final passage, would help put the finishing touches on a unified 4,600-mile national hiking trail system that stretches from the plains of North Dakota through Minnesota's Arrowhead all the way to the forests of Vermont."
"With the spring hiking season finally on the way, the House Natural Resources Committee last week unanimously passed my bipartisan bill (H.R."
"1026) to incorporate more than 400 miles of existing trails in the Minnesota Boundary Waters, the Superior Hiking Trail, the Border Route Trail and the Kekekabic Trail into the North Country National Scenic Trail."
"The measure, which will proceed to the full House for final passage, would help put the finishing touches on a unified 4,600-mile national hiking trail system that stretches from the plains of North Dakota through Minnesota's Arrowhead all the way to the forests of Vermont."
It's important to note that the plan doesn't involve any new dollars or require taking any land through eminent domain.
The route skirts around and protects about 100 miles of environmentally sensitive bogs and wetlands in Northeastern Minnesota that had been included in an earlier suggested route.
"Here in Minnesota our trails provide an extra boost to a $13.6 billion annual tourism economy that already supports 254,000 good paying jobs."
"Because trail users get hungry and thirsty, so they spend money in our restaurants."
"They get tired, so they spend money staying in our hotels."
"They need supplies, so they patronize local businesses."
"Visitors fall in love with our region, so they return again and again."
"The American Hiking Association recently completed a study showing that when all the dollars spent on trail recreation work through the economy, the multiplier effect reaches $196 billion a year  supporting 768,000 good paying jobs nationwide."
"Moreover, experts tell us that for youngsters, hiking in the great outdoors helps alleviate something called the 'nature deficit,' a fancy term that means kids don't go outside much anymore."
"In fact, according to one study, the average kid in America today spends 7 minutes of every day outside, and 7 hours in front of a computer screen or a TV set."
Getting outside hiking is great for everyone's physical and mental health  kids and adults alike.
And it's good for our economic health as well.
_____ Republicans Endanger Farm Bill Passage - Abandon Historic Bipartisanship and Democratic Process  Click on the screen above to hear my opening statement on the proposed 2018 Farm Bill Republicans wrecked the Farm Bill last week.
"Instead of working in good faith with Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee to craft a strong bipartisan bill, they abandoned the democratic process and passed a weak, mean spirited version of their own on a party line vote, virtually assuring the GOP plan will go nowhere in the Senate."
"Over the strong objections of Democrats, including me, this GOP Farm Bill would do virtually nothing to improve the safety net farmers need to survive these tough economic times  nothing to encourage young farmers  and nothing to bolster rural communities and small businesses."
"What the bill does do is launch a partisan assault on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that some 46 million Americans  including women, children, the elderly, disabled and unemployed, and thousands of military Veterans and military families  depend on to stave off hunger and malnutrition."
"And by doing so, this attack on the SNAP program threatens to unravel the historic partnership between rural food producers and urban food consumers that has always been critical to the success of Farm Bills down through the years."
"The so-called ""work requirements"" added to the bill are unnecessary and duplicative of other work programs, bureaucratic, and would cost the states hundreds of millions of dollars to administer."
"What's more, there are nowhere near enough funds in this measure to provide meaningful help to able bodied SNAP recipients to train for and secure good paying living wage jobs."
"On another note, I joined Democratic colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee last week to urge the President to work closely with Congress on a final Farm Bill to provide farmers with all the support they need to weather possible retaliation by trade cheater nations like China after the President announced 25% tariffs on low grade subsidized foreign steel and aluminum."
"As I have said many times before, these tariffs are necessary to ensure the survival of our iron ore and steel industries."
But farmers should not be forced to bare the economic burden of these trade battles.
"_____ As Nolan Presses to Make College Affordable, Growing Numbers of Students Face Hunger and Homelessness  More than one in every three college students are food and housing insecure, and some nine percent are homeless according to a new study by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab."
"No college student should ever be forced into hunger and homelessness by the high cost of education, but according to a new study by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab, that's exactly what's happening to roughly one out of three young people who responded to a survey of 43,000 students attending 66 institutions around the Nation."
"Specifically, 36 percent of college students said they are both food and housing insecure  with not enough money to buy groceries, pay rent and cover utilities  while 9 percent reported being homeless."
"It's no surprise that according to the study, students in these situations have lower test scores, poorer grades and less chance of graduating than those with more resources."
At the root of these problems is the simple fact that college has become unaffordable to millions of our best and brightest young people.
"A four-year college education was virtually free for the parents, grandparents and great-grandparents of today's students, and it ought to be virtually free today to help ensure a prosperous future for our people and our Nation."
"That's why I've joined Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and numerous others here on the House side in championing our College for All Act to eliminate all tuition and fees for low and middle-income students at two and four-year public and tribal colleges and universities."
"Just consider that in 1979, it was possible to earn enough money to pay for a year of college tuition  averaging about $2,800 dollars  just by working four or five days a week at a summer job that paid minimum wage."
"Today, it would take a minimum wage employee an entire year of working 40 hours a week to pay the average cost of tuition, room and board of about $21,000 dollars."
"Furthermore, in 2017 twenty-two states reduced the money they spent per student on public colleges."
"That's up from the 17 states that saw drops in 2016 and the ten from 2015, according to an annual report that tracks state appropriations and tuition revenue at public colleges."
"_____ Our Week in DC  Last week, representatives of Minnesota United Snowmobilers Association attended their annual conference in Washington entitled ""Tell the Truth About Snowmobiling"" hosted by the American Council of Snowmobile Associations."

"She addressed the monthly Climate Change Talk hosted by Minnesota's Lake Superior Coastal Program, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Sea Grant, and 1854 Treaty Authority."
Dr. Hoppe described lessons learned from applying future climate estimates to public health investigations and the role scenario planning can play in our state's efforts to prepare for and respond to climate change.

They are leading changes in our economy and speaking up about challenges in our country.
"Whether it's the threat of gun violence in our schools, the challenge of starting a career in today's economy, the high cost of college tuition, or the impact that money and special interests have in our democracy, young folks are working to make a difference in their community."

"Passing a Bipartisan Spending Agreement If you read the previous edition  of my newsletter, you might remember that Congress had only passed legislation to fund the government until March 23."
"In fact, so far this fiscal year, Congress saw two government shutdowns and five stop-gap spending bills (known as continuing resolutions)."
This is no way to run a government.
"Thankfully, on March 23, Congress passed a spending bill that finally, fully funds the government until the end of the fiscal year."
"No compromise is ever perfect, but I voted for this plan because there are important investments for folks in our necks of the woods, and because our country has to stop lurching from crisis to crisis."
This bill invests in the American people and makes a difference on many of the challenges facing our region.
There are families that have been ravaged by the scourge of opioids who will benefit from the funding this bill dedicates to combatting the opioid crisis.
"There are people on the Olympic Peninsula who will have a better shot economically as a result of funding for fighting wildfires, funding for rural schools and rural broadband."
"There are tens of thousands of servicemembers and defense workers in our region who have asked for an end to furloughs and chaos, and this bill finally gives them certainty."
"This bill will provide help to fishermen in Westport who are wondering if they can fish for another season, or if they need to put a for sale sign on their boats because of repeated natural disasters."
The bill will help grow jobs by funding important infrastructure projects (through the federal TIGER Grant program and other important efforts).
Families in our region and local businesses that depend on clean water will benefit from funding to keep the Puget Sound clean and healthy.
"This bill invests in folks who work in our forests, so that our timber industry can innovate and find new ways to compete in the global economy."
And it takes the first step forward to making sure that America's elections are free from foreign influence and dark money.
"By getting this bill passed, hopefully this will now give Congress time to work on the rest of our nation's most pressing challenges."
I hope the bipartisan cooperation that produced this bill will translate into bipartisan action that gives certainty to Dreamers and makes progress on other important priorities requiring attention and action.
I created this video  to explain more about how this bill can create jobs in our region.
I also outlined some of my important priorities that passed in the bill here  .
Standing up for our Veterans Our region has more veterans than almost any other part of the country.
That's why I formed a Veterans Advisory Council when I came to Congress.
"This volunteer group has given me great advice, and they've spent a lot of time helping me understand what folks in our neck of the woods want from their government."
"Last week, I got an update from them (just in time given the changeover at the VA)."
It is important to me that our VA system is serving those who served.
I'll keep pushing to make it better.
"In the spending bill that passed a couple of weeks ago, I was able to get a couple of provisions important to support veterans."
"Specifically, I secured a provision in the bill that could be a big help to veterans buying a house."
"Right now, veterans are at a disadvantage when they go to bid on a house using VA loans, because the appraisal process is so much more burdensome that often sellers choose other candidates."
"The Tacoma News Tribune reported on this issue last year, and my team and I dug into the issue local veterans to determine the scope of the problem."
"Rather than ignoring the problem, we got language in the spending bill directing the VA to come up with--and report to Congress on--a plan of attack."
That's the first step in creating policies to fix this problem.
I'll keep you posted once we get the report back.
"The News Tribune wrote an update on this story, which you can read here  ."
The spending bill also included legislation I worked on with Rep. Dan Newhouse called the VA Management Alignment Act.
It comes just as the management at the VA is changing.
The bill directs the VA to address management issues to ensure veterans across the country are getting the care they earned and deserve.
You can read more about this bill here.
"Righting a wrong Imagine counting down the days to your retirement, then putting in the paperwork and finding out from your boss that you have to work years longer than co-workers who started the same day as you because of how the government calculates the time you worked."
Some folks at the shipyard came to me with this exact problem.
"I think Washington, DC can do better for the people who devoted their lives to keeping the Navy's ships afloat."
I just introduced legislation to fix the problem so that federal workers can make catch-up payments so they can retire on-time with full retirement benefits.
You can read about the bill here  .
I introduced this legislation because a constituent reached out to my office with a concern about his own retirement.
"Without that knowledge, I wouldn't be able to make this situation right."
That's why I always ask you to let me know if you or someone you know needs a hand.
Working for You I got an update from the Mason County Sheriff on their work to help people in our community struggling with opioids.
"I'm working in Congress to secure funding to help people get treatment for opioid addiction and support local communities, and I'm pleased to report that the spending bill Congress passed included $3.3 billion in help--that brings the total funding from Congress over the last few months to nearly $10 billion."
But that's only the start.
Congress needs to do far more so people facing addiction can get help from medical professionals and have access to better treatment options.
I also had the chance to tour the awesome Haven Boatworks--this small business employs about 25 people to repair and restore wooden boats.
This is an example of the great jobs available to folks who learn a skilled trade.
I visited students and teachers at Port Townsend High School.
Thanks for sharing your ideas and concerns with me.
"As I told these insightful young people: no matter how young you are, your voice matters."
"I'm going to keep working with everyone, every day from every angle to make sure the grown-ups in Washington, DC listen and take action so everyone feels safe at school and everywhere else."
"Finally, I got to visit Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium where I got an update on their new aquarium and their policy priorities (including protecting red wolves and other conservation efforts)."
"I even got to pet a lynx (which, thankfully, did not eat me after this photo was taken)."
OK--that's it for this time.
Stay tuned for more updates!

"We all have different resources, talents, and passions, but one of the great things about a community as cohesive as ours is that the desire to help comes as second nature to us."
"From the inspiring service of our first-responders day-in and day-out, to the actions of a caring and observant mail-carrier like Amanda Nalley of Forsyth County, examples are everywhere...."

"News from Representative Gus Bilirakis     facebook  twitter  you tube   March 18, 2018 Dear Friend, Last week was one of mixed emotion for me."
"There were accomplishments for which I am really proud, such as the bipartisan effort to authorize significant funding to improve school safety."
I will discuss this important achievement in greater detail below.
"However, there were also significant moments of frustration, such as the failed attempt to pass the Right to Try legislation, which is very important to me and to so many patients who are suffering with a terminal illness."
"For years, I have been working on a variety of initiatives to streamline FDA processes and empower patients in the development of their treatment plans."
"We have made progress, but not enough."
Patients facing a painful death who have exhausted all available approved treatments do not have time to wait through bureaucratic processes.
"The Right to Try bill provides a compassionate, responsible mechanism for terminally ill patients, who would not otherwise qualify for a clinical trial, to participate in experimental procedures and treatments."
"With this bill, we would be giving them dignity, hope and self-determination while advancing medical research that will benefit many future patients."
"I was very disappointed that we did not garner enough votes it would have taken to pass the bill this week; however, I have received assurances that the bill will be brought back to the House floor in near future."
"Through my work with the rare disease community, I have met many terminally ill patients, and I am inspired by their courage."
I will not stop fighting for them.
"To all of you with Irish roots, I hope you are enjoying a safe and joyous St. Patrick's Day weekend."
"Yesterday, as I was meeting with constituents, I was reminded of an old Irish adage: Always remember that hindsight is the best insight to foresight."
I will keep this message close to my heart as I return to D.C. next week to tackle the spending bill that is needed for continued government operation and many policy matters that remain before us.
Please continue reading for a brief recap of the rest of my work on your behalf last week.
"Protecting our Children Last week, the House passed an important measure I cosponsored, the STOP School Violence Act."
"This bill authorizes funding to train law enforcement, school personnel and students to recognize and respond to warning signs so that school violence can be prevented."
"It also provides funding for technology and equipment to improve school security, as well as, threat assessment and crisis intervention teams."
The goal with this bill is to ensure that every child has a safe learning environment.
"While this bill is not a cure-all to address the problem, it does represent a significant step forward in preventing violence and helping to protect our children."
I also co-authored a bi-partisan letter  urging House appropriators to prioritize school safety measures in the upcoming budget package that will sustain government operations for the current year.
I will continue to ensure my strong feelings on this subject are known because I understand how important this issue is for the millions of children and families throughout our country.
"In talking to parents, teachers, law enforcement and superintendents in our community, I also understand we need a trained law enforcement officer at every school."
I have pledged to support our local school districts achieve this goal and have shared information with them about the federal COPS grant program within the Department of Justice which is available to help fund additional School Resource Officers.
I am working to secure additional federal funding for the COPS program in the upcoming budget.
"Additionally, I applaud the Department of Justice's announcement that it intends to hold those who lie on their application to purchase a firearm accountable for their crime."
"To augment this effort, I have recently co-sponsored HR 4471, the NICS Denial Notification Act, which will ensure appropriate state authorities are also notified so that they may also pursue enhanced criminal charges."
I want to be sure that those who should not have access to weapons are prevented from doing so.
"Advocating for Health Care Issues I had an informative meeting last week with the Surgeon General of Florida, Dr. Celeste Phillip."
"We discussed her department's disaster response efforts, the opioid epidemic and other public health issues."
Working hand in hand with state officials ensures that all levels of government are on the same page and being as responsive as possible to critical health concerns.
"While she was in my office, we were joined by a group of health care advocates who presented me with a special award for my efforts to ensure access to health care."
It was an honor to receive the Champion Award (pictured below) by the National Association of Community Health Centers for my sponsorship of legislation to preserve this vital resource within our health care system.
"Supporters of community health centers from around the state of Florida, including our very own Elodie Dorso from the Community Health Center of Pinellas were on hand to recognize me with this prestigious award."
"As I shared with them, leading the charge to ensure that these centers remain a viable option for the insured, uninsured and underinsured to receive high quality primary care, mental health and dental care was a priority for me coming into this Congress, and I was proud to have the provision I authored signed into law just a few short weeks ago."
"Additionally, in last week's Health Subcommittee hearing, we discussed an issue that is near and dear to many of our hearts."
"The FDA doesn't just oversee the regulation of medication for humans, but for animals too."
"We are nearing the expiration of that statutory authority, and as part of the reauthorization, we discussed a variety of issues that exist in order to ensure that our four legged friends are receiving the best possible care."
"As the co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus for the Humane Bond, I work very hard to ensure animals are protected."
"Whether it's the relationship between a service therapy dog changing the life of Veteran suffering with Post Traumatic Stress, a military hero dog keeping its handler out of harm's way or a pet providing companionship to a senior, the bond between a person and an animal can often be lifesaving."
There was a recent article  outlining the bold steps recently taken by the Florida Legislature to combat the opioid crisis.
"It is very important that federal, state and local lawmakers work together on these issues to ensure coordinated policies that protect patients."
The state of Florida has implemented many of the measures we have been working on at the federal level.
"For example, I recently called upon the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to explore opportunities to require inter-state connectivity of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)."
"Additionally, I have supported modernization of and required physician participation in the PDMP."
"Under the leadership of Governor Scott, these common sense policies will now be the law in Florida."
"As part of my work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I will continue to lead in finding a delicate balance that protects patients, prevents abuse, provides access to treatment, holds those who are exploiting others accountable and ensures that patients with legitimate pain have access to the medication they need."
I look forward to continued collaboration with state partners on this important issue as we work to protect all Floridians.
"Providing Accountability and Oversight of the VA This week, I participated in two VA hearings in which we reviewed the agency's budget proposals for the upcoming year for both its health care and benefits programs."
I was particularly interested in its plans for expediting the review of appeals claims.
"While I agreed with many of the priorities the agency identified, there are still opportunities for improvement."
"During my comments, I highlighted the importance of mental health, appropriate supports for Veterans' transition to civilian life and targeted research which can help many Veterans such as those who have been exposed to toxins."
"In the year ahead, I look forward to continuing to exercise our Committee's oversight authority to ensure that Veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve."
"Additionally, I remain committed to finding a way to ensure that the agency honors its commitment to our Blue Water Navy Veterans."
"To watch my comments during the hearing, please click here."
Protecting our Seniors During Emergencies I applaud the state of Florida for passing a new law  to require nursing homes and assisted living facilities to have a generator and back-up fuel available in the event of an emergency.
I have co-sponsored legislation at the federal level to require similar safeguards to ensure our seniors are protected.
"We should never again see the most vulnerable among us suffer, or God forbid die, after a natural disaster because those entrusted with their care failed to take proper precautions."

"March 17, 2018 MONDAY IN OK I spent Monday in Muskogee before heading to Washington this week."
"My first stop was the Muskogee VA Medical Center, where two of my veteran caseworkers, Jason Self and William Barnesboth Oklahoma veterans themselveswere awarded certificates of commendation by the Muskogee VA for their work assisting Oklahoma veterans in their darkest hours."
"(From left: Congressman Mullin, William Barnes, Jason Self, and VA Medical Center Director Mark Morgan.)"
The commendation reads: Your commitment to a regular meeting with Veterans throughout Eastern Oklahoma and building their confidence as a Veteran Advocate resulted in this Veteran contacting you for help when he needed it the most.
"Your regular attendance to VA Suicide Prevention trainings and fostering good relationships with VA staff resulted in this Veteran receiving immediate mental health care on a holiday and being transported to a safe environmentPreventing Veteran suicide is a top priority in the Department of Veteran Affairs, and for the VA to be successful in combating Veteran suicide we need strong community partners and good communication."
Your actions confirm how much the office of Congressman Markwayne Mullin cares about the Veterans in Oklahoma.
For this I commend you on behalf of the Eastern Oklahoma VA Health Care System and on behalf of our Veterans.
"If my team can ever assist you or a veteran in need, please dont hesitate to contact my office at 918-687-2533."
"Later in the day, I visited the Tony Goetz Elementary School to speak with students and teachers."
There are so many issues impacting our schools and students in Oklahoma today and I was grateful to be able to spend this time hearing their concerns.
Enjoyed visiting Tony Goetz Elementary School this week!

"As the sponsor of ADUFA, I hope to see the House move swiftly on reauthorization of the animal drug user fee agreements for the health and safety of our animals and our food supply."
"In rural and agriculture communities across the country, ADUFA and its generic version, AGDUFA, are critical for farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians."
"Moreover, its vital for the food supply of all American consumers."
"The reauthorization of these animal user fee agreements between the FDA and the animal drug industry help speed the approval of new drugs so that farmers, ranchers, families, and veterinarians can keep their animals and pets safe and healthy."
Read more about our committees work on ADUFA and AGDUFA on their website at this link.
"HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE On Wednesday, the House passed the STOP School Violence Act by a vote of 407  10."

"I also asked White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to fire President Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, talked with MSNBC about the President's possibly illegal payments to an adult film star, met with Tennessee educators in my D.C. office, introduced a bill to prevent the inhumane treatment of animals on airplanes, received an award from the Memphis Health Center, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Robert Kennedy, reminded constituents of an upcoming March 20 telephone town hall, noted the passing of my friend the New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, and expressed my concern about a measles case at the Memphis airport."

Kennedy  Reminding Constituents of My Telephone Town Hall on Tuesday Evening Signing Up for ""Congress On Your Corner"" and this e-Newsletter Noting the Passing of New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter Weekly Health Tip Quote of the Week _____ Joining Students in Demanding a Response to Gun Violence   On Wednesday, in solidarity with students at the University of Memphis and Rhodes College and students across the country, I remembered the 17 victims of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in calling for a meaningful, legislative response to the nation's epidemic of gun violence."
"On Capitol Hill, local students and field-trippers from around the country gathered in a symbolic show of support for gun violence victims and to call attention to the upcoming ""March for Our Lives"" events taking place around the country on March 24th."
"I commend the organizers of the Memphis march to begin at Clayborn Temple, 294 Hernando Street, at 10 a.m. on March 24th."
"In a related effort, I voted Wednesday for the Students, Teachers and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act (H.R."
"4909), which passed 407 to 10."
"Asking White House Chief of Staff to Fire Jared Kushner As evidence piles up establishing Trump son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner's serious conflicts of interest involving his family's real estate business, I joined 25 House colleagues in a letter to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly demanding Kushner's firing."
"The letter makes the case that Kushner, who could not obtain a permanent security clearance and recently had his security status downgraded, is a threat to national security, especially in light of published accounts that he is considered a lightweight by the United Arab Emirates, China, Mexico and Israel, and could potentially be manipulated based on his tangled business interests and lack of policy experience."
"Talking Stormy Daniels with MSNBC's David Gura  On Saturday, I  went on national television  to talk about the ongoing legal scandal involving the President and Stephanie Clifford (adult film star Stormy Daniels) with MSNBC's David Gura."
I'm embarrassed for the country that this President has besmirched his high office with this and other lurid evidence of low moral character.
"Meeting with Tennessee Parent Teacher Association  Also Wednesday, I met with Tennessee Parent Teacher Association President Cheryl Floyd and Anita Allen to talk about the organization's top priorities this year."
It's always good to get a briefing from those on the front lines in education.
"Introducing Bipartisan Bill Outlawing Pets from Overhead Compartments Many of my constituents know of my longstanding association with the humane treatment of animals (I recently received another ""100+"" score from the Humane Society)."
"Because of that and also being a senior member of the Transportation Committee, I felt it necessary to address an item right out of the news this week with the introduction Thursday of the Planes Ensuring Total Safety (PETS) Act  ."
"Our bill responds to the outrageous situation the owner of 10-month-old French bulldog Kokito endured when her dog was stuffed, barking in distress, into an unventilated overhead United Airlines luggage bin on a flight from Houston to New York and died as a result."
The bill would outlaw the practice and impose fines on airlines that don't comply.
I was pleased to join New York Republican Congressman Dan Donovan on the bill.
"A Senate companion measure, the WOOFF Act, has been introduced by Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana and Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada."
"Receiving Award from the Memphis Health Center  On Thursday, representatives of the Memphis Health Center presented me with the 2018 Distinguished Community Health Defender Award."
"Community Health Centers, like the Memphis Health Center, are crucial in the fight against illnesses and disabilities."
"I was proud to vote for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which provided two years of funding for our Community Health Centers."
"Investing in our Community Health Centers is not only prudent, but necessary."
"I will continue to advocate for Community Health Centers, and I was honored to receive this recognition."
"Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Death of Robert F. Kennedy  On Wednesday, I joined Massachusetts' Senator Edward Markey and Congressman Joseph Kennedy III, and others, in recalling the remarkable life of my hero, former U.S. Attorney General, New York Senator and 1968 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy."
Robert Kennedy was a remarkable leader and would have made an excellent president if he hadn't been assassinated in Los Angeles two months after the killing of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis.
"Today, March 16th, is the 50th anniversary of RFK's announcement of his candidacy for the 1968 nomination for President."
It is sad but deeply edifying to review the events of that revolutionary year.
"Toward the end of my remarks, I paraphrased Robert Kennedy, who said: ""Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope"" See my remarks at the commemoration here  ."
"Reminding Constituents of My Telephone Town Hall on Tuesday Evening  To talk to constituents while I'm in Washington, I've found telephone town halls timely and have appreciated the positive response from constituents."
"My next telephone town hall is Tuesday, March 20, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. Central time."
The telephone town hall provides a good forum to hear the concerns and ideas of the 9th District and gives me an opportunity to provide legislative action.
"For those who haven't participated in a telephone town hall, it's easy to sign up for them by using this form  ."
"Signing Up for ""Congress On Your Corner"" and My Weekly e-Newsletter I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies."

"Noting the Passing of New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter  On Friday, I learned of the death of my friend and colleague, New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter."
"In her lifetime of service, she was always at the top of her game and I was always astonished to watch her, even at age 88, never miss a beat."
"She knew the issues backwards and forwards, including the arcane details of House rules."
"A native of Kentucky, she was a knowledgeable and gracious Southern Belle but a strong and passionate advocate of her Empire State."
"Weekly Health Tip Each week, I share a health tip in the hopes of promoting a healthy lifestyle for residents of the 9th Congressional District."
"As always, it is best to check with your doctor before making any changes to your diet, exercise routine or lifestyle."
"I was concerned to read that a child with measles landed at Memphis International Airport on Monday night after a flight from Brussels, Belgium."
The scourge of this infectious disease is largely wiped out around the world thanks to nearly universal preventive immunization but its disfiguring symptoms and sometimes-life-threatening fevers are something all parents naturally fear.
I want to assure you that my office is keeping close track of any and all developments related to this incident.
"To read more about measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) see this notice  Quote of the Week  ""My favorite poet was Aeschylus."
"He once wrote, 'And even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.'"
What we need in the United States is not division.
What we need in the United States is not hatred.
"What we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another, a feeling of justice to those who still suffer in our country, whether they be white or whether they be black."""
"Friend, As southern and southwest Ohio experiences heavy rainfall and high flood waters, let's keep an eye out for our friends and neighbors affected by the floods, and remember to take a moment to thank the employees and volunteers working to contain the damage."

"In your service, When President Trump visited Cincinnati in early February, First Lady Melania Trump visited Cincinnati Children's Hospital to call attention to the devastating impacts of the opioid crisis on children."
The First Lady was briefed by representatives at Cincinnati Children's about neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).
NAS can occur when a baby is exposed to opioids during pregnancy.
"Symptoms include seizures, vomiting, and wakefulness."
"In some cases, it can be fatal."
"Symptoms may not appear for up to three days after birth, so it's incredibly important to identify at-risk babies before they leave the hospital."
"I recently hosted a briefing at the Capitol, where we heard from doctors at Cincinnati Children's Hospital about the important protocols they've created to identify and treat NAS babies before they leave the hospital."
I am optimistic that other states can learn from Ohio's leadership and pioneering approach to identifying and treating babies with NAS.
"Combatting illicit opioid use in our communities will take time, effort, and significant resources."
"To that point, the recent Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included an extra $6 billion in funding to continue our fight against opioid abuse in our communities."
It was great meeting with the Angel's Rest Animal Society in Amelia.
"Many homeless individuals, including veterans, will not seek medical care or enter short-term shelters because their pets are not permitted to accompany them."
"Angel's Rest told me how they're teaming up with Welcome House Northern Kentucky and other veterans groups to provide services to homeless veterans and individuals, including transitional pet boarding so that our homeless neighbors can get the help they need to regain their footing."
"I recently toured Thomaston Woods, an affordable housing project for families in Southern Ohio."

"I also saw my SOAR Act designed to help identify victims of human trafficking pass the House; urged federal aviation safety officials to take action on airplane evacuation safety as called for in my SEAT Act; talked with Aaron Gilchrist of MSNBC, Wolf Blitzer of CNN and Larry King about the President and gun violence; received 100 percent scores from environmental, social justice and animal rights groups; and offered a health tip on antibiotic resistance."

"Nicholas Vieron; Bottom: Congressman Cohen at press availability with House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer, Sen. Lamar Alexander and Rep. John Lewis   Earlier today, I joined many of my Congressional colleagues from around the country in solemn observances of the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. here 50 years ago."
"We visited the Mason Temple, where Dr. King made his final speech, and the Lorraine Motel, where he was assassinated."
Im encouraged to see the genuine interest shown in the world-renown historical events that occurred in our streets and the tribute my colleagues are eager to pay to Dr. King.
"I commended my friend Senator Lamar Alexander, who introduced the Senate version of my Resolution Commemorating the Sanitation Workers and helped it pass the Senate earlier this week."
Both Senator Alexander and I spoke at the Mason Temple and Lorraine events.
I was pleased to welcome the Civil Rights hero Congressman John Lewis to the Bluff City once again.
"As the nation and the world turns its eyes to Memphis now and in the weeks ahead, I want to thank my constituents for the opportunity to help our city showcase our historic role in the Civil Rights Movement."
"Passing the SOAR Act to Identify Victims of Human Trafficking    On Monday, the House passed the Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond (SOAR) to Health and Wellness Act (H.R."
"767), a bill I introduced to set up $4 million a year in grants to health care professionals to identify victims of human trafficking."
"In a floor speech, I noted that many trafficking victims have occasional access to health facilities in the course of their captivity but few health facilities are trained to recognize the tell-tale signs that might lead to their freedom."
"I want to thank my bipartisan co-sponsors, Reps. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill."
The bill passed the House on a voice vote.
"Urging Action on Airplane Evacuation Safety with Federal Aviation Officials    On Tuesday, I questioned top safety officialsfrom the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about the growing safety hazards posed by increasingly smaller seats on airlines, noting the recent accident involving a cabin fire on American Airlines flight 383 in Chicago."
"On flight 383, the emergency evacuation took over 50 seconds longer than the 90-second federal standard."
"The NTSB issued recommendations to examine the issue of emergency evacuations further after string of nearly fatal accidents and, subsequently, a Federal Appellate court ordered the FAA to examine the safety of emergency evacuations in light of shrinking seat sizes."
"Ali Bahrami, the Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety of the FAA, assured me that a study of airplane evacuations is under way."
"As the author of the SEAT Act (Seat Egress in Air Travel), which would require the FAA to establish a minimum seat size and minimum distances between rows of seats (approved by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and awaiting a vote by the full House as part of a broader FAA Reauthorization package), I dont think those assurances go far enough and I hope to see my legislation to protect the safety of the flying public become law in coming weeks."
"Talking with MSNBCs Aaron Gilchrist on Gun Violence    On Sunday, I appeared on MSNBC to talk about the possibility that Congress and the President would address gun violence in the wake of the horrible shooting deaths at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida."
I told him I expected Republicans to permit modest reforms but mostly just lip service to more substantive proposals because so many members are beholden to the National Rifle Association.
"I also said that the dishonesty of the President on a host of issues, including his positions on guns, is becoming more of a problem, adding that half the time hes lying and the other half to the time hes simply wrong."
See the interview here.
"On Saturday just after noon, I am scheduled to be on MSNBC again, this time with host Alex Witt."
"Discussing Jared Kushners Business Conflicts with CNNs Wolf Blitzer      On Thursday, I was interviewed by CNNs Wolf Blitzer about the Presidents changing and inconsistent views on a variety of gun violence measures, including his astonishing support for seizing the guns of the suspected mentally ill before seeking due process in court."
I was also asked about Trump son-in-law Jared Kushners obvious deal-making and conflicts of interest as a presidential aide.
See the interview here.
"Kibitzing with Larry King about Trumps Gun Positions      On Monday evening, I talked with my friend Larry King from Statuary Hall in the Capitol about the positions taken by the NRA in response to the Florida school shooting and the Presidents parroting of those talking points."
"I told him raising the age for buying high-capacity assault rifles to 21 would be a tiny move and would do nothing to address shooters such as the 64-year-old who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in October or the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooter in November, who was 26."
We have a problem with mass shootings.
See the interview here(interview begins at 9:00 minute mark).
"Receiving 100 percent scores on Environment, Social Justice and Animal Welfare   This week, the Humane Society, the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and the League of Conservation Voters all gave me 100 percent scores for positions I took in the first session of the 115th Congress."
"Actually, the Humane Society gave me 100 Percent Plus for my sponsorship of the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act (H.R."
1847) and the Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act (H.R.
I appreciate the recognition and pledge to continue working hard in these important policy areas.
Writing to Caution Governor Haslam about H.B.
"2251  On Thursday, I wrote to Governor Bill Haslam with deep concern about a Tennessee state legislative bill, H.B."
"2251, that would direct the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to amend the existing TennCare waiver to exclude providers who offer advice about or perform privately funded abortions."
The Medicaid program has been set up to ensure that Medicaid recipients have the freedom to choose which medical professionals they see.
"2251 passed, it would lead to a reduction in the number of health care professionals offering a wide range of preventive services to women, including access to birth control, cancer screenings, and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing and treatment."
It would make needed health care inaccessible to many low-income women.
I urged the Governor to oppose the legislation and to veto it if it reaches his desk.
Inviting Constituents to Sign Up for Telephone Town Halls and Attend Congress on Your Corner     I enjoy meeting regularly with constituents in the district and helping get answers for them to questions about dealing with federal agencies.

Quote of the Week    I just want to do God's will.
And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
And I've looked over.

I may not get there with you.
"But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land."
So I'm happy tonight.
I'm not worried about anything.
"Latest from Lamar, Notes from the Senate Desk Last Thursday at noon, the United States Senate observed a moment of silence for the victims of Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida."
My prayers are with the victims of this tragic shooting and their families.
"*Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Memphis Sanitation Workers' Strike * Fifty years ago, 1,300 African-American sanitation workers in Memphis took a stand for freedom."
African-American sanitation workers had faced years of hazardous working conditions and discrimination in pay and benefits.
Their strike would become an historic event in the civil rights movement.
"In January 1968, the workers began negotiating with Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb and the Memphis City Council to improve pay and working conditions."
"The deaths of two sanitation workers galvanized the 1,300 African American sanitation workers to protest working conditions in February 1968."
"Throughout February and early March negotiations continued, and on March 28, 1968, Rev."
"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Reverend James Lawson led a march from the Clayborn Temple that ended with rioting, arrests, and the death of 16-year-old Larry Payne."
"On April 3, 1968, Dr. King addressed a rally of 10,000 African American workers and residents, members of the clergy, and union members at Mason Temple, the Memphis headquarters of the Church of God in Christ."
"Dr. King was assassinated the next day on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel."
"Four days later, on April 8, 1968, 42,000 people marched in Memphis."
"The strike was resolved on April 16, 1968."
"Last week, I, along with Senators Bob Corker , Doug Jones, and Ben Cardin introduced [link 1] a resolution honoring their legacy and recognizing their sacrifice and contributions to the civil rights movement."
"It is important that our children grow up learning about how these 1,300 Memphis sanitation workers - and many others - struggled for racial justice."
"My thoughts on the Senate's work on immigration* Last week, the Senate debated several immigration proposals."
"My goal is to get a result on both border security and DACA, which is why I cosponsored and voted for Senator Grassley's legislation implementing the president's proposal, and why I also cosponsored and voted for the narrower bipartisan proposal offered by Senators Rounds and King--because it too solves the DACA problem and provides the $25 billion the president requested to improve border security."
"I also voted for legislation offered by Senator Pat Toomey that would withhold some federal funding from ""sanctuary cities"" that do not cooperate with federal agencies to enforce federal immigration laws."
"Last Thursday, after the Senate failed to get a result on immigration, I spoke on the Senate floor."
I said that the president had done his job -- he saw an urgent need and recommended a strategy to deal with that need.
"So my hope is that the president will continue to advocate for a result, to do that, he has to persuade at least half the people he's right."
He's a good persuader.
Then the Senate will be able to do our job.
That's not to stand in the corners and throw things at each other.
Let's see where we can agree and do what we did on Civil Rights and fixing No Child Left Behind -- tackle big issues by finding consensus.
Immigration is not any harder than those issues.
We ought to be able to do it.
Otherwise we shouldn't be here.
"It's hard to become a United States Senator, and while we're here, we might as well amount to something - and that means getting a result."
We didn't reach a result last week but I'm convinced we can.
"*Last Wednesday morning, Tennessee songwriters brought a little Nashville to Washington, visiting my office to play a few of their songs and talk about the Music Modernization Act - a bill I introduced last month that will help them and thousands of other songwriters in Tennessee be paid fair market value for their songs."
"* On January 24, I introduced bipartisan legislation - sponsored by Senator Hatch, Senator Corker and six other senators - that will have a real impact on Tennessee songwriters in three ways: First, the legislation creates a simple licensing system for digital music services to reflect a changing music industry."
"Second, the legislation will make it easier for songwriters to be paid when their music is played online or someone buys a song they wrote."
"And third, the legislation will allow a songwriter to be paid the fair market value for their work."
"The bipartisan bill represents the first major consensus legislation that has the support of songwriters, music publishers, digital music companies and record labels."
Now it is up to Congress to provide a solution.
This is why I am working in a bipartisan way to pass the Music Modernization Act this year and help give Tennessee - and our nation's - songwriters the fair pay they have earned.
"#StandWithSongwriters *My thoughts on President Trump's budget* Last week, President Trump released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2019."
"The president may suggest a budget, but, under the Constitution, Congress sets spending priorities and passes the appropriations bills that fund the government."
"As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will carefully consider the president's recommendations, but my priorities will continue to be making sure our national defense, national laboratories, the National Institutes of Health and national parks have the resources they need."
One proposal in the president's budget I strongly disagree with is selling the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission lines.
This is a looney idea that seems to keep popping up regardless of who is president.
It has zero chance of becoming law.
"When President Obama proposed this in 2013, all it did was undermine TVA's credit, raise interest rates on its debt, and threaten to increase electric bills for 9 million Tennessee Valley ratepayers."
"I am encouraged the president's budget request includes a proposal to help address the National Park Service maintenance backlog, including at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park."
"I agree that we have a responsibility to address the growing maintenance backlog in our parks - which includes roads, buildings, campgrounds, trails, water systems and more - and working with Interior Secretary Zinke and my colleagues in Congress, I will introduce [link 6] bipartisan legislation in the coming weeks to restore and rebuild our national parks."
I enjoyed speaking and answering questions last week at the Community College Congressional Forum about our work in the Senate education committee I chair to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.
"I've always said that community colleges are the ""secret weapon"" of our higher education system, especially at a time when so many Americans need post-secondary education in order to find a good job."
"*Animal drug user fee legislation is critical to keeping our food supply safe and animals healthy * Last Tuesday, the Senate health committee I chair held a hearing on updating the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Drug and Generic Animal Drug User Fee Agreements."
"We know that the human medical products we use are safe because the FDA has approved them - and the way that farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians know drugs for animals are safe is the same - the FDA has approved them."
"Similar to the user fee agreements the committee reauthorized [link 8] last year for human medical products, this year we need to reauthorize the Animal Drug and Generic Animal Drug User Fee Agreements."
"These agreements help bring these new medicines to the veterinarians who help keep animals healthy and treat diseases and for families to care for their pets, such as cancer or heartworm disease."
We also want to ensure the farmers and ranchers raising our food supply are able to treat their animals with the safe drugs they need.
Safe and effective animal drugs ARE important to both the consumer - that food-producing animals are safe to eat - and the farmer or rancher - that he has a safe and effective product to treat his animals and prevent outbreaks.
"According to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, the cattle and calves industry and the poultry industry are two of Tennessee's largest agriculture sectors."
"So it is important that farmers and ranchers continue to have access to new medicines to keep their animals healthy and prevent and treat diseases, and help keep our food supply safe."
"Senator Murray, the lead Democrat on our committee, and I introduced legislation to reauthorize these agreements last Thursday."
"I look forward to a timely reauthorization of these agreements to ensure farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, and families continue to have access to new safe and effective treatments."
"Last Tuesday, I attended a meeting at the White House, where I discussed trade issues with President Trump and my colleagues in Congress."
I talked about when my dad worked at Alcoa's aluminum smelting plant.
"Today, companies like Arconic are creating new jobs to make auto parts from aluminum."
"Arconic employs more than 1,600 Tennesseans, and the auto manufacturing industry supports 130,000 jobs in Tennessee."
"*Last Tuesday, President Trump announced the nomination of Dr. Brent Park to serve as Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation at the Department of Energy."
"* Dr. Park serves as Associate Laboratory Director at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where he manages national security programs for the United States Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration, and was previously director of research programs at Los Alamos National Laboratory."
"His professional experience makes him uniquely qualified for this position, and I look forward to his confirmation by the United States Senate."
"Congressman Tom Marino, Proudly Representing the 10th District of Pennsylvania *Working for PA-10* *From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:* Good morning, This week in the House, I voted for programs critical to our communities, discouraged sexual harassment in the workplace and kept our nation safe and free."
I also introduced legislation to protect animals and recognized PA-10 athletes competing in the Winter Olympics in South Korea.
Here are some of the highlights of my work in Washington on behalf of Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District: *Funding our Nation's Priorities* I was pleased to join my House colleagues to pass the *Bipartisan Budget Act [link 1] *which keeps the federal government open and increases funding for America's military.
This legislation includes numerous programs [link 2] that are a priority to PA-10 and ensures our brave troops get the resources they need to protect our freedoms.
Many of my constituents rely on the services provided by Community Health Centers [link 3] and Teaching Health Centers [link 4] to enhance their quality of life.
This measure also repeals Obamacare's onerous Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).
*Fostering a Safe Work Environment* News of a secretive process [link 5] for settling sexual harassment complaints against members of Congress sent shockwaves across Capitol Hill.
"To address this unacceptable practice, the House passed two bipartisan measures [link 6] that promote greater accountability and transparency for the congressional workplace."
Any form of sexual harassment is completely unacceptable.
I recently introduced legislation to ensure taxpayers not foot the bill [link 7] for the misdeeds of federal lawmakers and to require repayment [link 8] of public funds used to settle those cases.
"*Protecting Animals* As an animal lover, it breaks my heart to see any animal suffer or die because they are left in a parked vehicle in extreme heat or cold."
That is why I introduced the *Keep Our Pets Safe Act* [link 9].
This commonsense legislation makes it a federal offense to leave a pet in a car.
"if the animal could die as result of excessive exposure to heat or cold, lack of ventilation, or lack of water."
I strongly urge my colleagues in the House to support this bill.
*Looking out for Taxpayers* During income tax filing season there have been a growing number of cybercriminals who steal data from tax practitioners' computers and submit fraudulent returns requesting refunds with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [link 10].
Cybercriminals have evolved their deceptive tactics to focus on tax professionals where they can steal client data.
Should PA-10 tax professionals have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact [link 11] our Washington or District Offices.
*PA-10 Goes for Gold* PA-10 has two athletes competng in the Winter Olympics.
"Congratulations to figure skater Adam Rippon [link 12] and luger Jayson Terdiman [link 13] who are going for the gold in PyeongChang, South Korea."
"Mr. Rippon, a native of Clarks Summit, qualified for his first Olympic team after being sidelined for five months due to injury."
"Two years ago, he was senior Men's national figure skating champion."
"Mr. Terdiman, who hails from Berwick, took part in the 2014 Sochi Olympcis and this year will compete in the Men's Doubles event."
All of Pennsylvania is rooting for you and cheering you on from home!

"Last week, I hosted a bipartisan BBQ lunch with my friend, Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, highlighting in a fun way our bipartisan bill to get rid of ""pork-barrel"" spending in Congress by permanently banning earmarks."
"And I personally attribute the event's success to some very special sauce... Earmarks are the swampiest of swamp creatures, and they're notorious for their secrecy and their lack of oversight and accountability."
"They allow politicians to award pet projects based on political influence instead of merit, and that's just hogwash."
"Taxpayer dollars shouldn't be doled out in secretno ""ifs,"" ""ands,"" or ""pork butts"" about it."
"Watch a few minutes of my bipartisan lunch with Senator Flake as we answer questions about our fight to permanently ban earmarks: Getting rid of earmarks has been an ongoing battle here in the Senate, and one I'm proud to keep fighting for alongside Senator Flake."
Elected officials shouldn't need bribes to do the jobs they were elected to do.

"Thanks for reading,  Jim Banks Member of Congress Indiana's Third District Supporting Increase in BHA for Members of 122nd This week, I joined my Hoosiercolleagues Senator Todd Youngand Senator Joe Donnellyin urging the U.S. Department of Defenseto consider increasing the militarys basic allowance for housing in the Fort Wayne area."
More than 200 Hoosiers from the 122nd Fighter Wing may be receiving housing allowances that are too low based on the cost of living in the Fort Wayne military housing area.
"Standing with Iranian People On Tuesday, the House passed a resolutioncondemning the government of Iran for its violence against demonstrators and calling for a peaceful resolution to the concerns of the citizens of Iran."
Its important for freedom-loving countries around the world to stand with the Iranian people in their pursuit of reform and protection of basic human rights.
"The passage of this resolution sends a clear message to the Iranian regime that America supports the citizens of Iran and their right to free expression.I introduced a similar resolution last week, and the full text of themy resolution can be found   CongressMust Permanently Bury Earmarks All members of Congress must stand united against wasteful government spending.For years, the use ofearmarks was abused by many lawmakers to fundpet projects in their districts at the expense oftaxpayers across the country.Congress voted to ban the use of earmarks in 2011, and when some members of Congress pushed for their return last year, Speaker Ryan pledged to revisit the issue later through a transparent debate."
"To his credit, the Speaker's leadership at that time helped avert a bad decision."
Lifting the earmark banwould be a disservice to the American taxpayer and a major step backward in our fight for fiscal responsibility.
I am hopeful that the upcoming conversation on this subjectwill lead to Congress burying earmarks for good.
Bringing back the earmark gravy train is the opposite of draining the swamp.

"*Wicker Chairs Hearing on Artificial Intelligence* *Congress Explores Future of Machine Learning* What exactly is artificial intelligence, and what does it mean for how we live and work?"
"That was the topic of discussion at a recent hearing I chaired on ""Digital Decision-Making,"" held before the Senate subcommittee that oversees Internet and telecommunications issues."
"Artificial intelligence, often referred to as AI, might sound straight out of a science fiction book or TV show, but it is becoming an increasingly common, if not instrumental, part of everyday life."
"AI is the technology that enables a machine to make a decision based on the data it has collected, such as when a smartphone gives driving directions around congested traffic or an e-mail system detects spam messages."
"Social media, online shopping, and preventing credit card fraud all have AI components."
"The applications are widespread, and the technology is evolving swiftly, creating a need for conversations to ensure it is being used safely and responsibly."
"The experts who testified at the hearing detailed how AI is being harnessed to improve ways farmers grow crops, doctors treat illnesses, manufacturers produce goods, and teachers give feedback to students."
"There are revolutionary, headline-grabbing AI breakthroughs such as self-driving cars, but there are also much more subtle public and private sector advancements in AI that are working to cut costs, boost productivity, and create better lives for Americans."
"*MSU Working on Robots for Law Enforcement, Therapy* A lot of that work is being done in Mississippi."
"One of the hearing's witnesses was Dr. Cindy L. Bethel, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Mississippi State University."
"In her testimony, she noted three specific AI projects at the university."
One is using AI research for robots that could help law enforcement respond to dangerous situations.
The robots would collect information about the crime scene before officers have to put themselves in harm's way.
"Another project is focusing on an autonomous transport system for cargo, and a third is developing a robotic therapy dog, which could be used by those who are allergic to pets."
"Likewise, for the past two years, the University of Mississippi has held a Tech Summit to engage students, faculty, industry experts, business executives, and policymakers on the future of technology in our state and nation."
The forum reaffirms Mississippi's reputation as a place for innovation and illustrates the commitment of our universities to help lead the way.
"*Software Industry Delivers Jobs, Economic Benefits in Miss."
* Advancements in AI could have a major impact on the careers available to tomorrow's workforce.
I am a strong advocate of STEM education and authored a bill earlier this year to promote computer science programs.
"The field is ripe for young talent, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expecting 1.3 million job openings in computing by 2022."
"During the subcommittee hearing, Victoria Espinel, chief executive officer of The Software Alliance, noted that the software industry supports 7,000 jobs and generates more than $800 million in Mississippi."
"This is an exciting time for our state, and I look forward to seeing how AI can continue to transform our communities in positive ways."
The possibilities are truly limitless.

" Dear Lindsey, Washington is broken."
There is no doubt about it.
"Last week, I was handed a 479-page tax bill just hours before it was scheduled for a final vote."
"A small group of senators wrote this disastrous scheme behind closed doors with no input from the public, and they gave nobody time to read it."
The bill included last-minute additions scribbled in the margins that nobody could read.
"As we began voting on amendments, folks were finding secret pet projects and sweetheart deals that were snuck into the bill at the very last minute."
That was Washington at its worst.
Our nations founders must have been turning in their graves.
My job is to hold Washington accountable to Montana.
"Thats why on the Senate Banking Committee, I am working closely with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to rise above the dysfunction."
"After months of negotiations with folks from both parties, we struck a deal on a major bill that delivers much-needed relief to Montana from Washingtons one-size-fits-all regulations."
"Our bipartisan legislation will cut red tape for small community banks and credit unions and it increase access to capital for local businesses, farmers and ranchers, and families."
It also strengthens consumer protections against Wall Street.
"Our bill is bringing folks from all walks of life and political parties together, and it is forging a new path of bipartisanship in the Senate."
"On Tuesday, we held a committee meeting to discuss and make changes to the bill, which lasted over 6 hours."
"That is how it is supposed to work in Washington: open, fair debate in the light of dayon a bill everyone is allowed to discuss."
Our process drafting this bill has been transparent and our bill is posted online HERE for all to see.
None of that was true about the unpopular tax reform bill that will add another $1.5 trillion to the national debt.
"Last week, we saw how partisan Washington can be."
   Helping our Neighbors This week I stopped by the Enfield Food Shelf to see first-hand the work that local volunteers are doing to help friends and neighbors in the community.
"There, I helped hand out turkeys and met with some volunteers."
"Over the last few days, theyve seen hundreds of people come for some extra help this Thanksgiving for their families, and even their pets."
Thank you to all those in Enfield -- and communities across eastern Connecticut -- who are helping to make this holiday a little brighter for their neighbors.
"Handing out turkeys with volunteers at the Enfield Food Shelf      Meeting the New Navy Secretary I recently met with our newest Navy Secretary, Richard V. Spencer."
Secretary Spencer is a Connecticut native with long ties to our region -- his father worked at Electric Boat in the 1940s.
"Although we have spoken by phone a few times since he was confirmed, this was our first chance to talk face-to-face and discuss the challenges facing our Navy."
"In our meeting, we talked about a range of issues that we are grappling with on the Seapower subcommittee -- expanding the Navy surface and undersea fleet, increasing capabilities of our ships and following through on the changes needed in light of the ship collisions earlier this year."
"I appreciated his candor and willingness to engage with me as ranking member of the subcommittee, and look forward to working with him."
"I also invited Secretary Spencer to come visit eastern Connecticut to see firsthand the outstanding work that our sailors at Submarine Base New London, as well as the talented workforce at Electric Boat, do every single day to support our Navy."
"He committed to visiting, and I hope he can make it up soon!"
"Meeting with Navy Secretary Spencer in my Washington, D.C. office          Blue Ribbon Honors for Eastern Connecticut Schools In September, our region got the good news that three schools in eastern Connecticut were recognized as Blue Ribbon schools by the federal Department of Education: East Lyme High School, Thomas W. Mahan Elementary School in Norwich, and the Oakdale Elementary School in Montville."
"This award, granted by the United States Department of Education, honors schools demonstrating high achievement."
"These schools were three of the five honored from Connecticut this year, and among the the 342 across the country to receive the Blue Ribbon."
"Unfortunately, the team at Mahan Elementary in Norwich did not have the budget to send anyone to Washington to receive their award -- so I stopped by this week to present it to them."
"During my visit, I visited classrooms and got some great questions from the students."
More importantly I got to see firsthand the work that had earned the school this well-deserved recognition.
Congratulations to all of those that have worked so hard to ensure that our children receive the best education possible.
"Celebrating the Blue Ribbon designation at Mahan Elementary in Norwich       Thank you, as always, for reading this update."
"THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT This week, House Republicans introduced the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the House Republicans tax relief plan."
This legislation will finally deliver relief from America's antiquated and overly burdensome tax code which I believe is the greatest threat to economic opportunity in this country.
"Most importantly, this plan will give middle-class American families, on average, a $1,182 tax cut."
I have been asking families across the First District what they would do with the hard-earned dollars our plan would let Americans keep from their paychecks.
"They told me they will help their families, give back to their communities, or invest in their businesses and create jobs."
This plan will empower all Americans to achieve the American Dream and I am excited to work with my colleagues to finalize the largest reform of our tax code in more than thirty years.
"Among other tax relief measures, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle- income Americans to Zero, 12%, 25%, and 35% while continuing to maintain 39.6% for high-income Americans; Significantly increases the standard deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples; Eliminates special-interest deductions; Establishes a new Family Credit, which includes expanding the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600; Preserves the Earned Income Tax Credit and the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages and maintains the home mortgage deduction for newly purchased homes up to $500,000; Lowers the corporate rate to 20%, down from 35%; and, Reduces the tax rate on small business to no more than 25% - the lowest tax rate on small business income since World War II."
"To learn more about the legislation or to read it for yourself, click here."
"THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM This week, the House passed the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act with my support."
The legislation extends the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for five years.
"I am glad this legislation passed the House this week, but we're over a month late in reauthorizing the program while the families of 9 million children are holding their breath to see whether their kids are going to have health insurance."
"The reason we are so delayed is because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle asked us to delay, and in good faith, we did."
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided to delay our efforts to pass the bill out of the Energy and Commerce Committee and they decided to delay bringing the bill to the floor for a vote.
"I would hope they have a good reason for these delaying tactics, but the truth is that they opposed a provision requested by President Obama in his fiscal year 2013 - fiscal year 2017 budgets that has a minor impact on the highest earners under Medicare."
This is politics at its worst.
I hope the Senate will act swiftly on this legislation.
"The more than 232,000 children in Georgia who rely on CHIP for their health insurance are depending on it."
"FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CXXXVIII Monday, October 30, 2017: I wake up this morning in Bridgewater, New Jersey, after having flown here yesterday from Savannah."
"Im here to visit with Sanofi, a worldwide leader in pharmaceutical manufacturing and life sciences."
"As a pharmacist, I am very familiar with the company as I have dispensed many of their products throughout my professional career."
My first meeting is with the executive leadership team as they bring me up to date with issues impacting their business and challenges they face in the health care marketplace.
"Afterwards, I have the honor of addressing their employees to bring them up to date on Washington issues, particularly health care, and participate in a question and answer session."
"Next, I head to Swedesboro, New Jersey, where I tour Wedgewood Pharmacy, one of the largest compounding pharmacies in the United States."
"Although they serve the human health market, their main emphasis is the veterinary market where they have made over 7,500 different preparations for companion animals like dogs, cats, birds and horses as well as some less common like hippopotamuses and reptiles."
During my visit I asked one of the pharmacists what was the most unusual animal for which she had ever prepared a medication.
Her response was that they once filled a prescription for a pet dolphin!
I forgot to ask if its name was Flipper.
"Afterwards, I head to Philadelphia where I take a flight to Atlanta to attend the Georgia Republican Partys Annual Chairmans Dinner with guest speaker Dr. Ben Carson, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development."

"          Home  About Ken  About Our District  News  Contact                Weekly Newsletter Dear Friend, I've had a busy October, but I wanted to take a chance to update you on what's happening in Washington."
"Protecting America's Energy Infrastructure I led a bi-partisan letter, signed by 84 of my colleagues, asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the Department of Justice's efforts to prosecute individuals who engage in criminal activity against our energy infrastructure."
Environmental extremists have been open about their intentions to damage energy infrastructure and to harm the individuals who work in that industry.
I will always support Americans' First Amendment right to protest.
But destruction of property and violence against individuals are both illegal and potentially fatal.The Americans who live around and rely daily on this infrastructure deserve the opportunity to feel safe in their homes.
Restoring Article I Powers to Congress  I voted for H.R.
"469,legislation that shores up legislative branch power in a few ways."
"It gives job creators and state regulators the ability to participate in the process of creating new regulations, so that the Judicial Branch alone is not crafting new regulations through litigation proceedings."
"It requires the Treasury Department to be more transparent about the ways in which Judgement Fund dollars are dispensed, ensuring court judgements and settlements don't end up in the hands of state sponsors of terror."
And it improves the process for Congress to intervene in court cases that bring into question the constitutional powers of the Legislative Branch.
469 helps to reassert the Constitutional powers of Congress.
"Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act    I voted for the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act, important legislation that ends a practice of the previous administration where, in my opinion, the Department of Justice required donations to liberal, third-party, outside groups as part of settlement agreements, basically using these settlements to fund its pet political causes instead of returning those dollars to actual lawsuit victims or the taxpayer."
No DOJ should ever have the opportunity to use settlements for political gain.
Im thankful Attorney General Sessions has ended this practice.
732 allows us to permanently abolish this practice.
Simple and Fair Tax Reform The House will soon release its tax reform plan.
I'm eager to review the package and offer feedback on behalf of 4th Congressional District voters.
"If you have thoughts about tax reform, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office to share them with me."
You can visit my website to send an email or you can call my office.
"No matter what, I will be fighting for a tax code that is both simple and fair."
"Letter on Amazon's Second Headquarters to Colorado I joined the rest of the Colorado U.S. House delegation in encouraging Amazon to locate their second headquarters, coming with 50,000 jobs, in our state."
"Our state has much to offer, and the letter provided a chance for us to promote Colorado's incredible living environment."
"Our outdoor recreation opportunities, strong education system, dynamic employers, moderate cost of living, wealth of energy sources, and strong transportation infrastructure all incentivize employers to locate their businesses in this beautiful state."
"Helping Veterans Back in Colorado, I had the opportunity to sit down with several veterans who have struggled to receive the care they need from an overly bureaucratic, poorly managed Veterans Affairs Administration."
Many of their stories were simply heartbreaking.
"These individuals paid a cost to defend our nation, and now they barely receive the healthcare they need."
"My office is working hard to resolve their individual cases, but I'm also pushing in Congress forreforms that provide better care and greater choice for all our heroes."
I met with veterans who have faced red tape and poor care through the Veterans Affairs Administration.
"As always, for more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me onFacebook,Twitter, andInstagram."
"[cid:image001.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] Snow in Detroit Lakes this morning Dear Friends, The ongoing opioid crisis in our country has devastated families and rural communities and it is past time for strong action to be taken to keep our communities safe and healthy."
"This week, I worked to call attention to the continuing need for solutions to combat drug abuse."
"I joined Senator Klobuchar at a roundtable discussion in Thief River Falls last Friday to hear from local health professionals on treatment programs, and talked to Joel Heitkamp on KFGO News and Views Thursday morning to talk about effective policies that combat addiction."
This issue will continue to grow unless we work together to find long-term solutions.
You can read more about the issue in my letter-to-the-editor that was sent to local newspapers around the Seventh.

"Opioid abuse continues to be a large-scale problem in our communities, and I am committed to finding workable solutions to combat this issue."
"National Sheriffs' Association [cid:image004.png@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] John Thompson, Deputy Executive Director On Tuesday, I met with John Thompson of the National Sheriffs' Association and discussed the importance of allowing domestic violence victims to bring their pets with them to shelters."
Pets are members of the family and can provide great comfort to domestic violence victims.
"Currently, most shelters do not have the resources to house pets, but I fully support legislation that would give shelters access to grants to build pet amenities."
"Minnesota Telecom Alliance [cid:image005.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] This week, the Minnesota Telecom Alliance (MTA) visited my office to thank me for leading a letter urging the FCC to address the budget shortfall in the High-Cost Universal Service Fund (USF)."
A lack of sufficient funding for rural broadband development continues to put millions of Americans at a significant disadvantage.
"I appreciate the perspective of MTA as Congress works to connect rural residents, businesses, producers, and providers to each other and the world."

"Representing the needs of my constituents remains my top priority, and I'm appreciative of all who came out to talk about how we can best support our farmers and growers."
Radio Interview with KFGO [cid:image007.png@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] I was a guest on KFGO News and Views with Joel Heitkamp on Thursday morning to talk about how the United States is facing an unprecedented opioid epidemic.

Felling Trailers [cid:image008.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80] My staff met with members of the National Association of Trailer Manufacturers (NATM) this week.
Pat Joenniseen of Felling Trailers in Sauk Centre highlighted the recurring challenges of finding and hiring skilled workers.
"In order for our businesses to expand, they need assurance that there will be skilled workers to hire."
This is a common fear I hear from business owners in Minnesota.
"Being that this is a problem fairly unique to Minnesota, we should first look for a solution at the local level."
"A coordinated effort by the state, schools, unions, and businesses will be required in order to solve our shortage of skilled workers."
I look forward to continuing conversations on supporting our local businesses.

"[cid:image012.jpg@01D34F3F.05ABDE80]Legislative Update This week, the House passed two pieces of legislation targeted at increasing transparency in federal government settlements and to stop the ""sue and settle"" process of agency activism."
"One of these included the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, which I was the lead Democratic sponsor."
"The legislation seeks to stop the practice of the DOJ requiring donations to be directed towards certain groups, often politically motivated, as part of settlements."
"Finally, the House passed the Senate's budget, which I voted against."
"This budget will increase the debt by over $1.5 trillion, and I cannot support a bill so financially irresponsible."

"Each week, the newsletter will feature a landmark or site somewhere in Western Minnesota."
The first person to name the location wins!
The location of the photo as well as the winner will be revealed in the next newsletter.
"                     Thank you for reading my weekly e-newsletter, Ryans Report."
This was a District Work Week and I spent time traveling around our community to make site visits and meet with constituents.
"I took this photo along the way: French Creek at Sheeder Hall Bridge, East  West Vincent Township, Chester County Since coming to office in 2015, I have heard from constituents, first responders, treatment facility officials, nurses, doctors, and many others who are working to combat the opioid epidemic both locally and nationally."
"I have utilized their feedback and worked to fight this epidemicthrough legislation, by ensuring first responders and others facing the epidemic on the front lineshave adequate resources, by visiting treatment centers in the community, and by supporting the 21stCentury Cures Act, whichprovided $1 billionin funding for states to fight the opioid epidemic - including $26 million for Pennsylvania alone."
"As you may have read, or seen on 60 Minutes, the intent and focus of legislation regarding the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that was signed into law in 2016 was recently the subject of a Washington Post story.This bipartisan legislation first passed through the Energy and Commerce Committees Health Subcommittee and the full Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously in 2014 and 2015 before it passed both the House and Senate unanimously -in fact, it passed the House unanimously in 2014, 2015, and 2016- and was signed into law by the Obama Administration without any stated objection from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).To be clear,this bill went through regular order, and technical assistance was provided by the DEA and Department of Justice (DOJ).Here is an op-edby Senator Hatch which reflects the facts and the context surrounding passage of the bill."
"The legislations clear and stated intent was to have the DEA and distribution companies establish a clear understanding of enforcement standards, allowing for greater collaboration among stakeholders to address modern challenges to prescription drug abuse, while still allowing patientswith medical needs to have reasonable access."
"I have stated that if the purpose of the law is nownotbeing realized, then we need tofix it."
"I am in the process of investigating and evaluating this, and preparing questions to the DEA to get answers."
"I believe many others are as well, especially given it was unanimously supported by the entire Congress and signed into law by President Obama."
"On Wednesday, October 25, I will have the opportunity to hear directly from the DEA during a full Energy and Commerce Committee hearing."
I will be sure to provide an update from the hearing.
Keep reading for a full update on my week.
October 16  October 20: Local Efforts to Keep Our Community Safe  Healthy Week Without Domestic Violence I joined the YWCA Tri-County on Thursday for its Open House for National Week Without Violence -a nationwide effort to raise awareness on the impact of violence in our communities.
"I believe it is critical toadvocate for healthy and safe communities, which is why I support efforts in Congress on these important issues:  Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act: This legislation reauthorizes the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program, which relies on evidence-based measures by ensuring grantees of the program are making progress in several areas, including improvements in maternal health, improvements in self-sufficiency, reduction of child abuse, and reducing domestic violence."
"Under the bill, states must provide certain information to show this progress."
International Violence Against Women Act: This bill wouldcreate anOffice of Global Womens Issues within the U.S. Department of State.
"In addition, this legislation would establish a Senior Coordinator for Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)."
"If enacted, these programs would be directed to coordinate U.S. foreign policy with respect to the global prevention of violence against women and girls."
"This legislation would help promote gender integration on an international scale, especially in countries where women are denied basic human rights, starved of opportunity, and unjustly targeted as victims of discrimination and abuse."
"PAWS Act: This bill would amend federal criminal law to include threats or acts of violence against an individuals pet under the offenses of stalking and interstate violation of a protection order.In addition, this legislation would authorize the U.S. Department of Agriculture to award grants to local stakeholders to develop programs to provide housing assistance, support services, and training for victims of domestic violence and their pets."
"I also sent a bipartisan letter with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-MI) to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, urging her to maintain Title IX guidance in K-12 schools that protects young people from sexual assault and harassment."
"Our schools must be prepared to protect students from sexual assault and violence, which is why maintaining current guidance to make sure schools know their responsibilities and commit to them is so important."
"The lasting consequences for victims of sexual assault can be wide-ranging, which is just one of the reasons why we must ensure schools support completing training and education to provide an environment safe from sexual violence."
You can read the letter here.
"When Secretary DeVos announced the Department would rescind Title IX guidance, I issued the following statement: At the very least, parents expect Pennsylvanias K-12 schools, colleges, and universities to be safe learning environments for our students, and Title IX helps uphold this standard."
Any threats to a safe and healthy learning environment  especially sexual misconduct  must be taken seriously and addressed swiftly and fairly.
I am concerned by Secretary DeVos' decision today to formally rescind the 2011 Title IX guidance document issued by the Department of Education that protects young people from sexual assault and harassment.
I will continue paying close attention to the Departments actions as it reevaluates existing guidance to improve due process under the law.
"Any new guidance must maintain strong protections for victims, further clarify the responsibilities of schools under Title IX, and more effectively prevent sexual assault on campus."
"Infrastructure In Our Community  This week, I visited Poplar Neck Bridge in Cumru Township to meet with officials from the American Public Works Association (APWA) and local officials about infrastructure needs."
"In Congress, I co-chair the Public Works and Infrastructure Caucus  a bipartisan forum to advance discussion and efforts on the need for greater investment in our nations infrastructure, including public works."
I believe our Caucus can play a vital role in advocating for a comprehensive infrastructure package and serving as a strong advocate for public works throughout that process.
"Public works professionals are the first line of defense in weather emergencies and natural disaster to make sure our roads are safe and clear for first responders  and who provide vital services we all depend on day in and day out, regardless of where we live."
"Equifax Update As I continue to hear from constituents affected or concerned by the data breach at Equifax, caseworkers at my offices in West Chester and Wyomissing are available to provide assistance for residents of Pennsylvania's Sixth Congressional District."
"As a reminder, you may also visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website for assistance by clicking here."
"I am alsocontinuing to work on this issue in Congress: This week,along with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Isenta letter to the General Services Administration(GSA) requesting information on GSAs data security evaluations when considering and awarding federal contracts.The Committee was made aware GSA had previously awarded federal contracts to Equifax, including for data work with the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."
"Companies that handle consumers personal information as part of their work with the federal government must demonstrate an ability to protect this sensitive information as part of the contract application process - no excuses.Similarly, federal agencies vetting potential contractors should have a strong confidence in those companies ability to securely guard such information."
I also recently signed onto a letter sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that questioned the decision by the IRS to continue its contract for data services with Equifax even after the breach.
The IRS has since suspended the contract.

"October: Breast Cancer Awareness Month This year, approximately 246,600 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer."
"In Pennsylvania, approximately30 new cases are diagnosed each day.With the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimating that 1 in 8 women will receive a breast cancer diagnosis at some point during her lifetime, we all know someone who has been affected."
"As we recognizeBreast Cancer Awareness Monththis October as part of the nationwide effort to support those who have been impacted by breast cancer and to raise awareness to improve early detection, I wanted to tell you about my efforts in Congress to combat this disease:  Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act:This bill would take steps to identify opportunities and ideas within government and the private sector that have not yet been utilized but could be very helpful in the work to end breast cancer."
Breast Cancer Patient Education Act: This bill would take steps to better inform breast cancer patients of treatment and recover options.
"Protecting Access to Lifesaving Screenings (PALS) Act: This bill would help women maintain access to essential breast cancer screenings, regardless of their age."
I have also worked to gain the support of a bipartisan group of my colleagues to advocate for robust funding for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program during the appropriations process and will be sure to share the letter with you once it has been sent.
"Next week, the House will be in session for votes, Committee business, and constituent meetings."

"""What are your thoughts on this plan?I support parts of the plan, but I still want to see the Affordable Care Act (ACA) repealed and replaced."
"I support parts of the plan and believe additional fixes are necessary, but we should keep the ACA."
"I support parts of the plan, but I still believe single-payer is the way forward."
I do not support any parts of the plan announced this week and believe the only solution is to repeal and replace the ACA.
I do not support any parts of the plan announced this week and believe the only solution is a single payer healthcare system.
I do not support any changes to the ACA.

                                    Congress Must Repeal a Bad Law Fueling Americas Opioid Crisis    Union members protest pharmaceutical company profits from opioid shipments that fall into the wrong hands.
"Dear Friend,  Opioid pain killer abuse kills some 33,000 Americans every year, and Im strongly supporting legislation to immediately repeal a bad law that has made the opioid crisis even worse."
"Under the guise of ensuring adequate supplies to patients who actually require these powerful medications, the 2016 law has made it tougher for federal enforcement agencies to crack down on drug companies and distributors that ship opioids illegally to turn huge profits."
"According to a blockbuster investigation by the Washington Post and 60 Minutes, these shipments have flooded areas of the Nation hardest hit by the opioid abuse epidemic."
"So in addition to repealing the 2016 law, our new measure restores the federal Drug Enforcement Agencys (DEA) full authority to suspend the licenses of unscrupulous distributors of opioids and other prescription drugs."
"Last week, President Trumps nominee to be the Nations Drug Czar, Republican Congressman Tom Marino, was forced to withdraw from consideration following news reports that he had received substantial campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industrywhile helping lead the 2016 measure to passage by the House."
"In fact, according to the Post-60 Minutes report, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than $100 million lobbying Congress and delivering campaign contributions between 2014 and 2016."
This is just one more example of the toxic effects of special interest money on our public policymaking process.
Thats why my Restore Democracy legislation calls for getting toxic special interest money out of politics.
We need to restore integrity to a system that has increasingly become rigged for the rich and powerful.
"As this opioid situation so clearly illustrates, bad public policy fueled by special interests and their campaign dollars not only hurts our Nation  but can also cost lives."
The American people deserve better from their elected leaders.
We will keep you posted as events proceed.
"Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts."

"Sincerely,   International Falls Military Veterans Roundtable Highlights Need to Reform Veterans Choice Program   Click on the photo above for a video summary of the packed military Veterans roundtable Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz and I hosted last Friday in International Falls."
"Congressman Walz, to my left in this picture, is the highest ranking enlisted person ever to serve in Congress."
No military Veteran should ever have to make a 600-mile round trip from International Falls to Minneapolis for routine medical care.
"That, in a nutshell, was the message Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz and I heard last week from Veterans Service Officers, health care providers, and military Veterans who attended our Veterans Choice roundtable on Friday in International Falls."
The Veterans Choice program to provide rural military Veterans with top quality local medical care  without having to travel long distances to VA health care facilities  is a great idea.
But Veterans Choice is not working as intended.
Rules and regulations are confusing.
Providers are leaving the system because of trouble getting paid.
And it takes too long to schedule appointments.
"So we need to be bold, creative, and open to new ideas in order to fix Veterans Choice and get it right."
"As we pointed out during the meeting, the Veterans Affairs Administration (VA) has just submitted its latest version of Veterans Choice reform legislation to the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees - an update which is meant to eliminate the current long wait times and distance requirements that have frustrated so many military Veterans and their families."
"Congressman Walz is the Ranking Member (Democratic equivalent of Chairman) of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, and Ill be working closely with him on bipartisan legislation to provide better and more accessible local health care to all our military Veterans in Minnesota and across our Nation."
Military Veterans and their families packed our Veterans Roundtable in International Falls to relay their experiences with the Veterans health care system and advocate for reform of the Veterans Choice program to provide local care in rural areas.
"21st Century Cures Act Just One Step Forward To Better Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment   Wherever I go across Minnesotas rural 8th District, families, patients, community leaders and mental health professionals emphasize the need for more mental health resources for diagnosis, treatment and support."
"By almost any definition, mental health problems here in America have reached epidemic proportion  a major factor in opioid abuse and addiction, alcoholism, domestic abuse, crime, homelessness, unemployment and suicide."
"According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, more than 43 million people experience some kind of mental health issue in any given year."
Make no mistake  we are making progress.
The 21st Century Cures Act signed into law in 2016 contains a provision I cosponsored  the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act  that has been called the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.
"Specifically, the Cures Act provides money and support to better train teachers, law enforcement, and first responders to recognize the symptoms of mental illness and de-escalate crises."
"Thanks to the Cures Act, there are more resources to keep people with mental illnesses out of jail, and more psychiatric hospital beds once they get into treatment."
The law also provides for better oversight of the insurance industry to ensure that mental illnesses are treated like any other medical condition.
"But as I pointed out to the hundreds who attended last weeks Pine County Mental Health Forum in Hinckley, we still have a long way to go to bring mental health issues out into the open, and encourage people to seek treatment."
Only about 40 percent of the people who need treatment actually receive it.
"According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, that figure translates into annual lost earnings topping $193 billion."
"And tragically, more than 90 percent of young people who die by suicide have a mental health condition."
"Wherever I go across Minnesotas rural 8th District, families, patients, community leaders and mental health professionals emphasize the need for more mental health resources for diagnosis, treatment and support."
"And more bed and facilities for people in crisis, so they can be treated close to home near their families and loved ones."
That will be my focus in Congress as we strive to make life better for people who are troubled and in need.
"Paws  Claws in Hackensack Joins Nationwide Rescue of Pets Made Homeless by Hurricanes   At the Paws and Claws Rescue and Resort in Hackensack, owners Betty and Jack Thomas introduced me to Bruiser, a boxer mix puppy displaced when Hurricane Harvey struck Texas earlier this fall."
"This falls devastating hurricanes have left countless numbers of pets homeless, and Betty and Jack Thomas, owners of the Paws and Claws Rescue  Resort in Hackensack, have joined folks all over the country to help them out."
"In addition to providing adoption, foster care and boarding for local dogs and cats, as well as volunteer, educational, and employment opportunities for Cass County animal lovers, Betty and Jack have accepted ten dogs separated for their families when Hurricane Harvey struck Texas."
"When I visited Paws and Claws last week, Betty and Jack introduced me to the little guy in the photo above."
"His name is Bruiser, and hes a boxer mix puppy."
And hes also a reminder of the lasting damage that terrible storms bring upon communities.
"Though the hurricanes have past, an incredible amount of work needs to be done."
"And as I have pointed out before, Congress must immediately provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with all of the resources and support necessary to help restore Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida."
"Tens of thousands of people are still struggling to rebuild their homes, regain access to power and clean drinking water and - for some - to find their lost pets."
"Thanks to Betty and Jack and folks like them, thousands of homeless pets are finding safe haven, and as many as possible are being reunited with their families."

GOP Opens the Way for $1.5 Trillion Tax Boondoggle to Make the Rich Even Richer - Working Families Would Pay the Bill   House and Senate Republicans have passed a budget resolution that opens the way for an enormous tax cut for super-wealthy individuals and corporations - paid for by working families.
"Republicans leaders have again demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to hand millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations a $1.5 trillion tax cut paid for by working families."
"Paving the way for the GOPs phony so-called tax reform bill, Senate Republicans last week passed a $4 trillion budget resolution that would blow up the deficit and roll back Social Security, Medicare, and an entire century of American progress."
"On the chopping block are good paying jobs, clean air and water, lifesaving medical research, pensions and retirement benefits, health care and transportation  just to name a few."
"As I have pointed out before, the Republican budget plan sets the stage for dismantling Social Security and Medicare - turning Social Security over to Wall Street bankers and Medicare over to the costly private insurance industry."
"Medicare benefits would be cut by half a trillion dollars.And Medicaid  which millions of elderly nursing home patients, disabled children, rural hospitals and others depend on for support  would be decimated with a trillion dollar cut."
"Now the GOP Senate measure goes back to the House, where Republican leaders will do their utmost to rubber stamp it."
Mark my words  I will continue to fight this every step of the way.
"And Ill be working for a much better budget that invests in America, in people and good paying jobs, and in opportunities for the middle class."
Our Week in Cook   It was a tremendous honor for me to present 96-year-old World War II Navy Veteran Leo Hiveley with several medals he earned in service to our Nation.
The medal pinning ceremony took place at the Cook VFW on Friday afternoon.
"A mix-up way back in 1945prevented Leo from receiving the honors at that time, and Im so proud that our Congressional office was instrumental inrectifying the situation so he could receive them in front of so many friends and members of his family."
Our Week in Minneapolis   My daughter Katherine and I were honored to represent A Breath of Hope Lung Foundation at a special luncheon sponsored by the Minnesota Vikings and the American Cancer Society to honor cancer survivors and caregivers.

"Our Week in International Falls   Before our Veterans Roundtable with Congressman Tim Walz, I sat down for an interview with host Duane Etienne at KSDM/KGSM Radio."
"During our tour of the beautiful new terminal at International Falls Airport, I had the opportunity to meet with the TSA Homeland Security agents who do such great work to ensure the safety of passengers and employees alike."
"Im proud to say that our office helped secure $3 million in federal funding for this facility, which will help boost good paying jobs, commerce and tourism throughout the Borderland."
"Our Week in Blackduck   We enjoyed a warm welcome from the 300 employee owners of Anderson Fabrics, Blackducks largest employer - and the largest custom fabrics design and craft center in the Nation."
Blackduck Mayor Rudy Patch and City Administrator Christina Regas joined us on Thursday afternoon for the tour.
"Our Week in Crosby   Im working hard in Congress to increase funding for medical research to help better diagnose, treat and ultimately find a cure for Type 1 Diabetes."
"So it was a real inspiration to meet with Crow Wing Commissioner Doug Houge, who has launched the Because of Brandon campaign to help find a cure and boost awareness of this condition."
"Doug lost his son, Brandon, to type 1 diabetes in 2015."
"For the past two years, he has worked to raise more than $90,000 to send children with this disease to a special summer camp, and to help parents transport their kids to doctor visits in the Twin Cities."
"Doug is pictured here along with Jayce, a Type 1 Diabetes survivor who is helping advance the Because of Brandon organization."
Our Week in Duluth   The Duluth Chamber of Commerces 147th Annual Meeting on Thursday night.
"The speaker was our friend Khawar Nasim, Consul General of Canada stationed in Minneapolis."
Mr. Nasim spoke about the important trade relationship that Canada and the United States share.
Canada is Minnesotas largest trading partner.
"Anyone who spends anytime in Duluth, on the Iron Range or North Shore, has seen all of those Canadian license plates and knows what a positive impact our friends to the North have on our economy."
"When we talk about fair trade and free trade, we need to make sure we protect our good relationship with Canada."
"Our district director, Jeff Anderson, attended the event on my behalf."
"Members of the Baha'i in the Northland gathered over the weekend to celebrate the 200th anniversary of their faith, and Nolan Congressional staffer Brynn Sias joined them on my behalf."
I was proud to co-sponsor a House Resolution this year condemning the Government of Iran for their state-sponsored persecution of their Baha'i minority.

"*Last week's answer:* The AMT was created in 1969 following the public outrage that ensued after then-Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr informed Congress that 155 taxpayers with incomes exceeding $200,000 had paid no federal income tax in 1966."
"Between 1979 and the late 1990s, only a few hundred thousand taxpayers were affected."
The problem is that it was never indexed and now captures millions of middle-class families in its web.
"As the Tax Policy Center [link 27] notes, ""originally intended to prevent perceived abuses by a handful of the very rich, it now affects roughly 5 million filers."""

"Sabotage with a Pen Even though he has majorities in both the House and the Senate, President Trump was unable to pass legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."
"Instead, on Thursday he sought to undermine and destroy the ACA through Executive Order."
"While urging an end to the ""employer mandate"" which requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health coverage at group rates, Trump advanced Association Health Plans (AHPs) where small businesses or other entities could buy health insurance."
He claims this will lower premiums.
"Maybe it will, but not surprisingly, Trump is oversimplifying and leaving out some crucial facts."
AHPs could be a reasonable addition to the overall health care discussion.
The problem here is that the AHPs Trump will allow would be under no obligation to cover essential benefits as required by the ACA.
Essential benefits include everything from pre-natal and postpartum care to mental health and substance abuse treatment.
There would also be no obligation to cover pre-existing conditions.
This includes anything from asthma and high blood pressure to a previous cancer diagnosis.
Younger healthier people may opt for lower premiums and less coverage but if they are faced with accident or illness that coverage won't be enough.
Older people or those with disabilities or chronic conditions would be forced into more expensive plans.
President Trump also announced late yesterday that the Administration would stop the payments to health insurance companies that help low-income individuals afford coverage.
"In rejecting this Cost-Sharing Reduction Program (CSR), Trump is again seeking to sabotage the ACA because he has been so ineffective legislatively."
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has concluded that stopping these payments will increase health insurance premiums by 20% for many Americans next year alone and increase the federal deficit by $6 billion in 2018.
Some companies may also stop participating in the insurance marketplaces because of the volatility.
"Interestingly, most of this negative impact will occur in the states that voted for Trump!"
"This morning Trump tweeted: ""The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding."
Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped.
"Dems should call me to fix!"""
"So the President takes a hammer to health care for millions of Americans, including many who voted for him, then calls on Democrats to ""fix"" it."
To me - this is the height of hypocrisy and irony!
"Making America Small Again Today, Trump refused to certify that Iran is living up to their side of the Iran Nuclear Agreement."
That is the agreement supported by the ENTIRE WORLD that moved Iran away from building nuclear weapons.
This refusal does not itself break the agreement and no one expects Iran will start building nuclear bombs soon.
"The rest of the world - including ALL of our allies like Britain, France and Germany, and all of our adversaries like Russia and China - have stated their belief that Iran is living up to the deal and their intention to stay true to the agreement."
"However, Trump does open the door for Congress to take action that might undermine the agreement further and, thereby, challenge Iran to either submit to Trump's unilateral demands or start building bombs."
Time will tell if Congress will act foolishly and endanger the world.
Trump's action also undermines America's role in the world.
"Little by little Trump has thumbed his nose at virtually every other country, including our closest allies, and withdrawn from the position we have earned as leader of the free world."
His reckless and unilateral actions have grave consequences.
"Much of the world will come to believe they do not need the USA, cannot trust the USA to stay true to its word, and have, therefore, no good reason to cooperate with us or pay attention to our concerns."
How can anyone see this as a good result?
I expect to have more to say on this matter as events unfold.
"More Outrageous Tweets Although I believe President Trump's daily Tweets are primarily intended to distract us from more important business, some of his recent statements I think demand a response."
Trump is mad at NBC News for reporting he called for a vast increase in the United States' nuclear arsenal during a summer White House meeting.
"This is the gathering that prompted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to reportedly call the President a ""moron"" based on his lack of knowledge and understanding about nuclear weapons in today's world."
One of his Tweets called out the network and raised the possibility of revoking its broadcast license.
This is an outrageous attack on the First Amendment by a sitting President.
I am occasionally angered by the media and I think they deserve to be called out when they are wrong or misleading - but every American must accept that the press has a vital role to play in our democracy.
"Trump took an oath to uphold the Constitution and whether he likes it or not, he has an obligation not only to support, but to champion a free press."
Empty threats that clearly violate basic rights protected by the Constitution undermine the Office of the President and offend basic American values.
Trump was busy Thursday morning.
"His threats to essentially abandon Puerto Rico, devastated by Hurricane Maria, are cruel, unconscionable and beneath the dignity of the office he holds."
3.4 million American citizens are struggling to rebuild their lives.
Far too many still lack access to clean water and electricity.
Medical supplies are scarce and many roads still not operational.
"In yet another fit of Twitter pique, Trump rants that the United States can't stay and help ""forever"" when it's been just three weeks."
This is both a moral failure and an appalling lack of leadership.
I wish I could tell you I'm surprised.
Disaster Aid Yesterday the House passed the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R.
"2266, Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act."
It provides emergency aid for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and additional relief for other areas devastated by the recent hurricanes.
2266 also includes aid for California where residents are battling deadly wildfires.
"It's not enough, and our fellow citizens will need our support for many months, but it is a necessary down payment."
"2266 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 164 69 0 6 DEMOCRAT 189 0 0 5 TOTAL 353 69 0 11 MASSACHUSETTS 9 0 0 0 Whistleblower Protection Yesterday the House considered S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017."
This legislation increases protections for federal whistle blowers by requiring agency leaders to strengthen disciplinary action when it is determined that supervisors have retaliated against them.

"If you need to catch up or share with friends, you can find the full list here."
"169: According to October 2017 news reports, the Department of Justice overruled decades of precedent in January, making it possible for President Trump to hire his daughter and son-in-law."
"Memos from the administrations of Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan and Obama make clear that under a 1967 nepotism law, Presidents cannot appoint their family members to any paid or unpaid positions."
"The Trump Administration's Justice Department basically threw out all previous legal guidance on nepotism, making it possible for Trump to hire daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, which he did."
"On October 5, 2017 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) disagreed with the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) decision to allow Equifax to serve as an interim fraud prevention contractor for the federal government."
Equifax holds the current contract but another company recently won the bid.
Equifax is protesting the loss of the contract and the IRS is now reviewing the process.
The GAO maintains that the IRS could have given the interim contract to the company it chose over Equifax as it reviewed the contract awarding process.
I am sure you recall that Equifax has been in the news quite a bit lately for a data breach that exposed 145 million consumers' personal information to hackers.
Yet the IRS apparently doesn't see the problem with allowing Equifax to continue doing fraud prevention work for the federal government.
The GAO argues that the law gives the IRS the authority to award a contract to the winning bidder even if the current contractor is challenging the process under certain circumstances.
"Certainly, awarding a company that mishandled the personal data of 145 million customers with a fraud prevention contract qualifies."
"UPDATE: As this newsletter was going through the final editing process, news broke that the IRS finally suspended Equifax's government contract."
"During a confirmation hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on October 4, 2017, Michael Dourson, who is President Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, refused to definitively state that he would recuse himself from all matters that would conflict with former employment."
"While this is concerning from an ethical standpoint, it is even more concerning because Dourson founded Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA) where he routinely issued reports favorable to chemical companies."
Some of those reports were paid for by chemical companies and TERA regularly issued findings asserting that safety standards for certain pesticides and chemicals should be much lower than current federal and state regulations.
"It is expected that Dourson will be confirmed by the full Senate, putting him in charge of an office that is involved with protecting the public from pesticide."
"On October 6, 2017 Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued guidance that greatly expands interpretation of the protections granted religious groups and others when their beliefs are at odds with government regulation."
"He wrote: ""To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government action, including employment, contracting and programming."""
"Given this Administration's previous actions, it's not hard to see an abuse of this directive that discriminates against the LGBTQ community and others."
"If an employer does not believe in same sex marriage, the AG has basically given that employer license to reject a candidate solely on that basis."
"On October 9, 2017 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that Administrator Scott Pruitt would take steps to repeal the Clean Power Plan, an Obama Administration rule intended to reduce carbon emissions from power plants."
Abandoning this policy shows a cynical disregard for the reality of global warming.
It also has health consequences.
"During the previous Administration, the EPA estimated that the Clean Power Plan could prevent thousands of deaths and reduce asthma attacks in children."
"In October 2017, the sabotaging of the ACA, as described above."
What's up Next Week A district work period will take place.
The next House votes are scheduled for Monday October 23rd.

"[cid:image001.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Thief River Falls Dear Friends, As Congress begins discussions on the upcoming budget, I continue to visit with Minnesotans about the programs and tax provisions that impact their lives the most."
"As a CPA, I appreciate the importance of making our system easier, and the possibility to strengthen the economy if tax reform is done right."
"The impact of tax reform came up a number of times this week as I met with groups on healthcare, education, agriculture, and small business."
"A few of these groups included the Minnesota Department of Human Resources, the Tri-Valley Opportunity Council, and the National Farmers Union."
"Sincerely, [cid:image002.png@01D33947.414A83A0] Congressman Collin C. Peterson Minnesota 7th District Minnesota Department of Human Resources [cid:image003.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Emily Piper (Commissioner, Minnesota Department of Human Services) Minnesota Department of Human Resources (DHS) Commissioner Emily Piper visited my office Thursday to discuss the recent approval of Minnesota's waiver application to establish a state-based reinsurance program."
"While I am happy that progress is being made to help stabilize the state's individual health insurance market, I am concerned by the recent development that funding for MinnesotaCare will significantly decrease as a result."
I will work closely with Governor Dayton and the Minnesota Delegation to preserve these critical funds while implementing needed changes to our healthcare system.
"Minnesota Rural Electric Association [cid:image004.png@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday, I met with a group of Minnesota Rural Electric Association (MREA) members who represent electric cooperatives across the state."
"The cooperatives provide affordable and reliable electricity, oftentimes to hard-to-reach customers."
MREA dedicates significant transmission line infrastructure in rural Minnesota which provides farmers and businesses with access to much-needed power.
I support the efforts of MREA and will continue to find ways to represent their needs in Congress.
Minnesota Credit Union Network [cid:image005.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Credit unions play an important role in providing the credit rural communities need to thrive.
"The Minnesota Credit Union Network visited my office and shared their concerns with the cost of complying with regulations which were supposed to target the large banks following financial collapse, and also their concerns about the impact tax reform could have on their operations."
"With data security in the news, they shared how the cost of a data breach anywhere in the retail sector can impact lenders and their members."
"We are only as secure as our weakest link, and that is why credit unions favor strong data protection and consumer notification laws for everyone."
"U.S. Army Corps of Engineers This week, I met with the St. Paul District Army Corps of Engineers for an update on projects in the district."
We talked about next steps for Fargo-Moorhead flood protection and the process that will be needed to bring in all stakeholders for a real conversation about solutions.
"With the injunction in place, I believe that trying to resolve this issue through the courts will waste time and divert resources away from the concrete actions that can bring flood protection to Fargo."
"I am confident that at the end of the day, everyone is going to have to give a little, but that the entire region will benefit from bringing flood protection to Fargo."
"As drainage water management and retention projects in the valley move forward, I will continue to work with federal officials to ensure that the flood benefits of these efforts are appropriately considered as a part of the region's flood control strategy."
"National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association [cid:image006.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Minnesotan representatives of the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association were in Washington this week to share their perspective on infrastructure development and tax reform."

Tri-Valley Opportunity Council [cid:image007.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Members of the Tri-Valley Opportunity Council visited my office this week to advocate for the Head Start Program.
"The education and nutrition services that Head Start provides to children in the 7th District also allows their parents to work, contributing to a strong rural economy."
I will continue to support this program in the future.
"National Farmers Union [cid:image008.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, came by my office on Wednesday to discuss his organization's priories for the farm bill."
We discussed the importance of farm programs that appropriately help farmers in difficult times and how we can improve those policies.
I look forward to working with Roger and the rest of Farmers Union to build support for the next farm bill.
"National Association of Wheat Growers [cid:image009.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday, several representatives from the National Association of Wheat Growers, including their president, David Schemm Kansas, met with me to outline their top issues for the farm bill."
We agreed that farm programs should reflect the costs farmers incur when growing their crops and that reference prices need to be equitable for all commodities.
CFTC Commissioner Behnam [cid:image010.png@01D33947.414A83A0] I met with Russ Benham who was sworn in as a new Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) earlier this month.
"We discussed his role on the commission, the upcoming agenda for the year, and how the Commission's policies impact farmers."
"Minnesota Prairie Line Railroad 15 Year Anniversary [cid:image011.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Last Friday, I celebrated with the Minnesota Prairie Line Railroad at their 15-year Anniversary hosted in Franklin."
They have a lot to celebrate as their hard work and investments in the railroad over the years have supported shippers and rural communities with many new economic opportunities.
I appreciate what they have done for rural agriculture and look forward to their continued success.
"Consul General of Canada [cid:image012.png@01D33947.414A83A0] I welcomed Consul General Khawar Nasim to my office on Tuesday to discuss important interplay between Minnesota and our neighbors to the North, particularly as Congress continues discussions on trade reform."
"The US - Canada economic relationship affects Minnesota in many ways, including tourism in the Northwest Angle and our manufacturing and agriculture communities - especially regarding Canada's supply management system in its dairy and poultry sectors."
I look forward to continuing these conversations with General Nasim.
"FDA Duchenne Hearing [cid:image013.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] Cheri, Jacob, and Jon Gunvalson (Gonvick) This week, my staff delivered remarks at an FDA advisory committee hearing in support of the accelerated approval of a drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
"One of my constituents, Jacob Gunvalson, also attended the event to share his experience with the disease and emphasize the urgent need for therapies within the Duchenne community."
"During my time in Congress, I have consistently supported efforts to ensure that others can benefit from life-saving therapies the way that Jacob has."
Ag and Animal Science Conference (AASC) [cid:image014.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday my staff attended the Agriculture and Animal Science Conference in Willmar.
"The one day conference brought together many of the region's agriculture and animal science stakeholders to listen to local start-ups about their businesses along with industry issues such as marketing, pressures related to GMO and non-GMO labeling, changes in generational labor force, and addressing consumer opinions."
The conference brought in engaging speakers and prompted dynamic discussions amongst stakeholders.
Minnewaska Community Health Services [cid:image015.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Thursday morning my staff attended the groundbreaking ceremony for Hoffman's new assisted living and memory care facility.

"Minnewaska Community Health Services has come a long way in developing a regional care network, and I commend the hard work that made it all possible."
"Humane Society [cid:image016.jpg@01D33947.414A83A0] On Tuesday, local volunteers from the Humane Society of the United States visited my Detroit Lakes office to share their priorities for Congress."

"Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Representing the 11th District of New Jersey *The Federal Response to Hurricanes in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands* *Key Cosponsorships* *Congressman Steve Scalise Comes Back to Serve* *Bringing Suicide ""Out of the Darkness""* *Salute: 23 new American citizens* *The Federal Response to Hurricanes in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands* The personal accounts and pictures coming out of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are heartbreaking as the residents struggle in the aftermath of massive Hurricanes Irma and Maria."
The recovery effort has been very active.
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) along with the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and others, are conducting aggressive 24-hour operations, with an array of U.S. government and non-governmental partners, in an ongoing effort to provide immediate assistance to the residents of these two devastated territories."
"According to FEMA, the top priority of the federal government is continuing to provide life sustaining resources to the islands, bringing additional essential commodities in and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports, and other critical facilities."
"There are more than 10,000 federal staff representing 36 departments and agencies, including more than 800 FEMA personnel, on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands engaged in response and recovery operations."
"In Puerto Rico, 56 of 68 hospitals are partially operational, with one fully operational."
Additional *National Disaster Medical System* staff arrived Thursday to support hospital assessments and medical needs of those in Puerto Rico.
"Specific activities in other areas: - Officials in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico opened points of distribution in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for survivors to get meals, water, and other commodities."
"The Governor of Puerto Rico established 11 Regional Staging Areas around the island, serving 77 municipalities."
"- FEMA, working in coordination with federal partners, provided millions of meals and millions of liters of water to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."
Additional meals and water continue to arrive to the islands daily via air and sea.
"**Life Safety and Life Sustaining** - FEMA Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) visited all 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico conducting search and rescue operations, helping assess hospitals, and distributing commodities."
"FEMA US&R task forces saved or assisted 843 individuals and five pets, while searching over 2,600 structures."
"- The DoD continues to operate from Roosevelt Roads Airfield, executing route clearance, commodity and fuel distribution, as well as providing helicopter support to assist officials from *Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)* complete assessments of all Puerto Rican hospitals - The use of medium lift helicopters allows for the flow of needed commodities such as food, water, and fuel to remote areas disconnected from traditional supply lines."
"Six additional military medium lift helicopters arrived in Puerto Rico to continue commodity distribution to affected areas - The U.S. Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority drinking water system is back online, and other drinking water systems on the islands are top priority for receiving generators - The *National Guard* has thousands of Guard members on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands taking part in security and support operations."
"The Air National Guard is focused on transporting food, water, and communications capabilities as well as rapidly increasing airlift into affected areas."
"**Fuel, Transportation, and Debris** - Fifteen *United States Coast Guard *National Strike Force (NSF) teams arrived in PR to conduct post-storm assessments and recovery operations."
- The National Business Emergency Operations Center* (NBEOC) is working with private sector companies to reach additional truck drivers throughout Puerto Rico to enable commodities to reach more remote parts of the island.
- 11 major roads in Puerto Rico are cleared of debris and back open.
- The Federal Highway Administration* (FHWA) made $40 million available to the PR Highways and Transportation Authority (PHRTA) for emergency relief work to impacted roads.
"- 26 chainsaw teams and one Incident Management Team (IMT) from the Department of Agriculture, United States Forest Service* are in Puerto Rico are conducting emergency road clearance and manage logistics."
"- *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)* debris experts are assisting FEMA with debris management strategies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with the *Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)."
"* - The federal government is working with its interagency and private sector partners to support availability, transportation and delivery of fuel, based on priorities identified by Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."
- The Army Corps of Engineers coordinated transportation of more than 300 FEMA or *Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)* generators from across the U.S. to meet anticipated requirements in the islands.
Generators continue to arrive daily to meet temporary power needs.
"Right now, our fellow Americans are suffering--especially the people of Puerto Rico."
"We recognize that when crisis hits, every dollar counts and so does every minute."
Congress continues to work with the administration to make sure the people of Puerto Rico are getting additional help.
"While significant progress has been made, full recovery will be very long and very trying."
But the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands should be reassured that they are entitled to equal treatment under the law and the Appropriations Committee and House Leadership will assure that every step of the way.
It is important to reassure residents and local officials that that we will help them rebuild.
"And of course, the people of New Jersey remain eager to provide whatever assistance they can."
"**The fastest way to help** As with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the most effective means to support recovery of communities affected by Hurricane Maria is to donate time or money to trusted voluntary-, faith- and community-based charitable organizations."
This gives these organizations the ability to purchase what survivors need right now.
"In addition, when these organizations purchase goods or services locally, they pump money back into the local and regional economy, helping businesses recover faster."
"It is important to remember unsolicited donated goods (e.g., clothing, miscellaneous household items, mixed or perishable foodstuffs) require voluntary agencies to redirect valuable resources away from providing services to sort, package, transport, warehouse, and distribute items that may not meet the needs of disaster survivors."
"**Donate through a trusted organization** The National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) lists trusted organizations receiving donations, many of which are already coordinating relief and response efforts in the Caribbean."
The NVOAD website has information on non-profit organizations accepting or registering individual in-kind donations here [link 1].
For corporate donations connect here [link 2].
You may also make financial donations to a National VOAD member organization [link 3] to help voluntary or charitable organizations continue to provide services to Hurricane Maria survivors.

"Visit my website to access more information about Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands here: [link 5] *Key Cosponsorships* In addition to the major legislation I have sponsored in the House of Representatives, I also lend my support to other legislation on a range of important issues."
Here is a sampling of my recent co-sponsorships: *H.R.
2721 - Seniors' Tax Simplification Act.
* The IRS currently prohibits individuals over 65 years old from filing the 1040EZ form even if they have a simple return and choose not to itemize deductions.
"This bill directs the IRS to create a new tax form, the 1040SR, to accommodate the tax needs of seniors while extending the common sense convenience of the 1040EZ form."
This commonsense measure will reduce the burden of filing taxes for senior citizens.
1991 - Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act*.
"This legislation would exempt volunteers providing firefighting or emergency medical services to a state, local government or charity from being counted as full time employees under the Employer Mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."
"As you may remember, the ACA redefined what was considered a full-time employee for the purposes of the employer mandate, which determines whether towns and municipalities must provide health insurance to their workers or pay of fine of as much as $3,000 per employee."
3441 - Save Local Businesses Act.
"* This legislation would clarify that two or more employers must have ""actual, direct, and immediate"" control over employees to be considered joint employers."
"In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board re-defined the term ""joint employer"" to include employers making a business agreement that ""indirectly"" or ""potentially"" impacts their employees' day-to-day responsibilities and working environment."
3165 - Renovate and Enhance Veterans Meeting Halls and Posts (REVAMP).
"* This bill would authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to provide grants to veterans service organizations for upgrading local chapter facilities, including technology at such facilities."
Many New Jersey veterans organizations are struggling with declining memberships and deteriorating post facilities.
"In the last Congress, I introduced a resolution regarding the eligibility of veterans service organizations for Community Development Block Grants."
*H.R.3176 - Disaster Assistance Fairness and Accountability Act*.
"Under current law, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is permitted to require victims to repay disaster assistance if FEMA changes its determination on their eligibility, even if the payment was already made and the mistake was through no fault of the victim."
"This process, known as recoupment, is particularly troublesome because there is no statute of limitations on this type of action."
"3176 sets a statute of limitations of three years for disaster recoupment as long as the recipient's application was made in good faith and they provided accurate information, and they did not receive assistance that was out of the range of what they were expecting to receive."
The measure does nothing to stop FEMA from recouping money from those who have defrauded the government.
2765 - the Perpetual POW/MIA Stamp Act*.
"This legislation would provide for the issuance of a ""forever stamp"" to honor the sacrifices of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who are still prisoner, missing or unaccounted for."
"The Department of Defense reports that more than 83,000 service members remain missing since WWII."
*H.R 3329 - The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act*.
Hizballah is Iran's proxy army across the Middle East.
"This terror organization poses a direct threat to American interests and Israel, props up the Assad regime in Syria, and has hijacked the Lebanese government."
This bipartisan legislation would impose additional sanctions on the terrorist organization and those that support it.
"For a complete listing of the bills I have sponsored and cosponsored, please visit my website here: [link 6] *Congressman Steve Scalise Comes Back to Serve* The prayers of a nation were answered this week as my colleague, Rep. Steve Scalise, returned to the House of Representatives for the first time since he was gunned down by a would-be assassin on June 14."
His bravery and his family's strength have been an inspiration to this House and to all the people it serves.
"To watch Steve Scalise's stirring return to the House and his plea for unity, [link 7]visit: [link 8] *Bringing Suicide ""Out of the Darkness""* I was honored to be asked to participate by Mayor Curt Ritter last weekend in Chatham's annual ""Out of the Darkness"" Community Walk where 250 local residents turned out to shine a spotlight on suicide, especially suicide among children."
"Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in America, claiming over 144,000 family members, friends, neighbors, and business associates each year."
"On average, there are over 120 suicides every day."
Most of the people who die by suicide have an underlying mental health illness.
"In the veterans community, we lose 20 of our comrades each day."
"These are twenty veterans who have left spouses, mothers, fathers, children, siblings and others wondering why."
The VA report indicates that the risk of suicide was 22 percent higher for veterans than those who have not served.
"But among veterans and those who have not served, we all can make a difference."
"If you know someone who is showing signs of depression or has talked about suicide, **there are many ways you can help** [link 9]."
"For example, pay them a visit, meet up for coffee, or invite him or her to participate in a healthy activity like walking or biking."
This week concludes National Suicide Prevention Month.
"But, in reality, it's up to all of us to be on the lookout for anyone possible signs of suicide and take appropriate action."

Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins *Prayers for Puerto Rico & Mexico City:* We have all seen the dramatic footage on our televisions of the damage from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the earthquake in Mexico City.
My thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by these natural disasters.
*Visiting with Kansans:* Every month during a district work week I host open office hours in my Topeka office where any constituent can come in for a one on one meeting with me to discuss issues of concern.
"I had the opportunity to visit with Kansans about a variety of concerns including issues with long term care, healthcare reform and Veterans' benefits."
I also enjoyed visiting with the folks from Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved.
I always appreciate the opportunity to visit with Kansans on issues that are top of mind.
*Touring Topeka Zoo:* Several years ago my office was contacted to assist the Topeka Zoo with some Federal Regulations that were prohibiting the zoo from bringing in an aged authentic safari Land Rover for an exhibit.
This week I had the opportunity to tour the zoo and see the vehicle first hand.
I enjoyed my tour and appreciate all the folks at the Zoo who work everyday to bring an important service to the families of northeast Kansas.
[image = Read more about my visit to the Topeka Zoo in this *Topeka Capital-Journal* article [link 1].
*Tour of Helping Hands Humane Society:* Thank you to Bill and Justin for showing me around Helping Hands Humane Society.

It's always a highlight to see these young kids with bright futures ahead of them and to visit with the wonderful people who are dedicated to helping our future build a solid foundation.
[image = *Stopping by Midwest Minerals in Parsons:* I had the opportunity to visit Midwest Minerals this week and take a tour of their operation.

We discussed a wide range of issues that are important to grow the economy and create jobs for Kansans.
One of the top items discussed was tax reform.
                    HOW CAN ALAN HELP?
"LEGISLATION  47TH DISTRICT  ABOUT ALAN  CONTACT ALAN                 In This Edition This week I attended a committee hearing and markup for the SHARE Act, a seriously flawed bill that would roll back several of our nations most essential commonsense gun safety laws."
"On Monday I hosted my first ever Twitter Town Hall, where I answered questions from constituents in real time on a variety of topics."
"This week, under continued threats from the regime of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the international broadcasting organization Radio Free Asia was forced to shutter its operations inside Cambodia."
"This week in Alans Inbox, see my response to constituents who have contacted my office urging me to cosponsor the Pet and Women Safety Act (PAWS) Act, which wouldprotect pets and their owners in homes facing domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking."
"Be sure to check out Congress U, where I take a look at Regular Order, or the rules and precedents followed by the House and Senate when creating and passing legislation."
"Lastly, dont forget to take this weeks poll in the right-hand column."
CONNECT WITH ME                               Which of the following community features is most important to you when deciding where to live?
"Living expenses, such as housing and transportation costs Economic factors, such as business and job growth Access to nature, including parks and trails Quality of local schools Racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity Community engagement Political environment All are equally important Other     If you have a problem, click here to open survey in a new window               Speaking Out Against the SHARE Acts Rollback of Gun Safety Measures  This week I attended a committee hearing on the Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act."
"This bill was presented by its proponents as legislation intended simply to enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, fishing, and shooting on public lands.In reality, though, the bill contains a long list of anti-conservation measures."
"Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this bill, though, is the extent to which it weakens some of our nations most essential common sense gun safety laws."
The SHARE act would make silencerswhose sole purpose is to make gunfire harder to detecteasier to obtain.
"It would also allow some now-illegal armor piercing ammunition to be sold, as long as the ammunition manufacturer labeled it for sporting purposes."
"Additionally, the bill would allow gun owners in states with fewer gun safety laws to freely travel with their weapons to states with more stringent gun safety laws."
"I believe in ensuring that sportsmen and sportswomen can enjoy all the recreational opportunities our public lands have to offer, but this legislation attacks the very conservation laws that protect those federal lands, seriously relaxes commonsense gun safety precautions, and puts lives at risk from gun violence."
Click  to watch the statement I made during the Natural Resources Committees Markup of the bill.
"The packed house at Tuesdays SHARE Act Hearing included a number of members of the gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, who dressed in red."
"Hosting a Successful Twitter Town Hall  On Monday night, I had a great time hosting my first ever Twitter Town Hall."
"I answered questions from constituents across the district on topics ranging from my stance on Medicare-For-All, to which bill I would choose if I could bring any bill to the House floor for a vote."
"I plan to do this type of event again in the future, so be sure to  to join in, and for real time updates on what Im doing in DC and the 47th district!"
Responding to the Forced Shut-Down of Radio Free Asia in Cambodia Radio Free Asia is an international broadcasting corporation that provides independent news in many countries throughout Asia.
"This week, under continued threats and provocations from the regime of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the organization was forced to shutter its operations inside Cambodia."
"The Hun Sen regime has made it perfectly clear that it has no intention of allowing a free press to exist in Cambodia, and the government appears ready to use any contrivance it canintimidation, threats, coercion, and even outright violenceto prevent the people of Cambodia from having independent, reliable, and trustworthy news that is not filtered through the Hun Sen lens."
"The right of political expression, the right of a free media, and the right to dissent, are all being quashed by Hun Sen to subvert free and fair national elections in Cambodia scheduled for next year."
"As co-chair of the Cambodia caucus, I  on Wednesday in which I express my concern over the situation and call on the United States Ambassador to Cambodia, as well as the Secretary of State, to take any and all actions necessary to assist the Cambodian people."
Each week hundreds of constituents contact my office to share their views on a variety of topics.
I have recently received numerous calls and letters from people expressing their support forthe Pet and Women Safety Act of 2017.
"Below is a portion of my response to those communications: The Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act would protect pets and their owners in homes facing domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking."
It does so by directing the Department of Agriculture to provide grants for housing assistance and support services for domestic violence victims with pets.
"I believe that victims of domestic violence should not have to worry about the wellbeing of their pets when seeking safety for themselves, and for that reason I am a proud cosponsor of this important legislation."
"As your representative, I will keep fighting for animal welfare and ensure that our laws provide strong protections for animals and victims of domestic abuse."
"If you have written in to me, please continue to do so."
"If you have not, I encourage you to share your views and concerns with me, as it is the best way for me to find out which issues you care most about."

"Regular Order ""Regular order"" refers to the formal processes that govern the House and Senate."
It consists of rules and precedents followed with few exceptions when creating or passing legislation.
"Simply put, regular order means the normal legislative process, and it goes something like this:   A bill is introduced by its author on the floor of either the House or the Senate."
It is given a number and then the majority leadership assigns the bill to a committee--or more than onethat has jurisdiction over whatever the bill covers.
"For example, a bill about restricting mining on federal lands would be sent to the House Natural Resources Committee (which I sit on)."
The chairman of the committee decides whether to consider the bill and when.
Public hearings are scheduled in coordination with the ranking (most senior) member of the opposition party on that committee.
"Once hearings are complete, the committee chairman brings forward a version of the bill he or she likes and schedules a ""markup"" to consider amendments."
"Members of the committee--from both parties--offer amendments, debate them, and then vote on them."
"If the committee votes to approve the bill, the bill then goes to the Floor of the House or Senate for a vote of the full body."
"Its important to remember that regular order is not just a process, but also a state of mind."
Regular order implies that a certain level of comity and bipartisanship is required to govern.
This is what has been lost by the abandonment of regular order in recent years.

"CONTACT ME  The Congressional Connector Week of September 11 - 15, 2017 Column: More Rights for Mexican Workers Will Benefit US Jobs and Trade Rep. Levin authored a column in the Financial Times sharing the need to shore up labor rights for Mexican workers as a way to help increase the wages of American workers."
"The column explained that extremely low wages have given Mexico an advantage when it comes to attracting auto manufacturing plants, and that by 2020 it will be the fifth-largest auto producer in the world."
There?s no reason such plants shouldn?t be built in the U.S. -- but any new NAFTA must include stronger labor provisions to help that effort.
