{"title": "Defense and National Security", "content": "The nation\u2019s defense is the first and primary mission of the federal government.\u00a0 Some voices in Congress have long supported a dramatic decrease in our military spending as a means of moving the United States away from our role as a world superpower and into a lesser, more complementary role supporting a military on par with other Western nations, especially those in the European Union.\u00a0 I could not disagree more.\u00a0 At a time when terrorist nations and those whom they support are actively seeking to end our way of life, our national defense is as important as it has ever been.We have asked so much\u2014and continue to ask more\u2014of our men and women in uniform, and we must ensure that they have the equipment, training, and other resources they need to accomplish their missions.That said, there are ways we can make better use of our defense budget, and I am in favor of using Congress\u2019 oversight role to look into the process by which the Pentagon procures its weapons systems and other goods and services.\u00a0 We must also take a look at how some in Congress have come to use the Pentagon budget as a way of channeling money into their districts through unwanted and wasteful projects.\u00a0 Simply reforming these two areas of the defense budget can net large savings without undermining our military needs.The men and women of our Armed Forces are the bedrock upon which our freedom and liberty are built, and I will never turn my back on them.\u00a0 I will fight every day in Congress to make sure they are fairly compensated, receive the health benefits they have earned, and find all the support they need when their time of service is over.\u00a0 Our military and veterans are a national treasure, and we must make sure they are honored in a manner befitting their service.My office stands ready to assist service members, their families and veterans in dealing with federal departments and agencies.\u00a0 If you are struggling with a federal agency, pleaseto visit the House Armed Services Committee's website. \u00a0"},
{"title": "Energy", "content": "The United States is one of the most blessed countries in the world when it comes to its abundant natural resources. However, our nation\u2019s energy policy has long been based on the interests of individuals rather than the best interest of our nation, and as a result, we\u2019ve been left with a fragmented energy policy. For both economic and national security reasons, America needs a strong and diversified national energy portfolio.From the Gulf of Mexico to the coasts of Alaska, we have almost unlimited untapped resources. For too long we were dependent on foreign imports, which was truly a national security concern, but I am pleased that since the beginning of the 21st Century, the U.S. energy sector has undergone tremendous changes that have resulted in the U.S. becoming a global leader in energy production. In fact, despite high levels of domestic demand, our crude oil and petroleum product exports are reaching record levels. In order to reflect the energy wealth and stability that our land currently holds, we must develop and strengthen our national energy portfolio.Though I strongly support the continued development of fossil fuels, I also happily support the increased use of renewable, sustainable energies. However, we have experimented with many competing forms of renewable energy in the past 30 years, spending billions of dollars subsidizing the technologies with the best lobbyists rather than the technologies with the most long-term promise.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we should redirect our scarce financial resources towards the research and development of transformational new technologies rather than propping up legacy renewables that still can\u2019t compete on their own after decades of federal support. \u00a0For instance, I have supported the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), which identifies and supports projects with the potential to revolutionize American energy. The first-dollar federal support made possible by ARPA-E allows startups and entrepreneurs to leverage private capital to create good-paying American jobs, some of which are right here in the Seventh District.\u00a0 The path towards real, sustainable energy independence in America starts by finding and making smart, targeted investments in these kind of cutting-edge technologies will produce a renewable energy revolution that is powered by consumer demand rather than government force.Finally, I support initiatives that educate Americans on common-sense conservation measures that provide dual benefits of reusing energy and saving money.\u00a0 Conservation is an issue upon which all Americans should be able to agree; there are ways to conserve energy more and protect the Earth we have been blessed with.\u00a0 With that said, energy conservation initiatives should rest in the hands of individual Americans and their state and local officials\u2014not the Federal government."},
{"title": "Budget", "content": "Reining in out-of-control federal spending and paying down our national debt has been, and will continue to be, one of my top priorities as your voice in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 As a member of the House Budget Committee, I\u2019ve played an active role in crafting the seven budget resolutions put forth by the House Republicans since we took control of the House in 2011, and looking back now, I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in those few years.\u00a0 Federal discretionary spending fell each year from 2011 to 2015, and federal deficits are 60% lower today than they were in 2009, which was President Obama\u2019s first year in office.\u00a0 And none of that is funny Washington, DC math, those are real dollars!\u00a0Of course we have a lot more work to do, as our national debt exceeds $20 trillion today, and though we\u2019ve had a great deal of success reining in federal discretionary spending over the last few years, if we are ever going to reach a point where we can begin paying down our national debt, it is absolutely essential that we address the driver of our budget deficits and national debt: mandatory federal spending.\u00a0 Mandatory spending is the kind of federal spending that occurs year after year without Congressional approval; it\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cautopilot\u201d spending.\u00a0 Mandatory spending includes programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, other federal health care programs--including Obamacare--interest on our national debt, certain tax expenditures, and more.\u00a0 While many of those programs are vitally important, they will be responsible for 81% of the total federal spending by 2040, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m committed to crafting federal budgets that will tackle the difficult fiscal challenges that lie ahead for our nation, and I\u2019m confident that the House Budget Committee will continue to build on the successes we\u2019ve had in recent years.\u00a0 I look forward to your continued partnership in that effort.\u00a0Click here\u00a0Click here\u00a0Click here\u00a0\u00a0"},

{"title": "Second Amendment", "content": "It is a common misconception that the main purpose of the U.S. Constitution is to delineate all of our rights as American citizens.\u00a0 In reality, the Constitution does two things: It provides a framework for every American to understand his or her most basic right and it highlights the boundaries of the federal government\u2019s power.\u00a0The simultaneous declaration of the rights of Americans and the constraints of the federal government are the bedrock of our Republic.\u00a0 The concept of individual rights working in harmony with government constraints is as revolutionary an idea today as it was in 1776.Citizens across the Seventh District of Georgia regularly use firearms in responsible ways for sporting, hunting and self-protection.\u00a0These law-abiding individuals are not robbing banks or going on shooting sprees.\u00a0 They are teaching their children how to responsibly use guns, to take seriously firearm safety and to understand the consequences of failing to do so.\u00a0Unfortunately, there are too many federal government officials who believe it is acceptable to trample on the rights\u00a0of these law-abiding citizens because there are some Americans who would use guns to perpetrate violence.\u00a0I am proud to say that I am not that kind of elected official.\u00a0I believe it is important to preserve the power of the Constitution and the basic rights that it entails.\u00a0As the U.S. Representative for the Seventh District of Georgia, I will do my part to protect citizens\u2019 basic rights to bear arms by supporting local law enforcement in their mission to stop gun violence and stop unconstitutional legislation from infringing upon the Second Amendment.\u00a0"},

{"title": "Transportation", "content": "Downtown Buford, GAI-85 runs right through the heart of the Seventh District of Georgia\u00a0and its residents rely heavily on GA-316, GA-400, and US-78.\u00a0 Millions of cars travel up and down I-85 to and from people's work in Atlanta to their homes in Gwinnett and Forsyth Counties. \u00a0Without these resources, growth and prosperity in our area would be unimaginable.Of course, the interstate highway system is but one part of our nation's transportation infrastructure \u2013 roads, bridges, ports, railroads, and airplanes are all vital transportation resources that keep our economy moving forward. In fact, one single port deepening project at our state's Savannah Harbor is worth an estimated $115 million annually in added economic benefits to the country. \u00a0A well-functioning air traffic control system can avert potential airplane disasters and save time and money by drastically reducing air travel delays. Integrated railway systems can reduce our use of fossil fuels, thereby saving Americans millions of dollars every year on high fuel costs for transporting goods across the country.A comprehensive transportation policy that integrates the needs of the federal government with that of state and local transportation agencies is essential to our nation's economic future. As a member of the House Transportation and\u00a0Infrastructure\u00a0Committee, I will work with my colleagues in the House to pass common-sense legislation that relies more on innovation and careful use of our scarce financial resources than on tax increases.A crucial part of viable transportation policy is returning as many transportation decisions and dollars to the states.\u00a0 It is only at the local level that our dollars can be put to the highest and best use.\u00a0In the meantime, the federal government must be responsible stewards of transportation money moving forward.To learn more about transportation issues, please visit the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee website at\u00a0"},
{"title": "FairTax", "content": "By far, the piece of legislation that I am most passionate about is\u00a0The FairTax is a simple plan that people can understand, get excited about, and support 100% because it is a plan of hope. It is a plan to remove the heavy hand of government from your personal pocketbook and put you in charge of your finances and your life. Our nation was founded on the fundamental concept of individual freedom. Our current income tax system taxes hard work\u2014stripping Americans of their incentive to work hard and pursue the American dream.The American people deserve better, and I am proud to be their champion in Congress who will fight to restore freedom.People from all over the world flock to America to pursue a better life free from tyranny and oppression, yet as government and taxation grows this vision is threatened. Our founders came to America seeking independence and freedom, and when that freedom was challenged by the British government, they threw off the shackles of tyranny and made a radical decision. History shows us that the critical decision our Founding Fathers made on July 4, 1776, reverberated around the world in defense of freedom. Our Founding Fathers were not afraid to challenge a government that was infringing on their personal freedoms, and today we cannot be afraid either. Though we thankfully do not face such dire circumstances as our Founding Fathers did, we do face a government gone out of control. I believe that one simple solution to this problem is the FairTax.The FairTax is a plan for every American, no matter what his or her income might be. Specifically, the FairTax would repeal all Federal corporate and individual income taxes, payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, capital gains taxes, the death tax, and gift taxes - and replace them with a revenue-neutral personal consumption tax. Overnight, the FairTax would allow individuals to keep 100% of their income without the government taking a penny up front. Overnight, we would eliminate the IRS from the lives of all American workers.Allow me to give you some fundamental truths that relate to the FairTax and are the bedrock of what make this legislation so special.\u2022 Transparency:\u00a0\u2022 Simplicity:\u00a0\u2022 Fairness:\u00a0\u2022 American Dream:\u00a0\u2022 Freedom:\u00a0When the Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress studied what would happen if a national consumption tax were implemented, economists from the far left to the far right agreed that the American economy would grow faster under a true consumption tax system than it does today.The promise of the FairTax is an American economy that can continue to grow and thrive in the 21st century.

{"title": "Health", "content": "Health care is one of the most important issues facing American families and our nation\u2019s federal budget.\u00a0 Whether you are concerned about control over your health care choices, maintaining the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship, Medicare Part D benefit changes, reimbursement payments for physicians, federal requirements for Medicaid and ERISA-controlled plans, TRICARE benefits for veterans, or pharmaceutical development regulations\u2014to name only a few important areas\u2014the interference of the federal government in the health care sector has grown to a destructive level and continues to spiral out-of-control.Our first order of business as a Republican-led House of Representatives was to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. \u00a0We must replace it\u00a0with targeted health care reforms that will produce real cost savings for American families without masking the true cost of reform to the federal government.\u00a0 Clearly, more federal control of health care is not the answer.The federal government has managed Medicare into near bankruptcy.\u00a0 The government-funded and controlled health policies in the Affordable Care Act will soon be no different.\u00a0 We must instead focus on common-sense reforms, like modifying our medical liability laws, expanding access and use of consumer-driven products like Health Savings Accounts, and dealing with the challenge of Medicare physician reimbursements.\u00a0 Rather than fixing these problems, Congress has been content enacting short-term patches and kicking the can down the road for future Congresses to deal with.\u00a0 I look forward to accepting that challenge and working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to find real solutions.Common-sense solutions so often come from those individuals whose daily experiences challenge them to bring new ideas to their Representatives in Washington.\u00a0 As we move through the 115th Congress, I will continue to hold town hall meetings both in person and over the phone so that all the Seventh District residents can make both their challenges and solutions known.\u00a0 To find out when and where my next Town Hall will be, please "}
